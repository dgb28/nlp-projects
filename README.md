# 📚 NLP-Projects

This repository contains NLP projects that explore **text classification** using classical machine learning techniques:

1. **📝 Logistic Regression – Sentiment Analysis**  
   Classifies text reviews as positive or negative using bag-of-words features and custom engineered features. Includes hyperparameter tuning, analysis of influential words, and evaluation on train/dev/test datasets.

2. **🤖 Human vs Machine Text Classification**  
   Distinguishes human-written text from machine-generated text using bigram features with Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. Includes feature importance analysis, regularization effects, and interpretability insights.
