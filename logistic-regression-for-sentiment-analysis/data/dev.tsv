0	terrible service and for some reason , brunch was quite disappointing . the croque madame did not taste as good as it did last time and left a strange after taste .
0	came here after my friends all raved about it . we arrived and there was a brief wait . i figured , hmmm ... there are people here ... that 's a good sign . unfortunately , it did n't quite live up to my expectations . here 's what i got : -combination platter with catfish , brisket , sweet potato fries , and double baked potatoes ( for how much i paid i was expecting a larger portion ; brisket was good ; the catfish had an odd taste and odor - did n't really care for it ; i had to pay extra for the sweet potato fries but it came with like 5 fries ! ! grr . the twice baked potatoes were ok but suuuuuuper small cup of it ) -burnt ends ( delish ) the food was a disappointment but the service was even worst ! the server asked how the daiquiri was and my friend said it was n't what she expected and he pounced on her interrogating her for why she did n't like it . im sorrry your drinks are n't good . you never attack the customer ! so rude . he should 've apologized and offered her another drink . later he asked about the food and we mentioned the catfish and he had the same reaction ! i was stunned . overall , the food and service left much more to be desired ...
0	i ordered the phx cheesesteak combo which came with a ridiculous amount of curly fries ( greasy and a bit undercooked ) and a small drink . the brisket was very good with an appropriate amount of bbq sauce . the lunch was rather costly . at just under $ 10 for a lunch combo , this is a place i will not frequent very often .
1	love this place for strange reasons i guess ... i love their cole slaw , fries , and burgers ! its sort of a swanky joint , and you would n't think the items i mentioned would be that great ... but , they are ! classy atmosphere , other fare is pretty good as well . good place to hang and have a drink too , especially if you have to wait for a table .
1	glad i read many reviews before going to nobu . the rock shrimp tempura that so many recommended did not disappoint ! ... excellent stuff .... my favorite dish was the sea bass with balsamic teriyaki ( hot dish ) was one of the best seafood dishes i have ever had . although the rock shrimp tempura was great , the shrimp and vegetable tempura was disappointing , especially for 36 dollars . the rock shrimp tempura is far cheaper and is much better . the prices are high , but the service never disappointed , and the decor was also very nice .
1	always good - customer service was spectacular . not your typical fast food experience they actually come to your table to make sure you have everything you need/ordered and are satisfied . the food was delicious . closed sunday . i would recommend trying this if you never have been to chick-fil-a . salads are fresh and the chicken is moist .
0	last review i left was for what used to.be my favorite el.pollo loco . last 2 visits were very disappointing . the drive thru window is slacking now . dont ask me if i want salsa if your not going to give it ( last two visits they forgot the salsa ! ! ! ) this time no salsa , tortillas , napkins or a reciept . so disappointed . i will continue to visit this place , sucks i have to babysit you and double check my order . come on guys get your shit back together ! ! !
0	wow ! is all i have to say . i have not even got onto my flight yet and i am extremely angry as i write this . i booked a flight from las vegas to la to visit my girlfriend . the flight was only $ 100 round trip . i went on-line to confirm my flight and check in ... i had to pay $ 10 dollars for a seat both ways- so an additional $ 20 then to even check my bag as a carry on i had to pay $ 33 each way so an additional $ 66 my $ 100 flight turned into almost a $ 200 flight . it would be nice if companies such as cheapoair or priceline would advise you that when you book with this company that there will be extra fees . also my bags were supposed to be $ 28 a bag but the on-line system charged me $ 33 . i called spirit ( which had the most difficult time finding a customer service phone number ) to ask them why i am paying more money than what is stated . the lady advised me that if i confirmed my flight 24 hours or less prior to my flight starting , that i had to pay an additional fee for my bag . how is this company still in business .... ? i should have paid $ 150 with southwest who i know i can trust . i have been reading all these reviews - and i am so scared to even get onto my flight ..... i am not good with rude customer service .. especially when i am already very upset . luckily it is only a 1 hour flight- so i should be okay ..... if only i would of yelped them prior to booking .... all i saw was cheap cheap cheap rates flashing across the screen ... and overlooked and did n't use my yelp . yelp will never fail you , because there are real people with real reviews that you can trust . next time i will never book anything without reading about it first : (
1	we have a self appointed coffee connoisseur staying us from another country who loves a quality cappuccino . they tried starbucks and were very disappointed . they then began the quest to find a quality coffee shop that could provide a great cappuccino . a few offered something decent but fell short . the quest ended when we found rush espresso . we 've been back 3 times and all three times they have delivered wonderful tasting cappuccinos with italian cycling cafe styled decor . we have n't tried the food , but the coffee is great .
0	been once before -- several years ago -- but just for drinks . tried it for dinner last night . as suggested by many yelpers , i stuck with the tapas while my wife ordered pad thai . i ordered a variety of tapas -- spring rolls , crab/cream cheese , dumplings , satay beef . all rather disappointing , especially the satay bef which looked and tasted like ground meat reconstituted to look like slices . and while i 'm not a fan of the over-sized portions most pgh restaurants serve , the tapas servings were very skimpy . my wife 's pad thai was all right , but nothing special . the food seemed more `` fast food '' asian than fine dining . and the prices are just too high for the level of food quality and quantity . the service was good , except for our seating . when we arrived , the place was nearly empty . we were seated at a two-top right next to the only other couple in the restaurant . yea , i could have asked for other seating , but , at the time we were seated , i did n't care . the couple next to us , however , seemed to be right out of snl 's `` loud family '' sketch .
0	met coworkers here for sunday brunch on one of the rare fabulous day , where vegas is actually not hot as he11 in the middle of aug. thank the rains early this morning and the slightly overcast sky for the awesome 90f temperature . anyway , we were seated in the patio area facing the fountain of bellagio . unfortunately we were way too early for any of that signature spectacle , otherwise it would have been an memorable end to a fantastic casual breakfast with friends . but let 's get down to the meat of the review . the restaurant was not full inside when we arrived , and we were greeted by three friendly hostesses at the front desk . the patio seating area was completely packed by 9am , so business was excellent . our waitress greeted us with a friendly smile , took our coffee order and proceeded to explain the specials of the day . we ended up ordering a mushroom omlete , crepe-like stake of cinnamon pancakes ( these were huge ) , and i ordered the special eggs benedict ( served with roast beef and caramelized onions ) . overall , i was n't impressed with the food and here are my reasons : the hollandaise sauce for my eggs benedict was already starting to break when it was served . the roast beef was way overcooked and there were very little of it tucked under the poached eggs . the side of `` breakfast potatoes '' aka hash browns reminded me of denny 's . the mushroom omelet was okay . it is nothing fancy , and you can probably get similar quality omelet at ihop , but the view and ambiance is better here . the crepe-like pancakes - these were nice and thin and fluffy . the flavor was excellent . worth it , since the food is delicious and more unique . service : excellent & friendly ! our coffee cups were frequently refilled . condiments we asked for to make the meal better were delivered in a timely manner . price : includes the vegas strip premium . suggestions : for breakfast , stick to the fruit or non-savory breakfast items , it appears to be better . or come for dinner and lunch since those offerings appears to look better .
0	my best friend and i went to matt 's big breakfast a few weeks ago after i read the rave reviews here on yelp . postitives : free parking , huge portions , delicious food taste just like your grandmothers big yummy breakfast , really cute and quaint decor , we were seated immediately , great location downtown phoenix . i ordered the cheese omelet , it came quick and it was gigantor and delicious , thick slices of toast came with it and my hashbrows were the best i 've ever tasted in life negatives : it can not be underemphasized how miniature this place is , very small menu options , cost is a bit inflated i recommend it for a try .
1	i live near one of these locations and i travel to the further location ! why you ask ? well customer service ! tiffany is incredibly helpful , so nice and is n't a pushy sales person ! i am so thankful i ran into this store one day and found her . this verizon location sells one of the best products and has an awesome display of phones . lots to choose from . you can also pay your bill here . there is a $ 3 service charge if you pay cash but if you use your card there is no charge . who can beat that ? i am definitely going to use my upgrades here and provide this location all of my future business ! especially if tiffany is there ! do n't get me wrong , everyone is very nice but she is pretty cool . if you need a verizon wireless store , stop by . i bet you wo n't be upset that you did . guaranteed ! !
0	the food was ok , but you should try a different chinese restaurant . the last time i went there was around 7pm , and the food was not fresh at all .
1	if you are not from the area , just the very mention of `` the y '' invokes images of outdated facilities , worn out equipment and a sketchy membership base . a visit to the harris y in southpark should erase all such visual associations . like other metro charlotte ys , the harris has abundant floor space with relatively new cardio and strength training equipment . these pieces are largely leased so as to ensure they stay up to date and in good repair . large studios are available for group exercise classes of numerous different varieties and there are basketball courts for both kids and adult leagues . there is also a nice fitness-themed cafe with smoothies and other light fare , and even a gymnastics studio . clearly the metro ys looked at their competition and have come to compete . yes , the membership price can be a little high in comparison , but if you want plenty of options to get your sweat on and enjoy an organization that has proven staying power and plenty of social options , then the y wins hands down . the harris is a family y , so they have programs and options specifically for children . they also have both family-oriented locker rooms and facilities for adults only . bottom line : if you do not want to be bothered with little ones running amok , you can get away at the harris . for me , there best selling point is both the indoor and outdoor water parks . these facilities could rival just about any country club pool in the county . indoors is open year-round and has 2 pools , one for fitness and the other for fun . this includes both a huge water slide and kids-friendly climbing options with shallow waters . the outdoor facility includes both a kiddie pool splash park and full size pool with both fitness lanes and plenty of room for recreational waders . a deep end complete with multiple water slides makes sure everyone stays happy . life guards are always on duty and do take the job seriously . no swimming at your own risk here- smaller kids even have to complete a swim test to earn access to the water slides and unattended entry into the full size pool . the surrounding concrete pool deck has abundant chairs for sunbathing and covered tables for finding a cool spot to escape the sun . a drink machine is available , but i see many folks bring a small cooler with drinks and a snack for all-day pool lounging . outdoor pools are only open memorial day to labor day , far too short for the carolina summer , but when you have the chance , do go and enjoy . the rest of the year is for inside , and luckily the facility is nice enough to keep the workouts enjoyable .
0	here is another one star for this place . i purchased a living social voucher for paint less dent repair with recon . i called up and spoke with dave and make an appointment 2 weeks in advance . i explained that i had some scratches and a fender dent on my car . on the day of the appointment , i could n't find the place so i called dave again and he gave me directions . when i arrived , dave was not there but another guy was there . he told me that the person who does dent repair is not there and that i should have confirmed my appointment the day before ! i said , wtf ! ? ! ? ! it 's not my responsibility to confirm appointments . nonetheless , the person called dave and i do n't know what was said except for the fact that i need to come back some other time . i asked him to call the guy who fixes the dents . he called that guy and was told that he is booked and i would need to call him and make an appointment . what the hell did i do in the first place ? i made an appointment and they did n't honor it . dave should have contacted me back , since he had my phone number and apologize and find out what needs to happen in order to make me happy . i contacted living social and was given a refund . i understand that even with using a living social voucher the cost of the repairs might exceed the value and i was prepared to pay extra to get my car fixed right the first time . so i do n't want a response saying that i was a cheapskate . stay away from this d grade operation .
0	i moved to az/skysong from chicago in april and was initially impressed with the cleanliness and loved that it was brand new . however , after living there for six months i am no longer impressed . there was a yelp contest that if you listed a positive review , you were entered to win money off your rent so please keep that in mind as you read other reviews . below are just a few of the issues i have encountered : the buildings are very poorly constructed . we have been unable to use our balcony because after reporting the concrete was cracking and tar was seeping up , it was found to be structurally unsound . we first reported this in late august and they are just now fixing it with numerous delays . we are just one of several residents who have encountered this issue . they advertise the units have been insulated to be soundproof . it is true apartment to apartment , we have yet to hear our neighbors but you can hear your neighbors above and below you . it is pretty bad when sound travels up . i do not expect the best appliances in an apartment . i am realistic and know i am renting . however , i do expect my appliances in an apartment to last beyond six months of use . the worst of the breakdowns was the motor in our air conditioner failed in early september ( yep , that was a hot weekend in our house ) . i also expect our brand new oven to operate better than my previous mid 70 's oven . ge came out to check on our oven as it ranges 50 degrees off and takes just under two hours to stabilize it 's temperature . we were told they were not insulated well and therefore , it is what it is . additionally but not as important our dishwasher and washing machine has broken . also , check out the unit you are moving into as the fridge in the units are much smaller than shown in the models . i will say , we have gotten to know the maintenance staff fairly well and they are super nice and helpful . it is also very important to note that the parking garage is not for the apartment tenants only but shared with the business park ( this was not disclosed prior to signing by the staff ) . not only does this make parking difficult ( you can only purchase one reserved spot per unit on the floor ) . my husband and i pay $ 75 for one reserved space and $ 45 for an unreserved space which means constantly fighting non-tenants for a spot and often parking on the fourth or fifth floor which does n't have access to the apartment building . also , this arrangement decreases security as a number of non-tenants are coming in and out . the `` secured '' garage was touted when we first met with the skysong office , however , it has come to our attention there are no cameras in the parking garage and there have been multiple thefts in the garage . lastly , this does not apply to some but if you are a smoker or have friends who come over and smoke , do not live here . this is a no smoking community . that includes your balconies and patios for both interior and exterior units . the lease will say , `` smoking is permitted in exterior areas only . '' i was just informed that actually means off the property or at a small park over near the office buildings .
0	i have visited this bistro several times since paris hotel and casino is one of my favorite casinos to visit when i am in vegas . i was also familiar with the original in chicago . this last visit was not a happy occassion but you can only stand homecooked food for a certain time before you decide to go out when you visit family . the meal itself was good , i had steak dijon well done ( as requested ) and my partner had the skate . he had the soup of the day vegetarian style ( very good ) and i had the salade maison . overall the whole meal was satisfactory including the drinks . one note , bistros are normally small in france and in the context of vegas , nothing is small so this one has a lot of space and its outdoor patio has the view of the dancing fountains of bellagio . the service itself is exemplary except for the wait . the salad and the soup came on a reasonable time but the entree was really a long wait . in any restaurant , this is not excusable especially for a place not really very crowded . when you finish the appetizer/soup/salad , you expect the dinner to come at an appropriate time . little quibble but prices should reflect overall service , food , timing and other extras . one more thing , great warm bread and always ask for more if you are really enjoying , it will be good for your soup and waiting on the rest of the dinner . no dessert to review , only had espresso . overall recommended but not highly .
1	the ambience was excellent , the food was subperb . i do recommend thus place if your ever in vegas !
0	total rip off ! ! $ 16.95 for a banana creme pie . recently , they changed the presentation of the pie to feature a dome of whipped cream . once you cut in to enjoy the pie you soon find out it is 75 % cream and maybe one or two bananas and some not so tasty yellow custard . after being a customer for ten years i will never go back . yuck ! gross ! !
0	ok , i 'm approaching this from the business/convention visitor perspective , and that it is a doubletree . the bad : if you 've got status with hhonors , you expect certain things that go with each brand . with doubletree , your stay opens with `` the cookie '' . well , unless you 're hungry for cardboard , you 're going to be disappointed - you get a certificate for a cookie , which the caf\u00e9 may or may not be open . breakfast buffet for gold and higher ( i 'm higher ) ? nope , you may select three items from the cafeteria ... and the line may take longer to get through than a real buffet . at worst with the dt , i 've been given a free continental breakfast with a option to buy the full one . the cafeteria was a no-go . note this was a change from a year prior when i stayed and we were given access to the buffet . wireless internet was not good , and very oddly worded . when you get online , it almost make it look like you 're limited on the download to like 1mb . in truth you are limited to speed - not total content download . in the end , i could live with it , but had to fire up the verizon card ( connectivity issue there too ) to get skype working . fitness center that closes at 7pm ? big miss . pool closing at 7pm ? big miss . the good : the beds were comfortable and clean as was the room . ( points deducted for the old , rusted tub ) . for a casino , the area downstairs was n't horrible . i 'd label it a good business class hotel with a casino . this place misses the doubletree brand promise at several points . take away the expectations of the doubletree and its ok. the pool and fitness center closings chapped me .
1	my favorite casual place . the specials are always amazing , but the ding-dong chicken sandwich is amazing too , so the decision on what to get is soooo hard . burgers are good , coffee is good , bloody mary 's are good ... hell , everything is good ! pimpn ' fries w/ bacon ? yes , please ! only place in town with a vegetarian hot dog ( lots of vegetarian friendly , but not vegan friendly options ) . only wish they had a larger local beer selection and it would be perfect . ps- save yourself the trouble and park across the street in the bail bonds lot - they rent this lot and it is easier to park there .
1	i had to sit on this review for awhile because the excitement when i first tried it was overpowered by my excitement for trying something different . now that my head is clear and the over-enthusiasm died down , i can write a fair review . this place was a random stop after checking out the liquor store for a christmas gift . ita cute and loud ( music ) with coolers as chairs -- just like back home when we would party on the beach . the menu is simple : tacos , hot dog , sides and fried dough . we ordered a chicken taco , fries , hot dogs and sweet dough . to be honest , it 's all good . the texture of the dogs are awesome , as are the tacos . great flavors , great combo of the whole korean spices with hot dogs and tacos . overall , i 'd eat there again for sure . i hope that they continue to serve what they have now . fried dough is a great way to cool off the palette from the spicy flavors , so order a basket . great experience !
0	went to dc steak house for dinner with my family on a sunday night . this place was packed ! i am glad that i had a reservation as people were being turned away . getting seated was a bit of an issue . two parties that came in after us were seated before us . i had to speak to the hostess to ensure we got seated . the food was great we all enjoyed our meals . what i did not enjoy was a lot of additional charges . i did not find out the `` small charge '' until the bill arrived and no substitutions are allowed . so if you do not want a potato you have to pay extra for a vegetable . even though they are the same price on the menu these extra charges increased my daughters meal almost 50 % and this is not acceptable . the food was good but the service issues may prevent me from returning .
0	it was $ 20 to neuter my male cat , they require you to pay $ 15 for pain medication , but they do not give you a cone for the cat , it was an extra $ 30 , which i was upset about seeing as you are told to keep the cat from licking down there for 5 days . i do sleep ! i do have a job ! i ca n't watch him 24/7 . the line was preeeeetty long , too , to drop him off and to pick him up , but for the price i paid , it was n't bad . also , when i finally got him home , the entire back half of him was soaking wet with water . i called back and they said they must not have had time to dry him seeing as i came sooner than expected ( they give you a time frame from 4-5 to pick up your cat and i came at 4:30 , i 'm not exactly sure how that 's sooner than expected ) . there is a little red bubble like thing coming out of my cat 's ballsack , which i also asked about . they said it was normal , but i could come back in to sew it up better ( my bf did not want to go , he said he was fine , so we did n't end up going ) . all in all though , i 'm happy with the price i paid . if anyone else wants that price , go to catnipandtuck.org !
1	highly recommended to me as the `` new '' `` best '' `` better than wynn '' buffet on the strip , my girlfriends and i were pretty excited to check out this buffet in the cosmopolitan . the first try was a fail , since we arrived after the 3:30pm closing time . on second try , we arrived around 2pm , thinking perhaps we had missed the lunch rush .... quiet hallways leading down to the buffet ...... no line to the cashier .... and stop . the line of people waiting to be seated looked comparably long to the one at the wynn we saw the day before . however , this line did n't move as fast , if even perceptibly at all . by the time we got seated nearly 45 min , we were starved , and thirsty ! the extra $ 8 for unlimited champagne was worth it , although refills did n't happen at exactly the speed i 'm used to at nyc brunches . so was the $ 40 price tag worth it ? ( $ 30 + alcohol + tax ) yup . the small plate style of many of the food options made the buffet less trough-like , and although we caught the tail end of brunch , everything was still fresh and hot . i avoided the token asian dishes ( lo mein , fried rice , kung pao chicken ) , and focused on the real food - boiled egg with avocado and bacon vinaigrette , omelet bar , sashimi , lamb chops , steamed clams ..... i could go on , but basically this was the classiest buffet i 'd seen . the desserts were my favorite - there were actually lactose/gluten free options ! i had a choice of several sorbets , as well as a house-made marshmallow served in a dark chocolate cone . great service ( we never felt rushed out ) , and nice spacious table set ups in addition to the non-buffet like food really made this a great dining experience .
1	most amazing salon ive ever been to ! ! ! vicky has done my nails and is always soooo sweet and does the most perfect job . she takes her time and is so detailed . everytime i come in all the staff is welcoming and extremely friendly . i wo n't ever go to another nail salon ! thanks modern nails for the best nails in town
0	it 's no espetus or even fogo , but the line was non-existent so we got seated in under 10 minutes . that 's good , right ? my manager brought me and some colleagues here . well , we 'd aimed for another restaurant but their wait was 45 minutes and growing . so we wandered over here . no line , as i mentioned , and about half of the tables were empty . lots of shrimp cocktails moving around the place , and i did n't see the ever popular `` meat on swords '' until we 'd been there for about 15 minutes . thought maybe it was conventional table service , which made no sense . the food was pretty good , and one upside to eating here is that they give you a light side salad and one bowl of bread , so you do n't fill up on the salad bar ( as can be tempting at more upscale churrascarias ) . they took care of the `` cooked '' ( well-done ) meat eaters at our table , and the `` let me hear it moo before i eat it '' eaters as well . i probably would n't be eager to go back , but if i were in a hurry to get seated and pig out , i 'd give it serious consideration . i did n't see the bill ( thanks dan ! ) so i ca n't speak to price or value , but i 'd go with meh+ on this venue .
0	1 ) they dont know how to control their fire alarm system at 5am . it went off for over two hours with no fire , on and off . a lady at the front desk was turning the system off whenever it came on . 2 ) they send people to other hotels when they still have availability ( spring hill suites , double the room at twice the rate , when they both have ample room available . ) 3 ) they tell people who do n't have reservations that they ca n't check in early , when they never sold out the day before . 4 ) i would expect a toilet to flush . 5 ) i expect the appliances not to be tilted , and the rooms to be clean for this kind of review . 6 ) why did n't the manager send us a letter about the alarm in the morning , where 's the apology ? 7 ) what is going to happen to thismplace tomorrow ? ! ? ! 8 ) how in the world did they get any stars on google , sounds like fake reviews to me . 9 ) their `` itallian night , '' ended up being `` leftover night . '' thank you yelp , for letting me tell the story of elite members . keep your candy bars , chandler residence inn .
0	nice looking place located in the district at green valley ranch . three visits all with inconsistant food quality , and bad service . i 'm not sure what is worse , the level of service or the food quality . i tend to order the same thing from the menu and each time the calimari was served differently and the portions were never consistant . the service is horrible , always training new staff who seem to not have one clue as far as service is concerned . this place is a glossy version of chili 's for people who do n't know any better .
0	i 've been staying here every time i 've come to pittsburgh since the hotel opened . when it first opened 4 years ago , it was awesome ! since then , it 's started to get a dated , but was until recently one of the best hotels in the area . however , recently they changed ownership and it 's gone downhill . i had 3 complaints about my recent stay : 1 ) they now charge $ 15 a night for parking , which is ridiculous in that area of town . for that , i 'd much rather stay closer to the campus areas and walk . it used to be free , and was a great convenience . 2 ) as a gold member , i was given a hard time about my late checkout request because there was a wedding party that had already requested it i did n't realize this was how the priority worked at that hotel ... 3 ) when i turned over the comforter ( on my 2nd night - not sure why i did n't notice the 1st night ) there was a giant coffee stain on the sheets . hopefully the new ownership will step up and bring this hotel back to where it was when it first opened .
1	it 's true that edinburgh has more than its fair share of 'modern european ' eateries . and there 's no denying that this is yet another one to add to the list . but the plus side of this is that the competition among them means that the good ones are usually extremely good . iris is the newest addition to this collection on thistle street . although their \u00c1 la carte is a little too expensive for what it 's worth ( hence only 4 stars and not 5 ) , their set lunch menu offers great value for money . i 'd highly recommend their mussel starter - it comes with toaste pine nuts , bacon and fresh basil cream . it 'll have you racking up the hours in the gym in the days that follow , but it 's so worth it !
0	love this place for a quick mexican fix . their `` rami burrito '' is really good ! carne asada burrito is really salty . hubby loves their menudo .
1	fantastic ! the food and service are superior to most restaurants in the area . i also really loved the ambiance of the restaurant , smaller rooms , romantic and quaint to celebrate a special occasion . what also stood out is we had the table as long as we wanted it . this is n't a restaurant that double books so you can take your time & savor the experience . finally , order the beggar 's purse , it 's outrageously good !
1	brand new del taco location up in centennial hills just off 95 and durango . open 24-hours like other locations . pretty good service and consistent food , always know what to expect from del taco . this location is often not quite as busy as the one in centennial center , nice to have an option .
1	i live in la . but i used to live in las vegas . the red salsa here is the best in the world , my wife and i visit vegas just to take the salsa home ! the food is simple , clean and perfect ! the atmosphere has n't changed in 40 years . it is the perfect hole-in-the-wall restaurant . theresa is the timeless hostess . and juan is the kink of mexican cooking . they have never sought to expand or commercialize ... and they are authentic !
1	we come here whenever were in vegas . which is about once a month . this is our church home away from home . nothing but the best way to praise and worship the lord . heart , soul , and spirit mixed into one and you will crave for more . messages are short and simple but retentive and digs your heart to the core .
0	the food is a tad better than okay . the service is somewhat mixed , it depends who you get for the evening . some are more motivated than others . the manager , summer : - ) , is awesome . ask her if you need anything or have tips for her to inspire you to come again . when i do a food business , i will want her on my team . we love the free wifi . a must for any locale these days . the bear is great . love the micro brews . a note in general : somebody get a grip on the fish prices in arizona please . the only healthy omega3 and protein source we all need , instead , yes yummy but unhealthy quesadillas are cheap . something 's wrong here . most locations throughout the valley still do n't take enough advantage of the promotional built in coupons yelp has to offer to attract new and keep old customers . the five different music styles running non stop in the desert ridge outside area mixed with every store 's individual out put is nerve wrecking . a few big plants and bushes along the iron fence would create a more natural and soothing setting . atmosphere is half the rent .
0	if i can give a zero star , i would . so first of all , this restaurant charges 50cents extra for asking 'no ice ' in their drinks . are you serious ? ! that was a first strike . second : when we just finished eating , the lady at the counter rudely brought us our bill ... did they want to kick us out or something ? i looked around and saw that 80 % of the tables/seats were empty . so why the rush ? third and last strike : when the cashier girl ( who was also eating during her work ) told us that there 's a minimum of $ 20 for using the credit card . again , are you serious .. most of the places are set to $ 10 .. why be greedy and add extra $ 10 into their minimum credit card charge amount ? to sum it up : food was good , but i just could not tolerate the way they treat their customers . i will never return .
0	beautiful scenery and landscape . staff was very friendly . hotel room was ok. double sink was nice . carpet was surprisingly dirty . it left your feet black . bathroom door was rotting away at the bottom . the food at r bar was ok. the restaurant prices were high ( standard for a resort ) . however the quality of the food was below average . therefore the quality to price ratio was very low . i was not alone in thinking this because i saw another hotel guest send back his $ 18 salad because as he put it , `` this is not an $ 18 salad . '' lastly , i can understand resort fees , however , when no mention of the fee is made at check-in and it just appears on your bill with no explanation , the fee is annoying .
1	always friendly , and the crust is so fresh .
0	my husband and i made reservations at this hotel through our timeshare and as soon as we get off the plane we rented a car because clearly we were nowhere near the strip.but as soon as we get there and tried to check in we were advised that they are no rooms available ( booked they said ) and mind you we confirmed the reservation twice . no one called to advise us of anything even though again we confirmed twice.the whole purpose of us renting a car was because we were staying so far from the strip so we had to spend money unnecessarily ( deposit for car rental ) . they advised us we were staying right on the strip . never again .
0	the worst service they attended the anglo first i was there with the family and the customers that were eating were starring at us and talking shit behind our backs so uncomfortable never going to this place again first and last
1	finally got to check the place out today . it was a nice evening out after a spa date , so i came in the place with a good mood . and i was happy as they did keep the good mood going through out . i have had their roast beef and shrimp tempura and they are amazing . i will tell folks that skip their baked potato and opt for fries or mashed potatoes instead . the beef is undeniably juicy , and cooked to perfection to your liking . they have a great wine and cocktail selection too . the environment itself is pretty manly as a taverne can get , so dont expect to hold bachelerottes or fun bridal showers . theres huge tv screens out so its great tobe out here with a pitcher with friends to watch a game and chat over . the staff is super firendly and great . we always have this lady whenever we go there by luck , and are always served by her . she is extremely polite and you can tell that she has a lot of experience and are in good hands right away . overall this is really a must visit place for all meat lovers and for people to hang out at a local place instead of the chain sportbars in downtown . location wise its superfast to get here as its minutes away from the highway and right off the exit . theres also the charlevoix metro away within 2 minutes of walking distance .
1	rochelle 's is incredible . they are an upscale salon and you walk out feeling wonderful about yourself and like you just spent 2 hours with girlfriends . the stylist are all very friendly and warm . rochelle is a-ma-zing with color . she is just incredible . they offer an array of serivces for hair , nails , and body , all reasonably priced . perfect salon !
0	warning : douche bag level code red ! here 's how my experience went ... me : `` may i have a carmel latte ? '' employee : `` no '' .... dead air ... me : `` ummm why not ? '' employee : `` we do n't have carmel '' me : `` ummm i guess i 'll just have a cappuccino then '' employee : `` just so you know it 's a real cappuccino '' me : `` okay '' ( in my head i 'm trying to figure out if i can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not ) . so i sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he 'll be moving to downtown phoenix soon . to which i just chuckled to myself as this person was far from cool enough to blend into cenpho . what a complete and utter douche bag . stay in tempe poser ( and keep your employer there to ! ) . this experience was months ago , and now they have opened up a shop downtown . guess what ? i 'm not going to check them out . fuck you cartel . you 'll never be lux , so just stay in tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you have n't earned . complete fail . for my two cents , skip this place and go to lux in cenpho/mid town right off the light rail . authentically cool with zero attitude , great coffee and no douche bag employees . and as for great coffee ... try conspire way better coffee and authenticly cool . -- -- please read `` owners comment '' below ... here 's my response ... -- -- wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... i guess my new job should be to `` promote good coffee in arizona '' ... and i do n't appreciate good coffee because i enjoy the combination of caramel and coffee ... by that definition i guess i do n't know good ice cream because i like hot fudge on it or good pizza because i enjoy pepperoni and cheese or good music if it 's not acoustic or a good voice unless it 's a cappella ... thanks for proving my point . i would n't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... ( i guess ) they do n't need your business you poser !
1	i live in maricopa and after searching on yelp , called a local plumber thinking they would be less expensive . however , they wanted $ 95 for a trip charge , even though they are located less than a mile away ! so i called hans philipp plumbing because the reviews here are really good . and they did not disappoint ! david came to our house to fix a leak under our kitchen sink and install a new r.o system . he did a great job and was thorough . he was very pleasant and friendly too . i will definitely use them again ! and they only charged $ 45 to come all the way to maricopa !
0	the crowd is majority after club crowd . they come in party clothes and at least semi drunk . food is alright . i have to admit i didnt have their pho but some chinese dish like wonton soup ( in vietnamese style ) fried clams and somw vegetable dish . its not memorable and particularly good . the clams are frozen clams that remained the froze taste . dont think i will go back again .
0	it 's kind of divey but the buffalo wings are amazing , i recommend the good ol irish experience
1	seasons 52 was our choice for a birthday dinner and we had a lovely evening . the food was delicious and the service very good . for the appetiser we tried the flatbread , chicken skewers and stuffed mushroom . all were very good but the flatbread was my favorite . for the main course we ordered the lamb chops , filet mignon , the fish , shrimp pasta . everyone loved their entrees and the portion size was just right . for desert , you get to choose from an array of mini samplers . since i was so full , i settled for fruit . hopefully will try something next time . yes , there will be a next time also because i want to know what the menu in the other seasons looks like ( and also my way to pretend that we actually have 4 seasons in phoenix ! )
0	i ventured over to newk 's around11:45 and after ordering waited 20-25 minutes for my soup and half sandwich to go . although the place was busy , the to-go orders seem to be put to the side . there were gentlemen next to be whom said they had been waiting 30 minutes . someone what disappointing when you hoping to grab a quick lunch to get back to work . as for the food , i ordered the 1/2 turkey and swiss and brocooli cheese soup . the sandwich was great , a toasted roll with melted cheese and all the fixings . however , the soup tasted like it was out of a can . i like cheese , but this was heavy cheese that tasted so ugh . i stick with panera when it comes to broccoli & cheese soup !
1	awesome gym , always clean and amazing coaches ! the coaches are all super helpful and patient . will let you know when you 're doing something wrong or right , form is everything ! not only are the coaches great but all the members are positive and encouraging towards one another .
0	saturday night of memorial day weekend was horrible ! ! we had to wait in line for about 30-45 minutes . then right as we enter we were directed up several flights of stairs to tao beach . uhhhh we did n't want to go here , we wanted the club ! we go straight to the bar and it 's complete madness and so with the dance floor . we manage to find the way downstairs and there 's a line for that too ! most of the time there we stayed in the smaller room playing more hip hop . the dj was the worst ever ! he would start playing a hook to one song then right as we were starting to get into the groove of things he would change it to a different song . seriously ? ! you 're really going to just play only like 10 seconds of a song ? ? we tried to go into the main room but that was just a disaster and ended up back in the smaller room . this was my second time at this club and i remember it being pretty crowded but this was waaayy out of hand . i 'm sure they were way over the capacity . you can guarantee i 'm never coming back here !
0	fresh cleaners was ok , but the customer service was really lacking . the young woman at the desk seemed a little unsure and did n't really seem to understand ( or maybe did n't know how to explain ) their cleaning process when it comes to delicate items . i felt good about going here because of the `` green '' cleaning method , but the customer service was a let down . plus , when i got one of my tops home , a thread had come loose on the cuff . and the fibers seemed very worn , like it had been brushed .
0	i love the hotel , naturally , i liked the cafe . my friends had the cubano sandwich ( they liked it ) , i had the brie , tomato , and bacon panini with tomato soup . the tomato soup was perfectly seasoned and one of the best i 've had . the truffle fries were also awesome and i did n't leave any on the plate . the portions were huge for the price . the only thing lacking was the service . the hostess freaked when we told her there were 12 of us ( even though we were willing to split up ) . she looked annoyed and upset when she sat us . our waitress was not attentive and when we flagged down other waiters to ask for to-go boxes or water they looked annoyed that they had to help us . i 'd go back for the food but know to expect blah service .
0	iv been coming here on and off for a couple of years so that should tell you what kind of a restaurant it is , you would n't come out of your way to come here but if you happen to be closer by and are craving some arabic/med/greek food then this place is pretty good . portions are a bit on the small side , which is unusual for the kind of restaurant that it is . what pisses me off is that the do n't have unlimited lamb shanks in their buffet anymore , which kinda defeats the purpose of a buffet . now you can only get one per buffet , and it was the only thing that you could convince your brain to cough up 10 something bucks for the other things are ehh . you 're better off ordering something from their menu , the things on there are actually good .
1	it was year 2003 in vegas with a couple friends stayed at this hotel . they ended up giving us the celebrity suite for the whole time and it was awesome . we paid the normal price of a regular room , hotel treated us very well . there was really nothing to complain about except the fact i did n't get the chance to use our own gym in our suite . the place outside does look outdated but our whole entire suite was clean and modern . shower was all glass , granite bathroom , jacuzzi bathtub was huge . bed was comfortable . that was important .
0	i must say this is another of the numerous times that i am disappointed with the customer service in montreal , but this time it was not only disappointing but also kind of insulting . we went with the groupon offer to experience the tapas tasting menu . i must say that the food is okay , but my reason for the 1 star review was the poor service we experienced . i have been in the restaurant business for 20 years and i understand how sometimes one single employee can ruin the reputation of a restaurant , and it should n't be that way . i write this review with the hope that the people that run the restaurant read it and acknowledge that the staff should treat the customers as their one and only priority , and that good customer service is the best way to get new referrals that will help grow the business . montreal is a multicultural city and therefore , what a entree means to one culture could mean different to another culture . when i asked for the beef tartare , i had no idea it was made of raw meat , since in my country it is cooked . when i asked the waiter if he could change it since i had no clue it was raw , he just looked at me with a bad expression and said `` somebody has got to pay for that '' in a very rude way . i had not even tried the tartare ; i just asked if it could be exchanged . then , when i asked if it could be cooked a little bit at least , he again gave me that same negative look and did not handle the situation with care and patience . when my boyfriend decided to eat it and try it , i assumed that was going to be the end of it , but it was not . the waiter stopped by again trying to blame us for our mistake , naturally making fun of us . he asked me if i wanted to see the menu again and i just said no . i did not even want to look at the guy . i had never been treated like that anywhere else . when he came with the bill , we saw the $ 4 dollars that we had to pay for the taxes , which was perfectly fine , but then underneath the total amount , there was this other handwritten amount ( about $ 9 ) . when we asked what that was for he said it was for `` the service '' . i was really in shock and just wanted to leave that place . since when do restaurants in montreal add a handwritten and compulsory service fee to the bills ? my boyfriend literally laughed out loud when he saw that . we paid and just left the place . we went to another restaurant and spent $ 50 in food that we could have easily spent at cielo tapas if we had been treated properly . i hope the service here changes and that customers get treated with respect . in the meantime , i just do not recommend the place , merely for the bad service that waiter provided .
1	not bad ! i mean , the wait was short when i went for lunch and the selection of food was endless ! if it were n't for our lazy waitress , the experience would have been excellent . the good : - wide selection of food ! ! ! - tepanyaki - soup station at the chinese food section - some desserts , such as the red velvet cake the bad : - orange juice tastes like water - lack of fruits - gelato , which tastes nothing like gelato `` gelato '' flavors : vanilla yogurt , chocolate , strawberry sherbert , coconut , tiramisu , orange , mango sherbert , and sugar-free chocolate . i tried all the flavors and i 'd say the coconut was the best and the strawberry was the worst !
0	the food here was really good , but we experienced some of the most obnoxious service i 've ever encountered . he basically `` upsold '' us at every opportunity -- asking whether we wanted `` seafood towers for the table '' while we placed our orders , and offering to add something to everything we ordered ( `` that green salad is great with crab ..... you should get foie gras on that steak '' ) . the worst was when he suggested `` a bunch of double sides for the table '' ( why we needed mac and cheese and mashed potatoes when everyone was ordering sushi and crab , i have no idea ) -- -- we ignored the suggestion , and he brought them anyway , which probably added $ 80 to our bill . we are huge fans of rick moonens and were excited to eat here , but we left this place feeling swindled . really a bummer .
1	the peppermill is my new mandatory stop when in vegas . the fireside lounge is really cool , ( kinda looks like a porn set shoot ! ) , purple & pink neon lighting , round couch area to sit back and enjoy a cocktail . over the top vegas style , nice ! the hi lite of the lounge is the water feature with flames emanating from the middle surrounded by a circular set of couches to kick back on . our group rolled in to get a bloody mary . spicy yes , lots of good vodka , yes , big stalk of celery , cucumber slice sidecar on the goblet , cherry tomato impaled on a plastic toothpick-very tasty indeed . we saw another group who ordered scorpions , a massive 1/2 gallon goblet filled with rum and stuff ; 24 '' straw included . food wise , at breakfast , i ended up going big , ny steak & eggs , perfect med rare cooked seasoned slab of cow , perfect scrambled eggs contained in a ramekin , killer hash browns , coffee was eh , but who cares . good service , a bit more $ than other places , but i 'll gladly pay more for the good stuff . peppermill , ambiance , good food , strong drink , what 's not to like ! ! we 'll be back ! !
1	do n't pay attention to the snob reviewers . no , it 's not the best steak in phoenix . if you have to have the best of everything everywhere you go then that says all we need to know about you . if it 's busy , you 're going to wait . we call that `` science '' . i really liked my steaks each time i have eaten here . last trip i spotted someone eating some really good looking ribs . i 'll have to try those next time . come for a decent steak , a good meal , interesting atmosphere and a great view at night .
1	last year , i went to vegas for a week due to my hubby 's conference there ; after i checked at yelp , ( before we left ) , we tried mon ami gibi for brunch .... wow ! their waffle was so .... yummy ! so last week ( june ,2012 ) , i went with my hubby to vegas again ( the same reason there ) , we put on our schedule to have a brunch there again .... still , we both loved their waffle . so far , i have n't found any better place for waffle in san francisco than mon ami gibi . went to mon ami gibi for breakfast last
1	its a chipotle . ya get what you expect . the kids love it . wifey can eat healthy there . i do n't really consider chipotle to be very good as a mexican cuisine , but for what they serve , its darn tasty . love their chips , and their guac . and their pork is excellent , too . not saying this specific location was , but be sure to watch when they are dishing the protein ; sometimes they ca be skimpy on the meat , especially if the line is long .
1	omg ! the yellow chicken curry is fantastic . i moved here from los angeles in february and have searched around for the right place to buy awesome thai food and i am so glad i found it on the first shot . the food here reminds me of the great tastes you can find in california .
0	prices high , food great , but i ca n't afford this .
0	worst customer service ever . the staff is so rude . i was told to pick up my pizza in 20 minutes , i sat in the place for a full hour before i got my pizza and wings and my wing order was wrong . even though the container said hot they were most definitely bbq . while sitting in the building waiting you could tell the place suffered from horrible management . the staff was yelling at each other , screaming that they were out of boneless wings and having to call people back and see what else they wanted instead . not to mention the woman who was running the counter was flat out rude . she did n't apologize for making is wait so long and did n't care that the wings were cold but the pizza was hot . i will most definitely never go there again ever .
0	not sure what everyone sees in these pies . not worth the money .
0	honestly this place is overhyped . i got andy 's sage fried chicken with mashed potatoes , eggs , biscuit , and bacon . my food had no flavor whatsoever . i do n't like my food too salty but this was just too bland . the only thing i probably finished was the bacon and biscuit lol . the wait service is excellent the food is just not up my alley .
0	i cant really say that i would recommend seeing a performance at ovens auditorium . compared to the belk theatre and some of the other theatre around town it really doesnt compare . you can really expect a high school auditorium feel at ovens . the seats are old , not very comforable seats and when we went it was super hot inside . with that many people in one building they really need to get better ventilation and air conditioning . i have a very bad back and i can not go to many places because of the discomfort with the seating and this is one of those places i could not go back to . ovens has had a lack of big performances within the last couple of years , and the prices were about the same as belk theatre so it doesnt make any sense to go to ovens .
0	nice , but small display . it was fun , but thought it would be a little bigger and more interactive
0	fantastic service , super friendly staff . the rooms could use a cosmetic update . there was quite a bit of construction going on during our stay and we had to walk thru the work to access our room . the area should have been closed off . like most resorts everything is pricey . we enjoyed two days at the mother of pearl pool with fantastic service and drinks . three stars because of updates needed , construction zones , pricey .
0	do not stay here ! ! ! ! i do n't care if you 're broke as hell , sleep in your car ! this place was such a dump . they tried to charge an early check in fee , which no hotel in vegas ever has ( i go at least twice a year ) . then i was charged a resort fee . how dare they charge any fees for this place . they are under construction , they do n't have a pool , and only 2 restaurants in the casino , which both sucked . no starbucks , no quick food ... nothing . so i get my wifi password and later come to find it 's only good for one device , which no one told me . i called the manager , she said that 's the rules , and the resort fees are done by every hotel . i said every hotel is n't a dump and at least has a pool . she wad rude and unapologetic . so i get up to my floor and the entire carpeting is duct taped , walls are filthy , and wall paper is coming off . ice machine was broken and instead of them telling me they 'll send someone up , they told me to go to another floor to get ice . ok ... then i get in my room which was decorated by one of the golden girls . there were seminal fluids along with cigarette burns in the drapes ( on my non smoking floor ) , the shower had a black ring around it because when you shower the water does n't drain and i had to shower with my sandals on . i slept in sheets which i saw in the morning as i went to make the bed , were covered in period stains that my daughter and i both slept in . i complained , no apology , just sent me new sheets and never took the blood stained ones . there were a couple other things that i wo n't mention because i called the health department on them and would rather have them penalized for it then having them fix it . do n't be fooled by the pictures , they are not for that hotel . i called travelocity and complained and they graciously computed my for my next vacation which will never be remotely close to the quad .
0	a review for their mani/pedi . huge disappointment . you would think a name like canyon ranch spa at the venetian would provide top notch quality for their mani/pedis but boy was i in for a surprise . first the mani/pedis are done in the salon on the palazzo side - which meant i had to walk really far from the venetian to get to my appointment . i got there on time and they made me wait for over 10 minutes . i was already irked because i have a limited amount of time in vegas and that precious time should be not be spent waiting . the whole vibe felt like i was in a busy grocery store . it was so loud in there and too many people bustling around . i thought i would be able to relax at the `` spa '' but it was so noisy and my technician was kind of weird . she was awkward to talk to so i just gave up and stared over her shoulder while she did my nails . before we started she asked me to soak my fingers and the water was boiling hot ! i asked her to add some cold water in and she said `` oh no it 's ok it 's just something for you to do while i get ready '' . um ok , i just scald my fingers and you do n't even apologize ? ? she filed my nails into a decent shape but her painting skills definitely lacked . my nails looked so goopy and thick afterward . she tried to clean the polish on my finger and cuticle by dipping a brush into nail polish remover . i 've seen this done before but her technique was n't really good and she left my nails with dual layers like she could n't really paint my nails correctly . to top it off , she messed up my thumb . instead of starting over ( which she should have ) she just dipped her finger into nail polish remover and tried to smooth it out . it was so obvious and ugly ! she was definitely rushing to get me to my pedicure appointment because she was so behind and loopy . the pedicure was just ok. they had the spa whirlpool chairs which i do n't like because i 'm paranoid of germs . there was nothing special to the pedicure . the guy ( yes a dude and i 'm sorry but i really do n't like men giving me pedicures . it just creeps me out ) pumiced the bottom of my feet so much that by night time i felt the soles of my feet hurting . i think he may have overdid it . my toe nails chipped after 1 day . finger nail polish stayed in tack for almost a week . i did go back to talk to someone about the lack of quality of the services but all they offered was to redo my nails and toes . i really did n't have the time or patience to go through it again . worst $ 150 i ever spent on myself ! yes it cost big bucks and it sucked ! ( 1 star bonus for letting me keep the nail polish )
0	the only reason i give this 2 stars is because the food was pretty good . now the bad . first my friend and i sat at the bar to get something to eat , sat there about ten minutes , the bartender did n't even look at us . but we were there so we just opted to get a table instead . it was about 10:50 and we wanted lunch food . wrong . lunch there , for whatever reason , does n't start until 11:00 on the dot . what 's up with that ? ? ? and also once we got a table , it took a while to have a waitress come over to take our order . i will not be going there again .
0	these cupcakes look stunning ! in fact they look so good they make you think they even taste better then they do ! i 've been to bibi 's 3 times now . i 'm not quite sure why . maybe its been the people i was with ( different each time ) or the fact that all those times happened in the first 6 months of living here in scotland and i was just drawn in by the beauty of the cupcakes ... but lets break it down . they icing taste more like harden lard with sugar . its not delicious , its not smooth , the texture is hard and i do not want to eat all of it ( which is ridiculous b/c i get icing shots at a cupcake place in ca . i love my icing ! ) next the cake ... i know its scotland and people like their cake her dry and crumbly , but listen theres no pouring cream for the cupcakes so make mine moist ! too dry or too dense . the only one i had which i would get again if i had to go back , would be the victoria sponge cupcake . the icing was better then the others ( probably b/c it was inside and not decorative ) but still just meh , nothing to rave about . sad b/c i like a good cupcake , but this is not the place for it yet there seems to be so many bibi 's around and i ca n't figure out why ! ?
0	we came here a year ago and everything was surprisingly good . i returned last week , and everything was surprisingly bad ! she had the combo deal with chicken , brisket , and pork ribs . i had the smoked salmon . the chicken was awful - soggy skin , and the brisket was a disaster - tough as anything . ribs were not bad . my smoked salmon was really not that good at all .
0	first time here . i 'll give credit where it 's due , they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous . i had 2 bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork . while eating my sandwiches i had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq . boiled meat covered in bbq sauce is not bbq . i grew up in the south , i 've been to memphis in may a couple of times , so my standards for bbq are admittedly higher than average , but this was not even close to real bbq . was it decent food . sure . decent , at best . was it the reason i got an upset stomach a couple hours later , possibly . i do n't care about the old decor , dirty looking bathrooms or anything else , if the food was good i would go back . it was n't .
1	authentic ! ! having spent 20 years in the middle east , i 've always been on the lookout for great middle eastern fare , and zeitouni gets it pretty right ! we ordered the falafel platter , shish tawooq , and shish kabob platters - and everything was very very good ! freshly made , great taste , fine texture - much more than what you 'd expect when you 're not in dubai ! the ambience is n't great - more like a middle eastern mcdonalds , the service tends to the slower side , but the food pretty much compensates for it all ! do go there if you want a quick bite - you wo n't be disappointed !
1	university animal hospital has provided the best care for our fur kids ! the compassion , knowledge , and expertise that both dr. ware and dr. koch have shown in caring for our girls is amazing . i would n't trust anyone else in caring for our pups !
0	if you 're stuck on mill and you want some coffee really bad , they 've got some really bad coffee for you . honestly , coffee plantation is n't on my top 20 best cups of coffee , but it 's one of only a few places where you can get a latte near campus . it 's not very cheap and the barista range from friendly to hipper-than-thou art school drop outs . nonetheless , it is a coffee shop , they do make espresso drinks , and there is some good people watching to be had . wifi 's free- you can pay to use their computers if you 're technologically disadvantaged though .
0	their green tea smoothie is good and they are my go to coffee place if i want something really strong to wake me up .
0	my bff loves pootin . oh yes he does . fancy or dirty , he 'll gobble it up . so i thought it best i share this thing i heard . see , there 's this rumour , and like all great rumours it stuck . whether it be true or not is up to the individual . seeing as this is my blog , ergo i am the individual , i am here to call the rumour false . they say la banquise is one of the best , if not best places for poutine . that statement is false . la banquise serves poutine 24 hours a day . that statement is true . this diner is a favourite for many , likely because of that , and not because they serve the best . their poutine is okay . there are many , many , many choices , and that in and of itself is great . you can have poutine with merguez sausage , with smoked meat , with turkey and peas , etc . basically , you can get it with a whole lot of something or with nothing at all . your choice . after a long day of shopping i wanted a snack so i got myself the elvis : beef , mushrooms and green peppers . i ate it all , but do n't i always . it was good but frite alors is still my favourite . nobody messes with me and my frites .
1	the food was so good that i do n't want to brush my teeth for a month at the off chance a fleck of meat might drop on my tongue
0	service was very slow but the food was quite good .
1	just had lunch at the old scottsdale location . we had skinny margaritas , short rib tacos and the serrano shrimp salad . the food was outstanding and the service was very good . highly recommend this spot for lunch . we will definitely come back !
0	this may be the girliest review i will ever write . do n't lapse into shock now , but occasionally i get mani-pedis . mainly because i 'm too lazy to take care of my own nails . ah , yes . now you 're all back with me . i 've waited to write this review because my experiences at nail candy have been all over the map . after a handful of manicures ( ha ! get it ? whatever . ) and pedicures , it 's about time i wrote something . the best way to go about it is with a simple pros and cons list . pros : it 's a `` cute '' atmosphere . if you like that sort of thing . lots and lots of pink . e ! on all the tvs . it seems like a nice place to have a girl 's birthday party , and they do offer this service . monica is one of the best manicurists in the pittsburgh . she may be sarcastic and perhaps even a tad misanthropic , but she sure as hell knows what she 's doing . i saw her paint some very intricate designs on a very demanding customer 's toes . if nail candy was full of monicas , i would give it a much higher rating . yes , they have massage chairs . but i must note that this is becoming a bit of a staple in nail salons . many of my friends expect them whenever and wherever they get pedicures . still , they have a nice little disney princess pedicure chair for children . cons : nail candy is understaffed , and the people they do have tend to be clumsy and ill-experienced . i 've had polish and gel dripped all over my hands . not a big deal in the grand scheme of things , but not very professional , either . the manicures that were not performed by monica came out very sloppy . if i had more money , i probably would have paid to have them re-done right away . nail candy does n't ( ca n't ? ) take many walk-ins . i highly recommend making an appointment . with monica . over the years , it seems that nail candy has gone down in customer service and quality , but the prices have remained the same . i will most likely avoid it until they make some improvements .
1	this place is amazing ! ! ! beth , the owner , has the best taste in clothes ! i saw a very cute skirt pictured on the store 's facebook page , i told them i 'd really like to have one & it was sent to me on anchorage ak for on $ 5 shipping cost . it arrived 5 days later . could n't be happier .
1	i think this place is great , although a lot of the time the staff consists of bratty high school kids who act annoyed that they have to help you .
0	not impressed with this place . the view was gorgeous but i 've had better fajitas at chili 's ! the busser was on top of it , but the waiter was a little weird . the horchata was about the only thing that i can say was really good , which is sad because i 've heard so many good things about this place . we probably wo n't be going back , if it was n't for the ambiance .
0	finally stayed here and wasnt impressed . i thought i liked the bed . it was pretty soft . so pull back the sheets to look at the mattress to see what kind it is what do i see , period stains . i was totally disgusted . i had highier expectations of this place . i checked in on face book and got a free drink at the bar , that was cool . the rooftop club is cool . the hotel room was a good size . but i probably wouldnt stay here again . the room was also far from the parking which i hate . this place is big too , easy to get lost .
0	even though thie might not be something really extraordinary in a city where extraordinary is the norm but i still think you shouldnt miss this place if your visiting ( like who really lives in vegas , right ? he he ) . this place is about a 10 min cabride from `` the strip '' and is often refered to as `` old vegas '' where the first old casionos where back in the ( ok flamingo excluded ) . you have binions and golden nugget and such old school casino hotels as well as the famous vegas vic cowboy who used to wave his hands to the visitors of las vegas . today you have a roof over freemont str wich is also a huge screen where you can see music videos or other fun things depending on what time you are there . its lots of people , restaurants and bars as it is on the strip just a bit different . my inside tip if your in the area and suddenly feel the urge to eat a fantastic steak in an mens cigarr club kind of a setting : vic & anthonys inside the golden nugget . best steak in vegas with nice ambiance and great servers . bring your big wallet though because quality come with a price tag .
0	my friends from law school and i went here saturday night to celebrate 2 of our party getting engaged . it was by far the absolute worst , most bizarre , and offensive dining experience i 've ever had . there were 9 of us and we had a reservation for 8. we arrived about 5-6 minutes late ( which i thought was pretty good for such a large party ) and waited in the foyer of the tiny place for a hostess . then , i saw the hostess complaining that we were late and rudely call me at 8:07 to ask if we were coming . i waved and said we 'd been there . did she not notice the large group by the door ? when we were seated our waiter again remarked that they were waiting for us . seriously ? 5 minutes ? relax . terrible way to start a celebration dinner . one of my friends told our waiter it would be easier to split our bills by couple so he could put in the orders that way and he responded , `` this is n't mcdonalds . this is a french restaurant . '' he awkwardly and rudely pressured the future-groom to pay for the entire table . he then ignored the wine we chose and brought a different one , telling us it was better . also , he told us he would bring champagne for a toast for our friends which never happened . he then intrusively and impatiently stood in front of us waiting for us to order , pressuring us to order quickly . after putting in our orders , we did not see our waiter for quite seriously over an hour . attentive bus boys refilled our water and ( mediocre ) bread and dropped off salads . we were out of drinks for 45 minutes and would have ordered at least 2 more bottles of wine had he been present . our food arrived about an hour and 15 minutes after we ordered it , which was ridiculous even for a large party in a small restaurant . my dinner did not arrive and a bus boy actually asked me if i had ordered dinner . our waiter then came over and started yelling at the chefs ( the kitchen was about 2 feet behind us ) and the chefs told him he did not put in my order . he then took a different table 's order and gave it to me and yelled at the bus boys for not giving it to me . some of my friends enjoyed their food , some hated it , mine was average at best ( for $ 30 a plate , this is n't exactly ideal ) . both tables next to us complained about their food and were comped wine/desserts . we were given no compensation . probably the worst part was at the end when he handed us one sheet of paper without a tab added up ( it was just the items and prices ) . we again told him we would be splitting the bill and he said , `` you ca n't really be doing this to me '' and again told us it was a french restaurant and we were all one table and should have one bill . i then quite plainly told him to understand that one person was not picking up the whole meal , so he gave us paper and a calculator and sat next to my friend as she tallied everyone 's bill . he did nothing but hover and frequently remind us not to forget to add tip . he treated us as if we had never been out before and we were low-class or cheap . it was incredibly bizarre and offensive . he actually got in a bit of a heated talk with the future-bride when she asked him why it was such a problem to split the checks initially when it was n't like he put them into a computer or even did any of the math himself . it was as if were were in a scene in a comedy or on some sort of show . why would a restaurant treat the young professionals in shadyside who dine out frequently so poorly ? never go here . comically terrible service ( ca n't even find the words to describe it ) and average food . go to casbah , plum , salt , spoon , any of the places around there . unreal . we dine out all the time and have never had anything even close to this ever happen to us . we were trying to celebrate a happy occasion and instead were dumbfounded and angry and treated horribly .
0	just had my car washed here for the first time . the person who checked me in and the cashier were both very friendly . they did try to sell me the chip repair as other reviews have mentioned - they are very sneaky and say `` it wo n't cost you a thing ... we just need your insurance card . '' but a simple `` no thank you '' and they leave it alone i am used to `` hand '' car washes that run the car through a machine and just hand dry it , so i went to remove my rear antenna ( it does not retract ) and they said it would be fine since they do n't use machines . that 's nice i got the `` ultimate '' wash because on thursdays they give ladies 30 % off , so it was $ 21 + tip . looks clean enough to me . they did wipe out the junk tray and cup holders . this whole time i thought my dash was grey but it turns out it 's actually black and was just super filthy . my view while driving is really different now ! they did miss quite a bit of the `` gunk '' ( protein shake ? coffee ? dog barf ? who knows ? ) on my passenger seat . i was able to get it off with a lysol wipe but the whole point of having my car washed is not having to do it myself . overall not bad for $ 20ish bucks
0	horrible place ... i believe i saw linda macconnell . i was also put in a room and waited and waited , someone from the staff opened the door and said i was put in the wrong room . dr macconnell laughed at the reason why i was there , did n't give the medication i needed . i now i have er bills thxs to her and a month and half has gone by based on her bogus findings . $ 45 to lie on a table and fall backwards to see my reflexes for 2 minutes , what a joke .
1	we were very impressed . i 've never seen so many dr 's . taking care of one patient . although my husband had a lot going on , it still amazed us . the care was excellent . the nursing staff was above reproach and took care of every need my husband had and even mine . they set it up so i could sleep right next to my husband in a somewhat cozy recliner with blankets & pillows . it was clean and sanitary . we 've never had such attentiveness and compassion as my husband did at good sam .
0	health plan of nv referred me to this `` factory '' as they give you no other choices . first thing : xrays . got the xrays , was told they did n't reveal enough , i needed an mri . spent $ 500 out of my own pocket for an mri . then ? i 'm not lying : they told me they needed another mri with the iodine leak . $ 600 ! and , my dr. even lost his temper with me on the last visit , how professional ! frustrated , i drove straight down to tijuana and saw an orthopedist there , who merely laughed at me ! he used to be a dr. in the u.s. , now back in mexico , and he told me that dr. 's in the u.s. have a vested interest in x-ray `` factories '' , and some cases , they own them ! thus : xrays , mri 's endlessly ! the dr. also told me , for a baker 's cyst , in all his years , he 's never ordered an mri for a baker 's cyst , and ironically , my nv dr. 's name was baker ! for the price of my copay ( $ 60 ) , my mexican dr. poured over all my xrays , even the ultrasound cd , consulted with me for 45 minutes , even touched my body , and i paid $ 60 ! he did more for me than anyone up here , but not the first time , i 've run to tijuana 2x before when i ran into these type of `` roadblocks '' . hooray , hooray , for medical tourism !
1	i had a chorizo and egg burrito , my friend had a carne asada burrito , and i had a medium drink , and it was all less than $ 10 . that alone makes me like this place . the fact that the burrito was pretty good sized , and extremely tasty , makes me love this place ! it 's not in my neck of the woods , but i may be training in the area for another week . if so , i intend to stop in and try the nachos .
0	i am torn on this place . i really like the visit i had , yet none of the food particularly did much for me . it was quality grub , and seemed very close to being great , but it just fell short . i plan on going back , as i think that i possibly just ordered the wrong items . and it will be easy to find different dishes , as the menu is extensive . other than the food , the decor was modern , yet comfortable . the service was attentive . and ( the best part ) the draft beers were cheap !
1	i 've been to other smashburger locations . this one is definitely my favorite ! people here are always friendly and helpful , which makes the delicious burgers and fries more enjoyable ! !
0	the injera was paper thin with no flavor . veggie combo was utterly too salty , especially the potato & carrots . beef tibs were ok , but nothing to write home about . edible , but really mediocre food with non-existent service . i might have been really badly spoiled in seattle with really good ethiopian food , but this place was just so disappointing .
1	dear bosa , i * heart * you . i really do . just thinking about your delicious ham & cheese stuffed croissant makes the butterflies in my tummy all sorts of flippy-floppy . i did n't really care for the jalapeno-added variety , but it 's not your fault . i guess i 'm just not as much of a jalapeno lover as i thought i was . but the item on your menu that brings me nothing but unadulterated bliss is your lemon filled donut . so soft and yielding , i just ca n't help myself when i 'm around them . powdered sugar on my face , in my hair , all over my hands and clothes ... it feels just as obscene as it sounds , and i want to continue this dirty romance for many , many years to come . i 'm sure i will try your other options , the tryst i had with your sinful apple fritter was a one ( maybe two-four ) time thing . but i 'll always come back for a sweet surrender to your doughy lemon lumps . * blush *
1	good food , much better than i expected . it is a bar after all so i thought we would have a menu of nothing but fried goodies & finger food but to my great surprise they have a great menu . there was at least one item in each section that i wanted to try . my friend and i split the gobbler sandwich ( turkey , roasted red pepper & provolone cheese on rosemary foccacia ) and a small blt salad . the salad has slices of fresh avocado and a delicious ranch dressing . the portion sizes were generous so even though we split both the sami & salad we were both full . beers were n't cheap at $ 5 each but the selection was huge . i am not a beer snob so i ordered bud light and $ 5 is steep in my opinion . anyway , after 2 beers the sandwich & salad our bill was just over $ 30 . table service sucked so we ordered our meal & paid our bill at the bar .
0	fantastic patio area ..... as long as the weather is good ! friendly service with your standard starbucks menu .
0	overall assessment : gotcha pricing leaves a bad taste last night was the first time i ordered pizza from villa pizza , and i made the mistake of not having a menu in my possession when ordering . we ordered two large pizzas ( one cheese and one with mushrooms ) , and it was $ 34 . there was a menu taped to one of the boxes , and the menu said that if we had mentioned their `` two pizza special '' when ordering , i would have saved $ 8 . the person on the phone should have mentioned that there was a special . boy do i feel ripped off . while the pizza was good , the gotcha pricing left a bad taste . more than anything , yelpers need to be aware .
0	the buffet of buffets for $ 40 is a good deal for 24hrs of unlimited buffets across 7 different properties , we ate here mainly what you would expect , prime rib , shrimp , crab legs , etc good quality and taste for the $ $
1	i love this place . h is a super friendly person . he knows what he 's doing and takes pride in his work . the wait/ service can be a bit lengthy but the cut is worth the time . his suggestions and opinion is very good . this is favorite barber shop in tempe .
0	the portabello burger is soooo nasty ! yuck ! the only things we get are the thousand bean pitta which is really good and the pesto pizza yummy as well . they have fast service .
0	this place is horrible . i waited more than 30 minutes to the supervisor say me they ca n't help ....
1	this park is huge -- it 's montr\u00e9al 's equivalent of central park in nyc or golden gate park in san francisco . there are massive open spaces and wide , groomed-dirt trails for people to walk , bike , or jog . if you take the trails all the way up to the top , there 's a huge empty building that looks like it could host giant receptions and galas , with a large patio with a great view of the city . there 's a giant pond with paddleboats in the summer , and ice skating in the winter ! plenty of picnic areas , too . it 's definitely a great spot to check out if you are in montr\u00e9al . especially since the park is free ! ( parking costs money , though ) . ohmigod - i just realized that the entire city of montr\u00e9al is named after this place ! !
0	this location closed mid december 2011. they have directed members to the la fitness at university & stapley . la fitness purchased a large number of bally 's , and are closing them/consolidating them to la locations .
0	not very happy , overall quality of service was mediocre . i have n't had a pedicure in months . today was the day i chose to treat myself and splurge the money . front desk receptionist charged the wrong amount to my card . when i asked him to please not run the card twice , he did n't listen and now i have two charges to my account . he apologized but did n't offer any resolution nor copies of my receipt . i now need to take it up with my bank .
0	hmmm . pastabar struck me as oddly pretentious , filling its wine list with choices unrecognizable to the average person and batting about completely foreign italian phrases on the menu . i 'm not a total wine moron , yet i needed the server to translate for me . the safe-bet syrah and cabs were something ridiculous like $ 18 a glass . huh ? luckily , the red i went with was perfectly tasty . vegetarians ? you are shit out of luck here . i 'm not even certain what a vegan would do . the only really vegetarian items on the menu were two noodles and butter dishes , which sounds as interesting as baby food . the twelve-ingredient streetwalker 's pantry dish has anchovies in it , but since its description did n't put me to sleep , i gave it a shot , dead fish and all . the mix of textures with the pasta , sauce , and toasted bread crumbs was good , but the overall flavor simply did n't wow me . and , perhaps i am mistaken , but there were little sweet bits of mystery substance in there also ... raisins ? that 's just trying too hard . my so got the butter and pepper noodles , which did indeed taste like an entire container of black pepper was dumped in the sauce . spicy , but really one-dimensional . he liked it very much , but he tends to choose pure heat over complexity in flavors . the restaurant itself is cute but nothing extraordinary . the server was helpful , but slightly on the used-car-salesman side . bread and butter , like someone else mentioned , does cost extra . wtf is that ? the bread was good , but nothing special . somehow , i kind of resent the idea of pasta dishes without pricey shrimp or fancy meats being expensive . it 's frigging pasta . i do n't care if you make it in house . i just feel ripped off .
0	the service here was the worst i 've ever experienced in las vegas ( lived here 5 yrs now ) . not only did we end up waiting a total of about an hour before we got our food , but people that sat down after we ordered got their salads first . i had all you can eat pasta ( tues night ) $ 7 but they make you buy a $ 3 drink and i got a salad w/ it but my husband bought the gnocchi dish for $ 11 and did n't get a salad ? dumb . they also charged my husband $ 1 for adding a couple of shreds of basil to his dish . my all you can eat plate came out and it was twice the size of his $ 12 dish and he could n't get more . it was terrible ! i had the carbonara sauce and it was okay but super buttery . fyi for the vegetarians , all sides are $ 3 , yes , to add spinach to your dish is the same price as adding chicken . we live right down the street and will not go again .
1	love this nail salon ! i walked in and they took me right away for a pedicure and shellac manicure . i needed a redo from another salon i had a living social deal for . i ended up not saving any money but i found a place i will be coming to for all my nail needs . they use a dremel file to take the calluses off your feet , they feel as soft as a newborn 's ! the manicure lasted 15 days , would have been longer if my nails had n't grown out . they are fast and friendly and very economically priced !
1	everytime my boyfriend and i go to vegas , we make it a goal to stay in a new hotel each time . the flamingo was the very first hotel i stayed at when i went to vegas for my very first time 3 years ago and now , each time we go , even though we 're supposed to be staying at a new place i 'm tempted to get rooms there again . when i made reservations for the flamingo i was a little hesitant based on some of the reviews from yelp . mainly people discussed , the long lines to check in , the cleanliness etc .. let me tell you about my experience .... we arrived at the flamingo in the midst of summer ( july ) where it was at it 's peak tourist time . we arrived about 4 hours early for check in but decided to take a chance at trying to check in anyways . the reviews were right , the line for check in was the longet i 've ever seen , but in all fairness i heard a worker tell a walk-in tourist that their rooms were booked to capacity . when we arrived at the front of the line , the guy at the check-in counter informed us our room was n't ready ( not their fault we were 4 hours early ) . here is where they score major points . rather than making us come back and wait in line again , they gave us a room that was ready and just upgraded us to a room on the 17th floor with a view of the strip at no extra charge ! now for the rooms . make absolute sure that you get one of their recently remodeled `` go rooms . '' very cool . hot pink lights in the bathroom , a tv in the bathroom mirror , curtains that open with the flick of a light switch and the bed ... oh my goodness this was one of the most comfortable beds i 've ever slept in in my entire life . if i had a way of smuggling it out in my suitcase , i probably would have . another plus for the flamingo , it 's located in a really great area of the strip where it 's close to walk to just about anything . most people might get turned off by the fact that this is an older hotel , but it really makes you think of `` the old vegas '' and you practically expect to see the rat pack waltzing in throught the doors . love it !
0	delicious coffee so hot , you wo n't taste it ( or anything else ) . do n't get me wrong , it 's a fine product , illy coffee is one of my favorites ; but here at the illy espressamente shop , they make it just a little hotter than they should . ( ten minutes later and i 'm still burning my tongue trying to get a sip ) . i 'm sure once it cools down a little ( a lot ) it will be delicious . i 'm just not sure i have the patience .
0	i am not a fan of the liberty . i was excited to go and try this place out . i had heard about the extensive beer list , and that was the only aspect of our visit that did not disappoint . they serve a good selection of drafts and bottles as well as wines . i had a great draft cider , 'original sin ' . that was the highlight of our meal . our server misrepresented at least one dish , the vegetable plate , as it had none of what he described . they only have one soup per day , and that changes . all of the food for my table arrived lukewarm , and a lukewarm burger is not good . our server forgot our appetizer order , and then when prompted delivered it after our entrees . the pretzel appetizer was good , but waay overpriced -- $ 6 for 2 small pretzels with mustard . overall , a bad experience . if i got back , it will only be to the bar .
1	i could eat sushi every day but unfortunately the hubby does n't feel the same way . cowfish is the perfect place for us since i can get my sushi fix while he can eat regular american cuisine . whoever came up with this concept is a genius ! the menu at cowfish is very extensive including lots of tempting apps , a huge array of typical ( and atypical ) sushi , burgers , `` normal '' american entrees ( grilled chicken , steak , etc ) , and plenty of milkshakes and other non-ice cream desserts . we started with a free appetizer by becoming a `` cowfish junkie '' online before dinner . all you have to do is enter your email address on their website and they 'll send you coupons . we had the blackened ahi tuna nachos . i thought they were incredible with lots of complementing flavors coming together in a perfect combination . i ordered a double salmon roll and the foreplay roll for dinner . the sushi description says an 8 piece roll is big enough for an entree and i was a little skeptical . turns out , an 8 piece roll was more than enough to fill me up and i had to take 8 pieces home with me . each piece of the roll is huge and hard to fit in your mouth in one bite . i would highly recommend asking for it to be cut into 10 pieces to avoid any awkwardness . both rolls were stuffed with fresh salmon and other ingredients and were delicious ! the sushi was definitely comparable to what you 'd get at a japanese restaurant . the decor was modern cool with all red walls , black ceiling , and bright , colorful pop art on the walls . this place could double as a decent date spot or a cool place to hang with some friends . if you 're cold-natured like me try not to sit next to the large garage-style retractable doors in the winter . it gets a little breezy . our waiter was excellent and he gave good recommendations for each section of the menu . that was quite helpful and practically everything we ordered came from his recommendations . at the end of our meal the manager came over to introduce himself and he gave us 2 more free appetizer coupons ! if i had n't been sold already the extra free stuff would 've won me over for sure .
0	i had a prepaid coupon for dinners at this place which say to redeem at 20165 n 67th dr. i drove out there but they were not at that address . the business there gave me a new address of 8976 w union hills and a phone number which i called to verify . their answering service answered and said they are open 11am to 7pm and they were busy and could n't come to phone . i then drove to this new address only to find the doors locked and nobody there . i drove almost 30 miles to get there and spent $ 11 on gas for nothing not to mention my time of close to 2 hours . so i am sol with what i paid for this coupon and my gas and i have nothing to show for it . this is no way to run a business .
0	i have such mixed feelings about the bagel cafe . i love-like-hate it , all at the same time . so , i will break it down as to why i feel the way i do . love : homemade food . fresh baked breads . house-made pickles ( seriously , they 're perfect ) friendly service like : their soups are off the chain ( i know it 's 100 degrees in vegas , but soup me ! ) corny newspaper menus selection of fresh baked pastries and cakes over-stuffed sandwiches . hate : warning : do n't share your sandwiches ( what , the what ? ! i do what i want with my sammie ) . pricing - $ 7.50 for a cup of soup . chaotic when entering . there 's no `` seat yourself '' sign or anyone really greeting you . how basic and homey the place feels . bland , uninspired food . bagel cafe is hidden in a business park and they 're always busy ( especially on the weekends - up to an hour wait ) . it 's got a huge area in the front where you can get deli meats , cheese , chips , sammies , soups , cookies , bagels , and every other sweet confection known to man to-go . there are about 30 tables/booths . there 's not a lot of ambiance and all employees where bagel cafe polo shirts so they 're easy to spot . bagel cafe is very hit-or-miss in regards to what you order . my matzo ball soup was excellent and full of chicken chunks ( and a few small bones ) , carrots , celery , and noodles . it 's tasty , but nothing that makes it memorable . the tuna salad was bland . i hardly ever reach for salt and pepper and i had to ! the nova platter small was a small amount of lox , olives , sliced tomato , sliced cucumber , and a pickle that was halved , it was $ 11.95 , way too much for mainly salad bar options . i also ca n't get over the fact that they sell 1/4 & 1/2 lb sandwich options and state do not share . i get that if you are at an ayce sushi place or dining at a 5 star restaurant , but at a breakfast/brunch spot ? i do what i want with my sandwich and sharing is caring ! at the end of the day , the bad outweights the good here . overpriced , restrictions , dull food , and lack of organization makes this place a `` meh '' in my book .
1	great organization & great prices !
1	i have been using blue cross animal hospital for more than 30 years . you will not find a better facility in the phoenix area . the staff is informed and caring and the doctors ca n't be beat ! if there were 10 stars available they would get them from me !
0	came here on a friday for drinks and had a great experience . was looking forward to trying out the food so brought the whole family for sunday lunch . bottom line , no one will be going back a second time . the chicken and the steak tacos ( corn tacos which are homemade ) were so soggy they fell apart on the first bite . the carne asada was burnt and the beans were filled with loads of fatty pork . chips and salsa were average but you are charged $ 3 . i hope they are still tweaking the menu and will change the `` family style '' serving style . the portions are definitely not big enough to share and people get confused on who 's food belongs to who .
1	this place does n't get voted `` best burger in town '' for nothing ! the menu has something for everyone , even vegetarians . i recommend the white hut and tater tots , but there are more than enough options to customize your own burger just the way you like it . they even have a taco burger ! my only complaint is that the place is n't bigger ! as packed as the place stays , it can feel a little claustrophobic in there . try to get a table at the back or sit outside . [ edit ] just went again last night and had the western burger . it 's a buffalo patty with bbq sauce , delicious onion straws , and cheese . i 'm willing to go out on a limb and say it just might have been the best burger i 've had in charlotte to date ! [ /edit ]
1	love .
0	decent for fast food mexican . i had a hard taco which was good but not at all warm . i also had a cheese enchilada which i didnt much care for because it was n't warm at all so not melty and delicious . i will definitely have tacos again for quick takeout . my husband and those two items as well and also a tostada . his comments were .. '' pffffff '' he was disappointed because of all the good reviews and check please arizona . easy cheap fast lunch but there are better choices at same price point .
0	we ate at joyful house two saturdays ago . we ordered egg rolls , kung pao shrimp and roasted duck . the duck was a major disappointment . it looked decent at first , but once i dug in it was fatty , tough and grizzly . i 've never had to work so hard to get to the meat before . our waiter came by and asked how we were doing , i mentioned that the duck was very difficult to eat . he brought me wet naps . it was appreciated , but a knife might have been more helpful . photos are posted .
1	we love to come here . the food is always good and service is always helpful . we love the punch card it helps us be more loyal .
0	this place is a complete joke ! expensive drinks and lame management who tries to control the way people dress and actually they hunt u down and force into buy the watered down drinks which is tacky to me . vegas needs to do better the clubs in this circle are a complete joke !
0	the quad ( formally the imperial palace ) is in the middle ( i hope ) of renovations and upgrades . its casino has been the obvious recipient of much of the time and efforts so far . the casino is up to date , has lots of options , and is for the most part easily navigable . the food , is another area that has gotten some attention . guy fiere 's new restaurant vegas is located in the quad as well as hash house a go go ( open 24 hours ) . both were solid choices . there are also lots of choices in the surrounding area that looked inviting and had good menu choices from mexican to pub food . unfortunately , the quad has spent what appears to be nothing , upgrading their rooms . the hallway carpets have gross stains on them and there is an unpleasant smell throughout . the rooms are stuffy- and the air conditioner appears to have been set only to reach a certain temperature- only the fan worked in our room and during a vegas summer , that just does n't cut it . the lighting options are pretty minimal in the room , a table lamp , and bed lamp . the bathrooms are in need of a serious steam cleaning and a magic eraser . the carpets in the rooms desperately need to be replaced and the furniture could use some upgrading ( though they did have flat screen tvs ) . the wallpaper is peeling and there was a sizable water stain on the ceiling of our room as well . the patio doors do n't open anymore , which is unfortunate , i think this could be a nice feature . no free wireless- you pay an extra $ 9.99 a day . the quad 's pool at this time is currently under renovations- however , as a guest you have access to the pools at the flamingo and harrahs right next door- which was a nice accommodation . i paid a $ 22 resort fee each night ... i 'm not sure what i paid for with this . ( you only pay $ 28 at caesars and you get gym passes , free wi-fi , local calls , etc ... ) warning- the doors are pretty light and you should be sure that your door closes before you walk away . a security guard that was patrolling the hotel floors warned us that there had been a higher volume of thefts ) the area 's around the quad ( between the quad and the linq ) have all been upgraded and are beautiful . the walkway to the high roller attraction are great- lots of fun food options and a new kitson store ... hopefully the quad continues to upgrade and renovate their hotel , as a whole , it just does n't fit in with the surrounding area . of all the caesars entertainment properties , the quad is dead last on the list of choices . i 've stayed with caesar 's properties before , and i was pretty disappointed with the overall quality of this hotel . i was n't expecting , say what you might have at the newly redone cromwell , or at the other higher end properties , but i did expect cleanliness , and a basic level of quality . caesars entertainment should have thought about closing the property completely before renaming and opening it to the public . i would be skeptical to return even with renovations to the rooms ...
1	y'all do n't know good eatin ' 'til you stopped at jamburritos ! my tastebuds died , went to heaven . i 'm a southerner . i do not , i do not , order fried catfish in restaurants outside of certain states in the south . it just does n't happen . something about folks in other states putting beer batter or breadcrumbs or flour based breading on it that runs me outta the restaurant . but i figured , this mex-cajun fusion way would be something to try . i ordered a fried catfish jamburrito ... that 's fried catfish , with jambalaya ( 2 staples in my kitchen ) and all the other fixin 's of a burrito . i got the fire hot sauce on the side and i also ordered up the hush puppies . they had faygo pops ( yep , i said `` pops '' , that 's cause i 'm from the south . if you 're from other southern regions , you might call it a `` cold drink '' . ) that took me back years to my childhood and i ordered up the orange faygo . whoop whoop ! so , what does this southerner say ? they killed it . the hush puppies were absolutely delicious . a bit on the small side in comparison to what i 'm accustomed to having back home . but exactly the taste you want in a hush puppy ! wow . i 'm bringing my mom to the truck , i bet she has n't cooked hush puppies since i was a kid . the jamburrito was something out of this world . the taste of the jambalaya in every bite of the catfish was an amazing mixture of spiciness with the delicious cajun flavor of the rice . and do n't forget that there 's also beans and all the fixins of a burrito . the lettuce and fresh veggies help to cool the zing of the spice from the hot sauce . if you do n't like spicy , do n't get the hot sauce on yours . here 's a pic of my plate : http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jamburritos-cajun-grille-express-phoenix ? select=xh1ac9x35epqywgj9qzbna # 7gsc9b6jr19chmrtb40tma what a creative fusion of the mexican burrito and cajun food . i was so satisfied and thrilled with the tastes and flavors . i have to go back and try their friend crawfish and perhaps some other things that will take me down the mississippi river of memories ... bravo jamburritos ! bravo .
0	nice sports bar . tvs all over showing many different games . food is just ok. would n't come back here for a meal .
1	this sub shop is right around the corner from where i live , so i manage to stop by often . my husband and i always get the same thing .... the tuna sub on wheat . one of these days we have to branch out , but the tuna is really good . and they have lots of optional veggies for the sandwiches that we love . friendly staff too ! and they have a frequent users club so eventually you get your sub for free . ca n't beat that !
1	i have gone to this place for years and the barbecue chicken special always is great . it has a friendly place and in a `` unique '' part of town . my recommendation is to try it out on first fridays if you need that motivation to go downtown to the arts district . it is in the center of where the `` best action '' for first friday starts . the cobalt blue gallery of eddie http : //www.youtube.com/user/cob4ltblu3 http : //shop.cob4ltblu3.ihost.net/category.aspx ? categoryid=18 is just down the block and it a wonderful match for the food .
0	snottiest , most arrogant office i have ever been to . after waiting 90 minutes past our appointment time , without so much as an `` i 'm sorry we are running late '' or `` would you like a glass of water ? `` , some snotty woman comes out and lectures us about how special his excellency is and how we should all be good little boys and girls . find another office ! ! ! !
1	a cool museum that offers a glimpse into an enigmatic icon who just so happens to be a pittsburgh native . the silver clouds room is worth the price of admission alone , perhaps because it 's so unexpected amidst the endless number of celebrity portraits . also , this summer 's warhol live exhibit really brings the artwork to life , especially since the museum is sponsoring a concert series in conjunction with the exhibition . definitely worth checking out .
0	i had an ok time staying at the wynn . i was part of a large vip group traveling together who had contacted the wynn in advance of our stay to secure a `` preferred '' room rate which was for two deeply discounted rooms for a weekend stay . after several phone confirmations that our reservation was indeed of the `` preferred '' variety before our arrival , it took the first two days of our stay at the hotel to reach the appropriate staff members in order to confirm the proper rate for the third night . this hassle along with my mixed feelings accompanying the various hotel staff we encountered during our stay ( ranging from helpful and genuinely friendly to totally pompous and stand-offish ) left me feeling that the wynn certainly could have offered more from a customer-service standpoint given the caliber of its reputation . secondly , i would say that the overall value of the hotel rooms we were given left something to be desired . the rooms were nice and had some nice things in them , but i did n't feel like i was staying in a five-diamond hotel room . we had a golf-course view which was not that exciting ( it 's mostly an `` encore construction '' and `` hilton with barry manilow banner '' view right now ) and the room was n't all that spacious . i will say that the bathroom was disproportionately large , and that the beds were very comfortable . but wireless internet was $ 14 per day in the rooms , and the snack/minibar was rigged with pressure sensors to automatically charge your account should things be removed for too long . maybe steve should have spent the money he used on those snack bar weights and scales to add a few square feet to the rooms instead , or offer the basic amenity of internet access to his guests . i was really expecting to be wowed at the wynn but i think my expectations were much too high .
0	when it comes to food , i never pretend to know something about cuisines that i was only introduced to a few years ago - or at least i let people know that up front when i write a review about it . that being said , ramen sora has good ramen - at least i think it is good . the noodles definitely have a unique flavor that i have not run across before . i ate the whole bowl , so i must have liked it . however , maybe i was spoiled by monta down the street , because i was bummed to find they had so few choices of add-ins like chili oil or pickled ginger . while i will admit that i really liked the food , i do n't expect that his will be where i find myself when i drive down to chinatown for ramen .
0	i 'll take a side of burger with my order of grease ... i want all you yelpers out there to know that before i have a heart attack from eating at five guys that it 's been fun , i had some great reviews , i do n't think i 'm gon na make it and i love you all ... goodbye .
0	i like this place . the food is pretty good and it 's a good value . but how come no napkins in the dining room ? i also might encourage management to wash and/or replace the plastic bowls they use for chips .
0	i can never find any employees around the store when i need help with something . i went in last week to buy a mattress , tv , and sound system . cound n't find anyone to help me with the mattresses so i had to pull it down myself , and i needed help choosing a sound system they had a display for but i could n't find it in the box , so they lost a sale there . its just absurd to have a huge store and have no employees around to help .
1	definitely the best coffee shop in the champaign-urbana area . the prices are reasonable , the music ( at times ) is decent , and the baristas for the most part are friendly . on top of this , they have consistent closing hours at midnight . the reason for four stars is that it can occasionally be a hit or miss on the quality of the prepared drink . also , the sandwich sizes are tiny given their price .
0	we did get contacted by mandalay bay and got some money back . nice of them but do n't think we 'll stay there ever again . all the issues could of should of been addressed at the time .
0	food is meh , for the not-exactly-cheap pricetag , it 's honestly unimpressive . i would n't say i 'm disappointed per se , nothing tasted bad , but there are better alternatives , even in the vicinity of the strip alone .
0	i guess i should congratulate franktuary for serving the third best hot dog in pittsburgh . what a huge disappointment ! how can a place that claims to honor the hot dog serve such a bad dog ? regardless of the topping the physical wiener is the heart of it all . this one just does n't cut the mustard . it is thin , bland , was missing that delightful snap and was so small that it seemed to swim in the bun . my wife and i both ordered a beer and a hot dog while there . i had the chicago impostor and she had the mexican . the city of chicago should mourn that someone would liken this offering to their glorious dog . because the wiener is so small it had too many toppings . the toppings also sucked . halved cherry tomatoes and a gross relish . as for my wife 's mexico dog she said that she could n't really remember much about it 45 minutes after we ate . that should say it all . the poutine fries we tried were also overly salty . i guess my problem with this and a lot of the hipster restaurants in the lawrenceville area is that no one cares if it is local and sustainable if it is n't good or better than the original . one final note , i found it offensive to chefs around the world that the guy making poutine and hot dogs felt the need to rock a chef 's coat . i guess if i have white jump suit and a model rocket i can call myself an astronaut
0	they definitely arent as good as they used to be providing things like rib eye steak and certain kbbq side dishes .. back about a couple years ago i would give them a 4 star rating .. still an option though
1	awesome food and great lunch specials . my son and i ate lunch there for under $ 15 . you ca n't be that . our waitress was great as well .
0	although the staff here is very very nice , the food at best is just meh .... i visited recently with a friend and found the menu and food to be uninspired . i ordered the soup , salad and breadsticks . first of all , it bagged salad and about a cup of it at that . it 's not a bread stick , it 's a slice of garlic toast . and the soup , the soup was pretty good . it was semi-homemade chicken noodle soup . it 's not unlimited but it is only $ 5 . you do get what you pay for in that respect . my friend ordered the mostaccoli with meatsauce and salad . the pasta was overdone and the meatsauce was pretty salty . i suppose for the older crowd that this place attracts in sun city , this food is great , but honestly , it was nothing special . it was n't bad ... it just was n't good either .
1	after a weekend high rollin at the cosmo , the wife and i wanted to get a quick bite before heading back to reality . i saw this joint and the 20.12 special for lunch . we were tired of the usual breakfast fare so we thought we would try something different . glad we did . this restaurant has a very cool , modern feel to it . high end looking but not snobby . we each got the lunch special . for appetizer i got the grilled octopus . got ta pay an extra $ 10 but well worth it . nice char to it and a surprisingly good portion with olive oil and seasonings . the wife got the greek plate which consisted of a hummus , a tzatziki ( did i spell that right ? ) , and some kind of bell pepper spread with like 3 pieces of pita . the wife loved it but again why only 3 pieces of pita ? for main course , i got the lavraki which is a sea bass . nice and light with olive oil and lemon . just 3 bites in , the wife was eyeing my plate . so we did the ol switcheroo . that means i ended up eating her tuna burger . while not a big fan of tuna burgers this one was actually pretty good . its not a seared tuna , its fully cooked but surprisingly not dry . for dessert , the wife got a yogurtini and i got the walnut cake . the yogurtini was more like a yogurt parfait . the walnut cake was nice and moist . i think that you can not go wrong with the lunch special . since we sat near the kitchen i saw the lamb chops and lobster pasta going out and they both looked pretty tasty . next time , we may try the dinner menu . thumbs up from me .
1	horribly cliche , but you can tell your parents you 're going to the library on friday night . i grew up with stories from my dad telling me he told his parents that . i was hesitant to come here the first time , not always hearing the best of the things . the place is a little oddly shaped and watching a bachelor be embarrassed on the bar top left me more hesitant . but then , the music started . my friends and i quickly made friends with the djs on the dance floor . on thursdays , i believe they have a live cover band playing . the only thursday i swung in here , they sounded pretty darn good . on saturdays , they play a mix of hip hop and rap ( late 90 's through current ) and techno dance music . i 'd recommend this place as a legitimate stop . the drinks are good and the waitresses/bartenders are attentive and kind . a good place to meet and hangout without any of the hype or expensive drinks you 'll find at some of the surrounding mill late night stops . give it a try if you 've never been , or make it a stop on your next bar golf night .
0	i 've been to hash house three times ( once for breakfast , twice for lunch ) . the food is big , and tasty ... but the service is very uneven , with slow check-backs from the server , and long delays in delivery of food . if you do n't mind less-than-attentive service , a trip to hash house is definitely worth it . personally , i like it for breakfast more than lunch ...
1	excellent , authentic thai and super convenient location near sherbrooke station ! this place is small ( just a few tables , best for groups under 4 people ) although i suppose in the summer the patio increases their capacity . the vibe is intimate and cozy . food may take a while to arrive , but it 's worth it . presentation is excellent ( fried rice served in a pineapple , tom yum soup served in a coconut ! ) and the dishes are flavourful , with a really good amount of spice . i really loved the spicy chicken salad with lettuce leaves . the menu is small with some interesting dishes , not just your usual standard thai dishes that you see everywhere . be sure to see what the daily specials are . service when i went was excellent and thoughtful - definitely no attitude from the server regarding my subpar french ! i would certainly come back here next time i am in montreal .
1	i had a dent in my lift gate and came to all team to get it fixed . they did an awesome job , the car looks good as new , the price was incredibly reasonable , and they got it done super quickly . they were also super nice , i mainly dealt with alex and he was great . i was very happy with their service , would highly recommend them , and will definitely use them again in the future !
0	i have are here twice and both times the food was pretty good . they are extremely heavy handed on the salt though . the service is okay . the breakfast food in my opinion is over priced compared to other diners of the same quality .
0	do n't stop here if you have a meeting to get to . i would be fine if this was my vacation and do n't mind waiting 10+ minutes for a simple cup of coffee . terrible service ! ! ! ! !
0	do n't bother with this company , he was scheduled to do work for me and was a no call , no show and wo n't answer his phone .
0	the hotdogs are okay , pricing is n't bad , but the guy that was serving me was a douche ! i 've been to places where the food was good enough to overlook the service ... this is n't one of them !
0	this place is overrated , over priced and over sized ! the sandwich i had today had no flavor and was not made how i asked . i will not be visiting this place again .
1	ethnic confusion ? no way ! i 'm gon na go ahead and give this a 5 . `` hole in the wall '' as a description of a place is never a derogatory comment in my universe and more of a compliment , but only if the food absolutely rocks - which it did ! and , as a bonus , the concept just blew me away . meat spinning on a spit and greek specialties on the menu , with indian specialties off to the other side - seems like ethnic confusion , right ? well , let me tell you , right down to the sauce , the gyro absolutely rocked ! i was eating it and it was like i never wanted it to end . i am in town for the weekend and i am going to have to grab one on my way out . the only thing better than one of these is two of them . no joke , yo ! if you are in pittsburgh , go an get a gyro from these people and yelp about them but good . i want this place to be here when i come back . the food speaks for itself so i 'm sure there are no worries but , yelp speaks for food . good eating to all of you and well , well , well done , bombay !
1	this is a fun place to eat , drink and rest your feet after a full day of trekking around the vegas shops . located in the venetian , this restaurant has patio seating on the `` grand canal . '' the margaritas were lip-smacking good and my tres fish tacos ( $ 13 ) was excellent . they happily take reservations . the service was excellent and the waiter was quite happy to put up with a bunch of questions and joking from me and the girls . overall , good food at a decent price for vegas , right in the heart of the venetian .
1	it 's a bit of a pain to find but yes , they have be best prices i have seen . be sure to stop by and stock up during your visit to vegas .
0	this by far has to be my worst experience at a hotel . thank god i did n't pay for this crappy place . my employer did . this place is super old and run down . the only modern thing i saw was the tv in the room and that they have wifi . the worst part for me was the bathroom . they work fine if your only going to urinate . but if by any chance you need to do # 2 .... you might want to say a little prayer and hope it flushes . because there is a high probability it wo n't and everything will start overflowing on the floor .. i feel bad for whoever has to clean it up because i sure ai n't going to do that ..
1	me and bf went to cafe lago on 4/25/2010 for sunday brunch . we had a great time there because the atomsphere was cozy and nice , and the staff were really friendly , too . food was okay , lack of variety is probably the weakness , but the quality of the juice , omelet , crab legs , prime ribs , and pancakes were pretty good , at least i kept wanting more and more . sushis do not look good just like many other buffets in vegas we enjoyed and had a great time , if you are looking for a good place to chat and just relax and enjoy some food , this is for you !
0	crepe shack and waffles is okay . the service is good , the venue nice . but i was n't a fan of the crepes or waffles . the ice cream was too melted . i felt there was too much crepe to ice cream ratio . and the waffles were too hard . i may be biased though because i 'm happy with just ice cream .
0	you wo n't find a better deal for dinner . if you sign up for a player 's card , you receive an additional discount . as buffets go , this is the best one in downtown vegas . the food is consistently above average to very good and you wo n't be waiting in epic lines to get in , and to get your food . of note , the desserts are top notch and the selection very good , although the steaks and brisket selections are often hit or miss . if you want to save some cash for the tables and fill up on decent food , then this buffet is your best bet .
1	not a coffee snob and i do n't wear scarves or own a `` fixie , '' so take this review with a grain of regular ol ' table salt . atmosphere is small and pleasant , and they predictably had some nice indie-flavored muzak . the outdoor seating looks really pleasant , but indian school and 7th street does n't do much to provide a view . girl working there was awesomely friendly , but a little disappointed when i ordered an iced coffee . she kept waiting with a wishful look in her eye that i might add something to it , some undiscovered new twist or challenge for her to make to order . i get the feeling that the staff here is rather bored with coffee - if you or someone else you know has a difficult order with way too many adjectives , get them down to urban beans . they 're hungry for the challenge . iced coffee was decent , average priced . four stars for the friendly staff and great atmosphere .
0	i can only speak about realtor justin goodman . he could n't care less about a buyer . he makes you do all the leg work and then takes credit for it . he is quite impersonal and unprofessional . we had arranged to see a house with him and when we show up he has his toddler age son with him . his son was running around the house and causing a ruckus . i understand kids will do this but this sort of activity is inappropriate for the situation . he would only suggest houses that he had listed . trying to get the whole commission i presume . we went elsewhere and our new agent found exactly what we were looking for . good riddance justin goodman and majestic prop .
0	after reading so many good reviews about capitol tire on yelp and google , i decided to join the masses and bring my car to a trusted mechanic . i was having issues with my brakes and figured it was a brake fluid problem , and arranged for an oil change since it was due as well . i figured there was going to be potential for a costly repair on the brakes , so i braced myself for that . i dropped off my car right away in the morning at 8am and by 3pm i had n't heard anything . i ended up calling to find out if i needed another ride home or what . turns out i had a leaky brake fluid line underneath my car where some fuel lines and brake lines run together , and the mechanic was hesitant to touch anything for fear of damaging rusty car parts . he explained the situation and it was more dire than i had expected . i felt like i swallowed a softball when he told me the cost to fix what he recommended , with most of the cost coming from dealer parts that he checked out . i have the advantage of having a friend in milwaukee who fixes cars on the side and called him up to explain what the mechanic told me . he agreed that it sounded like a little bit of a hassle to fix , but scoffed at the price they quoted me . in the end , i had my friend fix my brake lines and a wheel bearing that were in question .... the only difference is that my friend saved me about a thousand dollars , compared to what capitol tire was going to charge . it was well worth the hour trip to take my car to my friends to get fixed . i have no doubt that capitol tire would have done a good job on my car , and i have to say the little i had to deal with them , i was appreciative of the good customer service . however , be warned : like most mechanics , you will pay a lot for anything they feel is not an easy job . as for the oil change , you can go to a lot of places for a lot cheaper ( i did n't find any coupons or deals for capitol tire ) . oil changes are just gateways for upselling other costly services they deem important .
1	came in here on a sunday night trying to kill a little time . the 4 of us sat at the bar , and little did we know but we were in for a show . jake is hands down the best bartender in phoenix . we sat and watched in amazement as he created his masterpieces with care . none of us had anything specific in mind , so all we had to tell him was the kind of liquor we like , he would make a recommendation , and then make it . i 'm a whiskey drinker , so he made an excellent ( insert name here-because there is no name for it yet ) drink , that was definitely what i was looking for . highly recommend coming down here and asking for him !
1	after eating here , i 'm questioning every five star review i 've ever given . this restaurant is truly deserving of five stars . my boyfriend and i came in this past saturday and was welcomed by a very friendly staff . we had made reservations , so there was only a short wait while the host checked to see if our table was ready . after my boyfriend took a smoke break , the girl led us into the restaurant and welcomed us to london and described the meaning behind the red chandelier/art piece that was hanging on the ceiling . she then let us know that our booth was on the upper floor and gave us the option of the stairs or elevator . we said we did n't mind either one and she led us up the short staircase . she seated us and left . we were immediately greeted by muuhamaduu ( spelling ? ) and offered drinks . after he left , tony came and introduced himself letting us know he 'd be back to explain the meats . he was thorough and answered any questions we had . he kept a smile on his face the whole time , which i found to be very warm and welcoming . after tony 's presentation , we settled on the mac n cheese , beef wellington , and the rib cap for my boyfriend . the food came out quickly . my boyfriend had taken a smoke break ( again ) during this time , and the servers and waiters were very friendly and joked that they would finish his dinner if he did n't come back in time . the mac n cheese was the most delicious mac n cheese i 've ever eaten . my boyfriend said it did n't beat his favorite boxed velveeta , but he still finished it off . the beef wellington and rib cap was also amazing . there is no words to describe how delicious it was . what surprised me was the few pieces of vegetables that were served with the beef wellington . i hate carrots , my boyfriend loves carrots , and some how , this was the best piece of carrot either of us had ever eaten . we finished off our meal by ordering the sticky toffee pudding for dessert . muuhammaduu guessed what i wanted before i ordered and said it was one of the best things there . it was actually one of the best things i 've ever put in my mouth . get it . it 's amazing . boyfriend agreed and was scraping the bottom of the plate when we were done . during our meal tony and muuhammaduu were very attentive and friendly . they talked to us and asked how things were , offered suggestions , and even chit chatted with us . they were awesome and i would love to work with them again . thanks guys for the great night !
1	i have been going to this studio lately and i love their classes ! they have lots of amazing teachers with different style and there is something for every levels . i really like the flow classes as they have a faster pace but i also have a soft spot for the candlelight yoga class on friday evening as they have live musician coming and playing soft music as we do our poses . it is not the hardest class but it is definitely the most soothing for the soul ! they also have special promotions from time to time such as hiking and yoga at red rock , special yogi master teaching , seminars , etc ... i am definitely addicted !
0	big , smelly and industrial . it is a cheap place to stay in edinburgh . the dorms are swampy and unpleasant , but the double rooms are functional .
0	went through the drive-through , after trying to decipher whatever the lady was trying to tell me on the intercom i ordered 3 chicken tenders , mashed potatoes and gravy , and coleslaw . i usually check the order right then and there because most of the drive-through people are just downright idiots , but this time i try to have faith in mankind . when i get home , i open the box to find a chicken leg , a thigh , macaroni and cheese , and coleslaw . i did n't even get a receipt and felt that going back and fighting with these idiots was pointless . i 'm done .
0	i used to eat here before the remodeling and enjoyed some of the best chicken wings i 've ever had . sadly , the wings are no longer available leaving this place a poor option for dinner . my lady friend and i sat at the bar and were given menus made of printer paper ( they used to have real menus ) and were informed that our bartender and our waitress would be two different people ( ? ? ? ? who does that ? ) . upon learning that wings were no longer available i decided on a gourmet burger . placed my order , paused a bit at the end and said `` are n't you gon na ask me how i want it cooked ? '' . waitress says `` oh they 're cooked medium well or something '' . canceled my order for a burger . not gon na pay 11 bucks for a burger from a place that does n't know how to cook meat . ordered bacon `` cheese '' fries . disgusting vegetable oil type `` cheese '' on rather average fries . my lady friend ordered slider burgers , they were n't bad for a place that does n't know how to cook meat . and despite all this , i would still come back if i could get those fantastic wings ! : ( if you want a burger , go to brgr . want wings ? go to capri . want a menu that is n't a sheet of printer paper ? go anywhere .
0	while the company was awesome the food and service was far less memorable . the servers were uptight and stilted . the brunch fair was quite limited and while prepared with a chef 's flare lacked that breakfasty feel you look for with brunch . would not go back again for brunch .
0	first things first , do n't order from here . the service is just as bad as the food . okay , maaaybe a little bit worse . im not sure if they still have the same crew working there or not but daisia , the girl who answered the phone , should work somewhere else or go to a customer service class . i called and she answered with `` can i put you on hold ? '' then didnt wait , just put me on hold . a couple minutes later she took my order like she has waaay better things to do and completely disregarded my request to get a phone call when the delivery man was outside my door instead of a knock . of course the delivery man came to my door and knocked loud enough to wake everyone up and get my dogs to bark up a storm . he said he was n't told to call and then slammed my screen door . so i called the store again and miss daisia answered with her 'hold ' greeting and when i asked to speak to a supervisor , he apologized and said there was `` nothing he could do '' . i hung up and proceeded to just eat my food and put it all behind me . but the bread was still very doughy and the pasta was so hard , it was crunchy . i threw that crap away . i made sure to get my refund but wow , you guys suck ! i tried giving them a second chance but the food came out just the same and the daytime manager was rude enough for me to write my first bad review on here . apparently all the breadbowls come out doughy unless you call to let them know you want it cooked all the way through . maybe if i order wings they 'll deliver a dead chicken and tell me i shouldve called to have it cooked instead .
0	this place is a joke . and not only this location . they use to be decent but after weeks of asking for serious mass , which most places carry they continue to tell me they would order some . they use to carry it regularly . even told me twice they would set some aside for me . neither time did it happen and one time the rep told me they forgot to order it . they have low variety , unless you want their brand of stuff . they constantly try to push it on you . never have the flavors you want and the staff seems to care less if you come back or not . lets not talk about the time i asked for whey protein and the lady pointed me to the section with creatine . want a better store that 's considerably cheaper and offer a wide variety of products , go to las vegas discount nutrition . if they do n't have a product they will order it for the next day . he 'll even one of the guys ran to a nearby store to pick up what i need . goodbye nr , you lost a regular customer .
0	i 'd give it a most improved rating for service my wife and late sister-in-law loved this place for brunch after church on sunday . i hated it because of the service , food was always good but service was exceptionally slow to where it was painful just to go . finally relented and went back last sunday for brunch . it was crowded as usual but the appear to have learned how to better manage the crowd . when i walked in and looked at the crowd , i expected at least half and hour wait . we were seated in just over 15 minutes and our server was right there to give us menus and take our orders . i had the steak and eggs and they came our perfect in a very reasonable amount of time . too early to give them an approval rating because this could have been a aberation but if they continue like this time , they are well on the their way to getting just that .
0	they have a big sign stating that the meat is never prepackaged or pre-sliced . i ordered pastrami . and it was prepackaged and pre-sliced . she pulled it our from a fridge . it was in a cup . so much for that gimmick . the bread was n't very fresh . the ladies were friendly . the food was ok. no better than a subway .
1	i 'm addicted ! did n't realize how good it was mmm
0	cheap food and quality . nice counter help . it is just another fast food place .
1	so your best friend of the boy variety who also happens to be an extremely charming french-speaker brings you to an awesome spot for saturday brunch , filled with glorious accents , fresh pastries and shelves tumbling with fine wines and tasty cheeses . it reads like the opening few minutes of a romantic movie . and then the two of you start the iphone yelp check-in war of the century . it swiftly becomes a comedy . yep , if anything were to sum up myself and my delightful companion that day , that would be it . i shall once again hang my head and apologise that i became duchess of le marche francais in a city i do n't even live in . but hey , that 's just how comforting edinburgh is ! it makes you feel as if you already * are * home . we were n't sure that we followed correct protocol - picking out our pastries then taking them up to the counter to eat in , but be certain that the people who run this place are both accommodating and honest . the guy at the counter told us ( well , told chris m in french ) that we were welcome to take out our brunch or eat in , and he said that it 's rather more expensive to eat in . still , because the place was so pleasant and ambient we chose to eat in anyway . it 's so relaxed that i could quite easily envisage myself bringing a book to a place like this and settling in for the morning ... afternoon ... heck , as long as they 'll have me . i went for my favourite maple pecan plait as soon as i clocked it and it did n't disappoint . it 's a hard thing to get wrong ( even supermarkets do these well ) but when you need a knife and fork towards the end of it because the things so fresh and gooey , you know you 've landed on your feet . the francophile himself went for a traditional breakfast of croissant , bread and hot chocolate which looked equally awesome . not only is this a great morning place but it 's actually a french restaurant too , bursting with salads , sandwiches and main meals , and it 's a shop to boot ... all of which i 'll be exploring if i get a chance to go back . so that 's great food , lovely service , awesome atmosphere ... can it do anything wrong ? non , franc-ly .
1	this place took me back to my midwest roots of bars . . . a great talkative bartender . . . great local regulars who were n't afraid to get into a conversation with you . had the bartender suprize me with my drink . . . don '' t laugh . . . a `` white gummy bear '' . . . not sure what was in it , but it was a great tasty drink to end the afternoon partion of the dive bar tour . i will definately be back on future tour to las vegas . . . if for nothing else to see the karoake .
0	we 've been here several times and usually enjoy the casual , family friendly atmosphere . tonight we had a bad experience so not sure we 'll be back , at least not anytime soon . they were n't too busy when we arrived , seemed a normal weeknight crowd . when our food took forever we overheard our server tell the table next to us ( when they inquired 'where 's our food ? ' ) they were understaffed in the kitchen . our food was served almost an hour after we arrived with no explanation or apology . the kids fries were barely warm , mac & cheese was like soup , hubby 's fish tacos were ok and my spinach salad was ok as well . i would expect the manager to be offering an apology , maybe even a complimentary bread appetizer to hold us over ( especially the kids ! ) , or at the very least the server should have offered an apology .
1	wow ! decided to eat away from the tourist spot . i found a coupon in one of the lv booklets you get at the hotel , it was buy one get one free breakfast . this place is definitely worth going to . it 's about 10mins from the strip . food : corned beef hash and eggs , eggs benedict florentine , banana muffins . corned beef hash : husband really enjoyed the `` real '' corned beef in the hash ! eggs benedict florentine : yummy ! the sauce was delicious , i think i would stick with the original eggs benedict . the spinach was served fresh and not saut\u00e9ed which i was expecting . banana muffins : this is what they are known for ! must get them ! ! they were so good , we ordered 6 to take back to the hotel ! the service was awesome too : )
1	fat me loved this place ! my stomach has shrunk a lot so it 's not as enjoyable now , unfortunately . okay yeah this place is pricey . it 's at the wynn so it 's actually the more fast if not economical option . the burger is amazing and so is the pastrami sandwich . there 's even a pastrami burger for the best of both worlds .
1	if you 're looking for a stylish place to grab a vodka drink , red square is a great place to meet a date or business partners . they really run with the gimmick , including a vodka vault that you can gain access to by purchasing a bottle of ( overpriced ) vodka and donning oversized fur coats . signature cocktails run around $ 14 , bottles of smirnoff start at $ 200 , plus there is food if you choose to be seated at a table . they have an ice bar and really great decor but , if you 're looking for something truly authentic ( including any russian beers other than baltika ) , you wo n't find it here . still , i recommend it !
0	took car in for oil change at 11am . i had to call at 5:12pm to check on car . yes , i had to make my own courtesy call to find out nothing was done on the car . i was told when i called that it had an oil leak so they pulled car out and did nothing else to it ! sears , this was a chance for you to earn my business . now , i will remind people why you could soon go out of business . update : the car never had an oil leak . sears . wrong again
1	i finally got to have dinner here and everything was a great experience ! we celebrated a birthday here with a group of 6 people and we had made reservations and were lucky enough to have it near enough the patio that we were able to view the bellagio water show during dinner ! the girls started out with a martini that had grey goose and champagne and i think something else too which was really good ! the escargot was delicious ! it was in a pesto sauce which can out nice and hot ! the brie and garlic starter was also very delicious and it was really good with the fresh baguettes they had as well ! i had the rib eye and lots of different sides and everything was good ! i love to eat my meat medium rare and it 's hard to find places that actually make it medium rare ! it 's always more medium than it is rare but mon ami gabi did a great job ! the meat was tender and very flavorful .
1	you ca n't miss this montreal institution . this huge orange ball on decarie serves hot-dogs and this interesting creamy orange juice . i work steps away from this place and its great in the summer .
1	this is the 2nd year that my daughters are enrolled at bunker dance center . last year i had one in ballet and one in a ballet/tap combo class . the teachers are all very approachable and friendly to the kids . some of the teachers were students at the school when they were younger . what i love about bunker is that every june they have an amazing totally professional dance concert featuring the school 's dancers . it is also a family ran business . what i do n't particularly care for is that fact that they accept new students up until march of the same year that the concerts are held . my youngest was in a class last year that started out with 9 kids . they each practiced very hard each week to master the routines they were being taught . then comes march and 10 more kids joined the class . most of the 10 kids that joined late could have really used extra practice because they were n't familiar with the routines at all . it was annoying to see the teachers have to spend extra time with the new kids struggling to figure out the movements . one of the parents told me she joins late every year to save money from having to pay when the classes start in august . : ( overall i think the class prices ( $ 45 a month for a weekly class ) are very reasonable and my kids have fun here while getting a great workout .
1	been meaning to update my review after i had my service done ! it was as great as i expected . the hospitality and service at this place is amazing . i had popped in the day before my appointment because i wanted to make sure i could find the place and not be lost on my wedding day and we wanted to peek at the salon . they were so nice and offered to answer any questions i had . i had sewn in extensions and asked if it would be problem or not but they assured me it would be fine . they are so accommodating ! i ca n't say enough good things about this place , they helped make my wedding day wonderful . i 'm posting photos of my hair and also a shot of my wedding party because they did hair for all of them as well . even in 98 plus degree weather , our hair looked awesome !
0	these people are just screwups . ordered the miso soup , listed on the menu as having tofu and scallions . no tofu or scallions , but tons of mushrooms . also got the veggie burger which is listed with sweet potato fries , but no fries came with it . the only reason they get two stars is because it was a delicious veggie burger .
1	i stayed at the hotel for a week on business . the room was very big with a comfy bed and had all the basic amenities . i like having an in room fridge that is separate from the mini-bar . service was excellent and room service was quick and the food was good , although on the pricey side . dinner can easily exceed $ 40 . good thing the company was picking up the tab , otherwise i would not have ordered it . the hotel has a parking garage that was very easy to get in and out of which is better than the typical parking lot mazes that most hotels have . the only downside were the towels . felt like they did n't use fabric softener . i generally stay at marriott hotels , but this particular one was better than average and felt more upscale .
0	i just moved to this area , and wanted to find a great waxing salon . when first went to this establishment it was spotless and they got me in right away for a brazilian . when i showed up the place was impeccably clean , and i was extremely impressed . if only my experience was to end there . the front desk then informed me that they had a scheduling error and i would have to wait 45 minutes or reschedule . i decided to wait , as i was getting ready to vacation to san diego and wanted to be hairless for my beach vacation . while i waited there the front desk was unprofessional , talking about what staff was horrible and every bit of gossip this staff had to offer each other . once i went into the back room , the waxer was incredibly rude . she had no desire to turn my experience around . when i got home i had patches that were missed , and in the weeks that my hair was growing out i had horrible problems with ingrown hairs . i have been waxing for a year now , and never had a problem with ingrown hair . i am assuming this is way they try to sell you the serum against ingrown hairs because they know their `` special '' formula will cause you to have ingrown hairs . then to top it off the ladies at the front desk were extremely pushing on me pre-purchasing my next wax . i will never go back to this place ever again . especially for the price that they charge to have a wax .
0	compared to average micro-breweries on the west coast , four peaks is slightly below average . it probably would n't survive that long if they had to compete against their breweries . having said that , they are probably the second best in arizona ( oak creek in sedona is way better if beer is the only criterion ) . their beers are consistently ok but sometimes their porters and stouts are a little skunky . seasonal beers are good but i have never had a great one . i like the building it 's in but it sure is noisy when everyone is talking . they do n't have live entertainment which may be a good thing since they do n't need more noise . unless you are there with friends it 's kind of a boring place just to hang out , although there are plenty of cute college girls to look at . burgers are excellent . service is ok but i usually go when it 's not that busy .
1	i am no expert on places around this area ( right on mill avenue ) but this is a really great breakfast/brunch place ! my friend took me here when i was visiting and they have a varied menu so finding something that suits everyone should be pretty easy . i am a brunch lover so it really was n't hard to fall in love with the place , it is a very causal ambiance and overall great experience ( at least i had nothing to complain at as a visitor ) ! as a new yorker there is few places seat you outside , the outdoor seating might therefore be my favorite part . over all it is an excellent place for breakfast/brunch , i wish i could just work my way though their menu .
0	just the facts . food average this time . seems not as good when they are busy . service was helpful and pleasant . deal breaker . after waiting in line for bathroom . employee in front of me exited . upon entering found unflushed deuce . so , either he left it behind or failed to address before a customer entered . will not be back .
1	came here with a large group for lunch , and the place was packed . our service was attentive throughout our meal and everything came out in good time . everything i tasted was great , from our appetizer of sweet potato chips to my main the short rib tacos and black bean mango salad . the decor inside the restaurant was appealing as well . i 'll be returning soon .
1	as it looks like i 'm the only woman reviewer so far , this review is n't for the actual shave service offered , but for the sales and products . i wandered in here the first day of my first trip ever to vegas ... feeling a bit guilty that i was having all the fun while my husband was back home in the day to day . this was the perfect place to find him a little something to bring home with me . the man i talked with was very knowledgeable , and pitched but was n't pushy . the products are very high quality , no filler junk that 's hard on your skin . it all smells wonderfully manly but not overpowering . i chose a travel set that comes with a brush , pre-shave oil , shave cream , and after shave lotion . the containers are tsa approved , so they are around 3 oz . this set me back about $ 55 . ouch . however ! my husband loves this stuff ! he shaved yesterday morning and did n't get a `` 5 o'clock shadow '' until this morning ! ! this stuff is the bees knees people . he said he felt spoiled shaving - the only thing missing was a straight razor and a professional to do it for him . i 'll definitely take him here on his first trip to vegas , and i have no doubt he 'll be back every time we go !
0	food is not bad , but for all the reputation of puck , it 's way below expectation .
0	over-rated ... overpriced . food was just ok .
1	top 3 high/lowlights 1 ) unique menu 2 ) intimate atmosphere 3 ) great wine selection had dinner with some co-workers on tuesday night at heritage tavern . we made a reservation and were seated right away . they have a coat check which is really nice in the winter . there is enough room for you to move around here while still keeping the atmosphere really intimate . heritage has a unique drink and dinner menu ( with a lot of ingredients i have never heard of ! ) . i got a cider ( they have one on tap ! ) . we also got a bunch of appetizers including a meat and cheese plate , lamb tartare , and the shrimp tempura . the meat and cheese plate included pickled watermelon rinds which i had never had before , i thought they were good but definitely not for everyone i was with . the lamb tartare was served with potato chips and the combination was great . i did n't eat the tempura ( as you can expect it 's not gluten free ) but everyone at the table really liked it , especially since it came with deep fried , bacon wrapped cheese curds . the menu has vegetarian and gluten free options clearly labeled . i had the chicken with crawfish cream sauce ( gluten free ! ) for my entree and really enjoyed it . we were really impressed with the wine list as well . only downside of heritage tavern is that the service is kind of slow . our server kept leaving before anyone could ask her a question/order another drink , and it took a long time for our credit card to picked up .
0	unfortunately we are neighbors of this school . when we moved in we honestly could not have anticipated how completely unconcerned with their community they could be . there have been so many issues with the loud speakers . we expected the noise for games and were ok with that . but there have been cases of high school kids out on the field with no staff supervision plugging in their iphones and blaring music and just hanging out with friends . right now we are going on the 5th hour of blaring music with no game going on . and the school is on spring break so there is no one to even talk too . it is completely unacceptable the way they treat the people who live around them . oh and on the education bit ... the high school cheerleader were selling pom poms to raise money so we thought we would buy a couple . they were each three dollars . they tried to give me the wrong change three times before i had to tell them what the change should be !
1	went here for happy hour sushi and drinks again . it 's conveniently located off of the 51 and has an attractive bar area . i have eaten in the main restaurant and found it to be fine , but not a place i would pick as one of my favorites . the sushi is different , though . we always order off of the happy hour menu and it 's all delicious . they have the typical type of rolls , but also types i have never heard of that have more complex ingredients and flavors . i highly recommend it . the happy hour prices for food are not as low as i would like , but the sushi rolls are much larger than other places , so do n't order many or you will be taking them home . happy hour drink prices are good . the service was excellent . we basically had two waiters and the sushi chef stopped by to see if we had enjoyed our meal . even if you have been unhappy in the regular dining room , try going for sushi . you 'll be pleasantly surprised !
0	a little south of the strip= but the i15 is out the back-9 minute sto caesars and no traffic ! . lots to eat and do.this is not a clubby casino . it has a nice mix of things to do and no need to repeat what is already said .. the negative ( i ` ve stayed here multiple times ) is that it is waaaay too smoky in the casino area.the non smoking sections still inundated with smoke and persons who smoke while passing by .. very convenient to rental car hub and the actual airport . i would be ok staying here again , would think twice about gambling in all that smoke however and the rooms were nice and the staff was pleasant for the most part.casino card associate did hand us wrong info on some policy so perhaps training there would be in order . used the business center , free internet on their pcs was a nice touch and had to get some faxes which also was helpful .. $ 1 per page not free .
0	when giving two stars , the yelp star selector says `` meh . i 've experienced better '' and strangely enough the word `` meh '' is flagged on yelp 's own spell checker . this is puzzling to me . how is it that yelp can use the word `` meh '' yet their own spell checker rejects the use of this oh so appropriate verbiage , especially when describing viet kitchen . i work really close to this little place , which is always very clean and is staffed by some very nice folk . the menu selection is ample yet typical of any vietnamese fair ... pho , vermicelli dishes , french type sandwiches , spring rolls , etc . but everything i 've had is just .... here it comes ..... you know what i 'm gon na say .... you guessed it ..... meh . nothing is great , everything is just ok. where 's the love ? this is how i feel about the place . if you 're completely jonesing ( another term not in spell checker ) for vietnamese food , this place will satisfy your craving , but after your meal you might end up saying `` meh , i 've experienced better '' .
1	best vet i 've ever had . truly caring and compassionate . i left my last vet due to ridiculous and expensive tests they always wanted to run for the simplest things . felt like they were just out to make money . dr. burke is not like that at all . we are so happy we found him after being referred to him by another of his happy clients ! highly recommend him !
1	another fun hangout place with good food . my group sat outside near the cornhole area . after eating the achiote salmon ( which i recommend ! ) and ahi tuna salad ( which was ... ok ) , my friends and i played a couple rounds of the cornhole game ( ..... i think that 's what it 's called ) . the beer selection was good , as well . a lot of mid-20 to mid-30 year olds here ...
0	this restaurant is located right by the elevator to our room . we stopped by here numerous times before heading up to our room for drinks only . here 's what i remember .... in vegas and needed a couple drinks to take back to the room to enjoy the hot tub . 12 oz bud= $ 7.00 22 oz sapparo= $ 9.00 vodka soda= $ 11.00 `` strong '' vodka soda= $ 11.00 i did n't eat here but got drinks numerous times . i strongly suggest using the word `` strong '' when ordering mixed drinks instead of using the word `` double . '' the breakfast buffet looked average , although we did n't try it . will i again ? .. no because i wo n't be staying at new york new york again . tootles
1	amazing service , our wait staff was over the top . we dine in a lot of the top restaurants and private clubs and this was the best . food is fabulous , spectacular presentation , great selection .
0	worst hotel staff ever . very rude and would n't explain anything . i ca n't believe they can be hired for working with people . tiffany the girl at the check in counter was awful , and craig maulk the manager was worse . they called me a liar and asked to look at my bank account without ever saying what the problem was or explaining . rude rude rude . the toilet did n't flush and the water pressure was so low that it took 30 minutes to shower . the tile grout looks as if it had never been cleaned and to make that worse it 's white tile ! i woke up with hair on me and since it was blonde it was definitely not mine . pool was so small and freezing . the elevators did n't work . awful hotel save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else .
1	great hotel , beautifully maintained , pool was very nice , with plenty of chairs ( august ) . beds are very comfortable and turndown service is nice ( love how they turned the tv channel to the tranquility music channel each night ) . i will say the checkin procedures needs revamped . its one big free for all with no lines . needs more structure to checkin like aria next door ( one line ) . too many guests get to the front and take forever chit chatting while people people next to you zip on by . thats probably my only big complaint ... please fix checkin process .
0	wayyyyyyy overhyped . pizza was just ok , and overcooked to the point of not just blackened but just flat out burnt . the parking sucked , the wait was ridiculous ( we went out for an appetizer at majerle 's while waiting and had a better time with better food ) , and the beverage situation for non-alcoholc drinks was just plain stupid . atmosphere was way too loud and the waitstaff seemed scattered/discombobulated . wo n't be back any time soon , just not impressed enough to bother with it .
0	`` grab a seat where ever it 's clean ... if there 's any ! '' was the lovely greeting i received as i walk in ... so i proceed to grab a seat ... i 'm sorry but this is already a terrible experience at this all time famous favorite breakfast restaurant ... i think it 's time to revise customer service skills from their employees if u ask me ! i just want some steak and eggs for my post workout not to be treated like some inconvenience to your business ... there 's too many incredible people out there with no jobs to have this quality of employees running your business ! ugh it 's so annoying to see !
0	on 10/18/13 this company came out to my house to install a new hot water heater per my warranty company 's suggestion , that was about five months ago . last week noticed a water leak from the newly installed pipes and the water seemed to be rust colored , at that point i though i could tighten the fitting and i was able to a half turn on it , the next day same thing a half turn still dripping , day three i went lowe 's to get new fittings to stop this leak , while in the plumbing department a young man from that department stopped to help me with the fitting i showed him the rusted out pipe & showed him pictures from my cell phone and asked him how could a new pipe installed less than five months ago could be this rusted out to the point of almost falling apart , and his reply was he had only worked in the department for two months and , still he was knowledgeable enough to know that when working with plumbing that you can not connect a galvanized fitting or nipple to a copper fitting or the galvanized fitting will disintegrate in a matter of no time . ( this was my ah ha moment ) the fact that i had paid this company $ 275.00 on top of what the warranty company paid them . for the sum of $ 275.00 , i the home owner had to go behind this professional plumber and re-install new fitting / drain the water heater / go to lowe 's / and a plumbing supply store . to replace the bad parts . ( do not use this plumbing company what ever you do ) or you will be sorry . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . p.s - the city inspection was april 16/ 2014 , the inspector advised me that had i not ( changed the pipe fitting ) and they were leaking when he came to do the inspection of the water heater it would not have passed the inspection for a permit , and he said i should go after them ......... ( 0 star rateing ) .
1	i like the concept of a salon dedicated to waxing anything and everything . i normally take care of my eyebrows on my own because i am a perfectionist , but while moving i decided to try this place out . they did great . meticulous and precise and i never felt hustled to get anything else or buy product . i ended up getting more things done once i saw how clean and professional everyone was . i really like that they use hard wax and have a step by step process to clean before and soothe after . oh and first time guests get a free wax service . completely free . worth the trip if you are curious
0	was visiting the area on business and specifically looked for a cafe with organic menu items . the setting seems a world away from the city , but it took less than 10 minutes to get to the airport . parking signs direct cars to park across the street , so i did , but one can actually drive back to the morning glory cafe . i did n't mind the 4 minute walk as the grounds are beautiful . i sat on the patio overlooking the gardens . since the waitress asked if i wanted something to drink , i assumed she would provide it . she informed me that coffee , tea and lemonade were behind me and it was self serve . no biggy - but all the cups were disposable , including clear plastic cups for water ( not necessarily a huge deal if they did n't tout their recycling efforts and sustainability on the back of the menu ) . the coffee was very weak ... and i tried 2 different containers . boo ! service was good even with a packed patio . they did use their farm ingredients in many of the dishes . i ordered the white truffle scrambled egg & local veggie skillet , which came with sauteed cauliflower , peas , green beans , and a couple strips of spinach . the veggies were fresh , but the dish lacked flavor . maybe i was expecting some fresh herbs or more seasoning ? the setting is a 4 , the service is a 3-4 , but the food which is the most important part - a 3. i would go back to try one of the other two restaurants . lunch on the picnic benches or a nicer dinner at quiessence , with daily menu changes , sounds appealing .
1	i was admittedly nervous to try hot yoga again after having had a very negative experience on the west side about two years ago . . . but after talking with the instructors and founders , touring the gorgeous bamboo studio ( yay , no stinky carpet ! ) , and hearing about what makes the modo series different , i decided to give it a try . so far , i am thrilled , and trying to come as often as my schedule allows ! i 've had awesome classes so far with chip , mallory , and ashley . in fact i 'm headed to ashley 's noon class today . i particularly love the modo music class , as i think the music helps me ground and focus . i love that you not only start with savasana , but there is a brief savasana in the middle of the series , too . . . and a final , luxurious savasana at the end where you can take your time absorbing the benefits of your yoga session . the instructors do n't seem to mind when i modify the positions for my body issues , and they are good about offering alternatives and suggestions for using the blocks , which is a relief . the studio itself is super cute . everything is made from upcycled materials . they are really dedicated to keeping the studio clean and sanitized , and i 've seen the floors get sanitized after every class . most of all the staff and instructors are warm and welcoming , and i have n't run into the enormous attitude you encounter at some studios ! i knew ashley from her outside om project , which involves donation-based yoga in the parks and open spaces , and i am happy to report that the same down-to-earth energy has successfully transferred into a sweet studio space !
0	i am officially missing the boat on the big deal on three amigos . always crowded whenever normal people eat , the service leaves everything and my mother to be desired . i understand that they 're probably nice people but during my latest ( abeit , 5th ) attempt at giving three amigos a shot , they took over 30 minutes to get me 1 beer and forgot our appetizer for our table entirely . the food is ok , but that 's coming from someone who loves mexican food so i 'm always wild about everything because how can you not love any and everything mexican ? this is where the problemo lies - theyr ' e just not doing anything great at three amigos . i got the taco salad and in the past have tried the enchiladas verde , nachos and fajitas and all are - eh . the bathrooms - ick ! they get less attention that the tables , so needless to say on busy nights they 're not visions of cleanliness . part of me just wants to love all over some three amigos because i love east charlotte and love mexican food and love establishments that love yelp , but three amigos , i sadly will say adios and go to you no longer .
0	i visited scramble for breakfast with a group of coworkers and i was n't really impressed . the food came out fast but the taste was just ok and i felt i paid too much money for it ; at least the americano coffee was the best part of my meal . so i thought ok let me give the `` popular item '' , the cinnamon roll , a chance . that was a disappointment since the frosting was cream cheese and i had to scrape off the mountain of it . i suggest they notate on the menu that the cinnamon roll comes with cream cheese frosting since they typically come with vanilla icing . over all the customer service better than the food .
0	the service and hospitality was the worst we have experienced . when our group of four arrived at 7:30pm tonight the hostess seating us took us to be seated and then said she made a mistake and we would have to follow her back to the front desk . once back to the front another group of four just walked in and was promptly seated by another hostess as we waited for our hostess to seat us she then informed us we would have to wait as no other tables were available . i asked our hostess why the group of four who came in after us why they were able to get seated and we were not . she snipped that 's just the way thing 's go sometimes ! just then a table did open up and we were seated at a dirty table . they cleaned it off and asked what we would like to drink . we all ordered water and our waitress said she would be with us in a minute . after ten minutes our waitress came back to take our order . we proceeded to order the prime rib and she informed our group they were out of prime rib . i asked our waitress why she did n't inform us the prime rib was not available prior to the wait on her return to take our order and she quickly responded in a very loud and rude voice '' i do n't know what your going to order '' i quickly responded that it would be nice to know what is available prior to looking over the menu and making a decision on what is on the menu and then to be rudely informed what 's on the menu is not available ! we promptly left and headed to the texas roadhouse on gilbert and germaine . the staff was very courtious the manager was very visibly present and the hostess seated us and informed us they were currently out of chilli but would have more in ten minutes . when our waitress came to ask what we wanted to drink she to informed us of the chilli as well as the remaining prime rib . we will not be patronizing the texas roadhouse on power and ray ! ! !
0	wish there were stars in the negative . i actually had geico insurance until they scammed me and did the same with 4 others that i know of . basically ; i put my payment on auto for ease and simply made sure i always had money to cover the payment . one day i get stoped by the police because `` your registration has been suspended due to lack of payment '' . well i only found this out after geico had suspended it without notifing me by mail or phone call . so ; i go to the dmv only to find out it will cost 750.00 to reinstate the registration and i will be listed as a high risk driver which will raise my rates . when i asked geico why they did n't call me the response was `` that is a luxury that we do if we have time '' . now if that was n't bad enough geico is trying to collect money on that time they suspended my registration . bottom line is this ; insurance company 's all quote rates which tend to be almost identical to each other . so ; why take the risk with geico and becaome another victim of their scam ?
1	best sandwich in town ... new jersey all the way
0	one of our close family friends loves this restaurant and will celebrate her birthday and other special family events here throughout the year . it 's a decent place to take your family for dinner or lunch . since they know our friends well , we get great service every time . the cheese crisps and beef burritos are pretty good .... as a matter of fact , this is where i had my first cheese crisp ever a few years ago . the complimentary chips & salsa is ok. the salsa is very mild , you have to request a spicy one if that 's your deal .... i ask every time . if you 're in the area , it 's not a bad choice for a family night out . return factor - 75 %
0	i got 2 boba drinks . coconut milk tea and a honeydew melon smoothie . the smoothie tasted like blended ice with a hint of melon flavor . the coconut milk tea was good and i ca n't complain about it . but this place can not prepare boba for shit . the boba was so hard in the middle and they sweetened them as well . you are adding them to a sweet drink , more sugar on the boba is the last thing you need . the boba was actually sweeter than the watered down smoothie actually . i am willing to still try their food one day but if you are looking for good boba on the east side , do n't stop here .
0	overall , the singing and dancing were great . the star singer/performer ms. reeves sounded fantastic , but was way over the top with her mannerisms as she tried to mimic tina tuner and diana ross . it was practically mockery . if it had not been for her buffoonery , i 'd have given this show a 4 .
1	went back yet again for another touch up for my `` ombre '' fade from my natural ( black ) to light brown . this time i was unable to book my appointment with emily b. so instead she suggested i go with roxanne . roxy was amazing ! she did a wonderful job weaving the ombre into my hair that had already been treated to daken back to my original color ( due to previously having highlights ) . she gently handled my hair professionally and perfectly . emily b. was able to complete the look with a face flattering cut ( as per usual ) and i am extremely appreciative . these ladies know their stuff , execute it well , are friendly , considerate of their customers ' needs/wants , and have wonderful personalities too ! thanks again to the root for another awesome job and great service ! : )
0	if you have time to leisurely stroll to your gate , enjoy the free wi-fi and/ or ponder your upcoming trip while sitting in the plethora of rocking chairs ... then this is the airport for you . good restaurants , decent shopping and clean . ( 4.5 stars for this section ) if however , you are using this as a connecting airport , just flying through ... and you have a tight connection then this is the worst hub airport -- ever . if you come into a b gate and have your next flight leaving out of e concourse you will not make it unless you have a solid 20 minutes to walk ( fast ) there . seriously it 's halfway to raleigh ... ( 1 star for this section ) us airways plans these connections very aggressively . and , it never fails ... the tighter your connection the more likely your next flight will be at that furthest location . so a solid 3 stars .
1	i worked with mark to find a new place for me and my girlfriend to live and we knew exactly what we were looking for . mark was very informative and provided great insight about the different area 's in town . he found a place for us within a week ! ! ! he gave us a ton of options and was very helpful . i highly recommend working with mark marcus ! he is very committed to his work and very good at it . you ca n't put a price on a trustworthy realtor who truly wants the best for you . great experience ! ! !
1	remarkable structure and even more remakable setting . our family arrived on a late , warm , cloudless midweek afternoon . not too many people . the setting sun created constantly changing colours and shadows through the outdoor sculptures and trees onto the soft stone building surfaces . such is the site of this museum , we enjoyed the views of la and the exterior drama so much we barely had time for the exhibits inside . the vision to build it matches the vision it provides . must see experience ..
1	chile roast beef tacos were excellent ! daughter loved that you could make a ton of different drinks . suggest going on taco tuesday ... taco 's 1.00 off
1	we were meeting friends to see a show at the cockroach theater , and bar + bistro is just steps away , so they suggested it , though none of us had every been there before . interesting setup : booths with art palette tables in the smaller dining room , which are creative but require the agility of a contortionist if you 're on the inside , and regular tables in the larger main dining room . i liked the juxtaposition of art vs industry in the two arrangements , and also being `` forced '' to walk through the art gallery to use the ladies ' room . our server was very attentive , and came back several times before i could settle on what i wanted to eat . hubby and i shared a roasted tomato soup ; it was delicious , but i was glad we were sharing it , because i try to stay away from cream soups . our friends shared the butternut squash soup . for as much time as i spent studying the menu , i did n't notice it ! i surely would have ordered it , since it was served in the squash and they got to eat that , too . i had the hot pastrami sandwich on marbled rye , despite the fact that it was advertised with spicy mojo mayo , a travesty in my religion , which decrees it should come with deli mustard . the pastrami was lean , a bit dry ( that 's because pastrami is supposed to be fatty ) , and i did n't notice the mojo mayo . while i enjoyed it overall , it would have been better if the rye had been grilled . what i loved was the salad that came with the sandwich - fresh greens , a goodly helping of cubed avocado , and very good citrus dressing which , for once , was n't too vinegary for my taste . my husband had the chicken club , which he ate with gusto , and though i 'm not a big fan of sweet potato fries , his were fabulous , and i pilfered more than one . our friends shared the paella . they had no complaints , but if i 'd paid 32 bucks for that small portion ( which was the entree size ) , i 'd have been very pissed . i was the only one who ordered wine , my usual riesling , but this one , a california , was too dry for my taste . overall , a nice meal with good service , and it sure was conveniently located .
1	what a cute little arizona coffee shop . i loved the northwest feel of the place but the country music in the background made it truly arizona . took a friend here because it was the closest decent coffee place close to her house . this place was a great find . i had the multigrain waffles with a coffee and she had an egg sandwich with mocha . we both enjoyed our food . the waffles were hearty and the coffee had good flavor ( aka not burnt like starbucks ) . we also used the yelp deal which made our meal extremely affordable . but even without the coupon , things are decently priced . the owner seemed like a nice guy .
0	so coke is coke and i like it as soda goes . but this place they have set up is n't about how great the product is . we know how it is . this is about the experience and having fun . i came here with 2 other adults and 4 kids ranging from 3 to 12 and while some of our group went to find seats a few of us stayed to order . the kids wanted their own coke floats and we wanted to try the combo special which includes the around the world sampler and the float sampler . this sampler has 32 samples all together . a lot of soda ? yes . but it 's not about finishing it all but trying them . the girl taking our order seemed very annoyed with the fact that we ordered so much soda , probably because we would n't finish it . of course we are n't going to finish it ! most of it tasted too weird for us anyways . it 's to try and experience something different . she kept deterring us from getting it , even when i just told her to give it to us . we eventually ordered it from another person but we were pretty aggravated initially bc of this girl . so . service was abominable . but the world sampler was fun .
0	their products are great , a little pricey , but great . the sales-associates are pushy & ask you to try everything in the store , and it gets a little old . most women just like to shop & not be bothered , but this is not a store you can do that in .
1	this is the lone nc outpost of this 17 unit chain that got its start in dallas , tx . razzoos provides your typical casual dining experience in d\u00e9cor , service , and food quality , but with a cajun twist . our server was fun loving with a good knowledge of the restaurant 's beer selection . we were greeted as soon as we walked in the door , seated immediately , and our order was taken soon after . we started with the alligator appetizer . as many others have mentioned , this item is not on the menu , but is very popular . it consists of fried breaded bits of alligator ( about the size of popcorn chicken ) served with a few french fries in a basket . it comes with a spicy cocktail sauce to dip . the server suggested that i order the crawfish etouffee and i was not disappointed . a generous portion of shelled crawfish are covered with a spicy brown roux sauce with a mountain of moist dirty rice in the middle . adding some of the hot sauce from the table made it just the right temperature . if you find yourself by the mall , but do n't want to try the same old boring chain , check out razzoo 's . it wo n't be an authentic cajun experience , but it will be delicious and who has time to go to new orleans anyway ?
0	if i could give this place no stars - i would do it . i was in the store with my parents trying to help them find an entertainment center . so we find a couple here we like and we 're looking at them - out of nowhere here comes overzealous employee . we 're opening the doors and he shouts `` that is n't how the doors work ! '' so he takes it upon himself to show us how the doors work while scolding us for trying to open it . keeping in mind we 're looking at items that cost over $ 3,000 each . so finally we move to the door but notice a $ 15 item we like , a doormat . the doormat on top has a frayed edge so we look to get one from the middle of the pile and here comes overzealous employee again - immediately asking us why we ca n't buy the one on top . horrible experience of harassment by a guy with glasses . we wo n't ever be going back to this store and i can see why no one is ever buying anything in there .
1	* * * this gas station and convenience store is right off the freeway ; their gas is a little cheaper than a lot of the california gas stations that are in more isolated areas just off the freeway ( like off the 5 freeway from los angeles to san francisco ) ; circle k is a big gas station and it is easy getting in and out of * * * this gas station features several free parking spaces if you are just looking to grab something in circle k 's convenience store ; circle k is kind of known in certain areas to be like am/pm or 7-eleven so it might be worth checking out .
0	the positives : prime rib , kalbi , ox tail soup , wine & beer included in the price . the negatives : all the seafood tasted old . the crawfish tasted especially bad . overall , i would not come back even for the price they are offering for this buffet .
0	my stay was less than stellar . the staff was aloof , minus one really nice bell boy trying to help everyone . i stood at the check in desk while 1 employee shuffled papers without acknowledging me . i figured he was n't checking people in , but then after a few minutes he looked up and asked if i was checking in . room was nice , but just had a scuffed up old fridge in the corner of the room on the floor . stood out next to the nice decor . i did n't have a room service menu in the room , didnt have a hair dryer . when i went to the bar after a long day of work , the bartender moved me away from the bar saying the other guest next to me has had too much to drink . i guess i appreciated the gesture , but how about sending him to his room or home instead of letting him take up valuable space at the bar ? i ordered my drink from the server . waited about 15 mins as she passed by a few times . ( there were only 3 other single tables in the whole place ) so i just got up and left . she looked at me as i did and said nothing . customer service is everything these days and they were really lacking . i went to a hotel bar across the street the next night and had amazing attentive service . maybe next time ill stay there to get a little more attention when paying $ 200+ a night .
1	another excellent byob in mtl , but expect a lineup if it 's nice out . they 're known for their 5 cheese pizza , so definitely give it a try ... but it 's actually too cheesy for me to have on it 's own . it pairs nicely with the pesto so i 'd recommend getting those two and splitting with a friend ( or friends ) . the pepperoni pizza 's pretty perfect too . none of them get soggy in the middle , the dough is both airy and crispy ... my mouth is watering just thinking about it ...
1	came here around 6:30 on a sunday night and the wait was 90 minutes . alaskan king crab legs , prime rib , veal , huge shrimp , and stations dedicated to different types of cuisine ( american , italian , asian , cold seafood , warm seafood , etc . ) they have the most variety i 've even seen at a buffet , and believe me , i 've been to my share of buffets ( i 'm filipino ) two types of veal , scallop ceviche , rock shrimp ceviche , gazpacho , gnocchi , udon noodles , herb crusted salmon in miso broth with shitake mushrooms , pear , walnut and gorgonzola salad ... really atypical buffet fare . they had a guy making fresh sugar crusts on creme brulees . yummmmm . their mango sorbet is made there daily , an their lemon froyo was good too .
1	my family always enjoys getting breakfast at crackers & company . my son loves the big fluffy waffles so his 12 year old taste . my wife always enjoys the '222 ' and i always get the breakfast burrito . the serving sizes are always generous and the prices are fair for the portion size . the atmosphere is always friendly and the service is always very attentive .
0	food is consistent . they updated which is nice . not happy that every table is dirty and so is the floor .
1	went to vanity nightclub on may , 6th . it was a sunday night and the last night of my vegas bachelor party weekend . me and 5 other guys hit up this club on the advice of red carpet vip . we did bottle service walked right pass the line . the club was pretty tight . music was great ... techno/top 40 remixs . the dance floor seemed to be hoppin . i stayed in my private table and danced the night away . my friends really enjoyed themselves and the scenery was n't bad . overall a great ending to an awesome vegas weekend .
0	being from east mesa i am spoiled by waldo 's , so i hoped this place might be comparable . i was pretty disappointed . i tried their original and sweet bbq sauces and they both tasted the same ( and not very sweet at all ) . on top of that i found a thin piece of plastic wrap in my sandwich ... i would return for the mac and cheese , free ice cream and friendly service , but not much else .
1	my husband is a marine , and since we needed to do a `` staycation '' instead of a honeymoon for now , we stayed at the orange tree for his 10 leave . it was so amazing ! pros : the rooms were clean and spacious , with huge bathrooms , a jacuzzi tub , a big walk-in shower , and the most amazing bed in the entire world . there were flat screens in the living room and bedroom , and a full sized fridge to store our leftovers and drinks . the pool area was really nice , with a pool bar . we had a spacious patio that overlooked the golf course . also , the staff were soooo nice ! it felt like everyone went out of their way to make us feel special . it felt like home towards the end of our stay ! : ) cons : there were only 2 : we stayed in building 6 , which was a pretty far walk from the parking lot . if this is a problem for you , i 'd recommend staying in buildings 1-4 . ( but we were close to the pool ) . also , the doors to the bedroom were n't solid doors , but those kind with the slots in them . it provided privacy , but when my husband stayed up later than i did one night when his buddies came over , i could hear everything as if i were still sitting on the couch hanging out with them . ( i wound up just getting up and rejoining the conversation , cuz it felt like i was eavesdropping lol ) so , if noise privacy is an issue for you between the bedroom and living room , i 'd keep that in mind ! overall , since parking and the non-doors on the bedroom were the only problems , i would recommend this place to everyone and everyone ! ! we 're going to go back every time we 're able to visit the scottsdale area ! : )
0	not bad . a tad overpriced for the food you receive . they seem to use the same ingredients for all the rolls . i 've only been here twice , and it never sticks out in my mind . it is in a convenient location since it is right across the street from the harkins movie theater . there are definitely better restaurants around in the area .
1	trevi is a eatery located caesar 's palace , it has a small replica of the same name fountain in rome . the forum shops is the first shopping mall in vegas , many imitated , none duplicated ! trevi is located in the middle of the mall . we stopped by for a quick bite between activities , the staff was courteous and quick . the minestrone soup was good and lightly seasoned , i hate when it 's the other way . my daughter had the italian chopped salad , it was good . prices were reasonable unlike most vegas places , a good value
1	i work for a christian campus ministry , and my organization often brings me to madison . while in town , i often crave some east asian food , and wah kee hit the spot . a friend and i enjoyed both the charsiu-wonton noodle soup and the beef-chive-gyoza soup . i agree with wendy h that for madison , this restaurant is 4 stars , but if it were in the bay area , it 'd get 3 stars .
0	my mom and i were in a last-minute need for a specialty cake for my dad 's birthday . because of our time crunch ( one week 's notice ) , we really did n't have a choice on where to take our business and thus we ended up at let them eat cake . the customer order/pick-up area is combined with their cupcake counter making this place extremely compact . regardless , the space was clean and they did manage to fit two , slim , high top tables on which were books filled with pictures of previous cake designs , most not being as intricate as we were wanting . an employee name katie was there to greet us and help us determine the cake specifications . she was very helpful with educating us on what types of frosting would be better for our design . she informed us of using the risk of staining ( the teeth and lips ) when using dark colors with a buttercream frosting . because of that new knowledge we opted for the fondant which does n't leave a stain even when using black dyes . the cake was big enough to feed 30 people and after we got over the `` sticker shock '' we submitted the order . our event was on sunday and since their weekend hours are non-existent we had to pick up the cake by 11 am on saturday . this was a little frustrating because we had to find a refrigerator big enough to keep the cake in , as well as , keep it hidden so my dad would n't find it early . they did a decent job with the design , there was one error with the coloring , but they were able to fix that up on the spot and no additional charge . the cake was pretty tasty , nothing spectacular , but the guests and and my dad were impressed with the design . it might just be knowing how much it cost that ruined the design aspect for both my mother and myself , but since the guests were happy , we were happy .
1	i went back to naked city pizza shop inside of moondoggies again to eat more of their menu , and as before i was not disappointed . this time i had the pizza , it was a big square slice of pepperoni pizza , the crust not too thick and not too thin , kind of like handtossed at most major pizza places , but it 's actually good , not processed frozen dough that the big guys have . i am a pretty big eater and i have to say that it was a bit of work to get through the slice , let 's just say that it 's not a small slice ! ! ! i also gave the pizza logs another chance , last time they were a little chilly in the middle , this time they came out piping hot , after a little cooling , they were amazing ... could be one of my favorite apps in town ... imagine if a totino 's pizza roll and an egg roll had a delicious baby . i also tried one of their chicken fingers , it was crispy and delicious , they have added chicken finger tacos to the menu , one member of my group had one , and let 's just say it 's on my list to try next time . this place is really starting to grow on me , the staff is nice , the bar is a great little dive bar , and the food is amazing . i only wish it was closer to my house
0	my first time at leslie 's . it 's close to home which is a plus . the place was empty the entire time i was there , they are tucked in tiny strip mall which is in a weird spot , but i pass it all the time and noticed the nail spa sign . i was greeted and taken care of right away . chris did my pedicure and gel manicure . i opted for the 35 $ upgraded pedi since it had been a while and my feet needed some pampering . it was awesome , i almost fell asleep a few times ! the gel manicure went well too , they do n't have tons of colors and ca n't do a lot of the fancy art like some of the places in town . chris did a great job , he chatted and joked with me at times and knew when to not talk so i could enjoy the experience . prices are pretty much on par with most places . everything was clean , i saw him open new sterilized instruments from their packages . i will probably go back again .
1	we took our valet 's advice and hit up this local las vegas spot . we were served quickly and both enjoyed out delicious omelet 's . we will definitely hit it up again next time .
0	how things have changed since our favorite server left more than a year ago . i used to swear by this place & told many how great it was but that was then . it has been almost a year since i 've been back due to the last few times having been pretty bad . the food was just not the same & the service was shotty .
0	this is nothing like the hamburger spots in la . i got a breakfast burrito & it was awful . just greasy & did n't even taste like it had any salt or other seasonings . i thought ok u have salsa & peppers that will make it better , wrong ! how do you even make salsa with no taste ! i will not be going back & wasting my money .
0	wow i got a email from a worker from this place ! i shall not go back there i was not planning on it ! i was told if i wanted beer or wine go somewhere eles ! wow it looks like i am going to have to block this person !
0	never seen a bar ( especially a hotel bar ) so anxious to close checks and have patrons go away . happened to me both at lunch and dinner ; i watched same happen all around me . too bad because beer selection was good and atmosphere was inviting . would have otherwise enjoyed spending more time and money here .
0	in a sea of bars and restaurant in pittsburgh it 's hard to stand out and i think urban tap has done that . they have an impressive draft list , a decent whiskey list , and good foods to back it all up . the `` bro bros '' and i went here for a beer to catch up and we had a pretty good time . i got the `` chevre and jam '' burger which was really good . i mean how can you go wrong with jam and goat cheese . the burger was very meat ballish . i do n't know how they cooked the burger all the way through when it was practically a ball but they did . i 'm not the biggest fan of ball like burgers but it was good so no complaints i guess . the only bone i have to pick with urban tap is with their whiskey . their more modestly price whisky 's were around 6-7 bucks . above the section it said `` neat '' and then in parenthesis it said `` ( there is a $ 2 up charge for on the rocks ) '' so i thought fine , neat is 7 on the rocks is 9. fair enough . not so according to the waitress . all their whiskey 's apparently are served as shots . so the price you see is the shot price . there is an up charge for both the neat and on the rocks pours . after being told that `` she did n't write the menu '' she removed the 6 dollars of up charges that she had once added . i do n't think it helped that we had been drinking or that we pointed out that they spelled `` bulleit '' bourbon wrong on the menu . the whisky has an `` i '' where the thing that is fired out of a gun does not . what fine dining and gastropub sells all their whiskey as shots . who is ordering shots of fine whiskey ? i have a feeling there is a misunderstanding as to how the pours and charges are suppose to go , but you might want to ask before ordering some . either that or they want the perception of affordable whiskey by only displaying the shot price then up charging you when you order it any other way .
1	after eating korean food , we felt like having a dessert . we came here on a wednesday evening and got 2 ordered of small shaved snow 1. mucho mango with mochi 2. vanilla shaved snow with strawberry , condensed milk , and mochi for $ 9.80 - friendly service . free samples . - finally ! the closest shaved snow las vegas has to class 302. but hands down , not better than 302 . - needs more helping of condensed milk . needs more squirts . haha . - fresh fruits . not mushy . - natural ingredients ! - mochi like yogurt land . - cashier hooked it up with 2 extra stamps on accident ? ! haha - red bean paste ? fail . do n't get the green tea . - summed up as an americanized version ( fruity pebbles ? ! haha ) of taiwanese shaved snow .
0	after reading all the reviews i thought i would give vince a shot at cleaning our house windows and screens . although i like vince and his assistant as nice guys and they clean the windows well , all my screens are bent and do not fit like they did prior to them working on the windows . i walked around the house and found two screws that they dropped and did not put in the screens . i have several screens that are showing big gaps and one that got forced in and is pretty bent now . looks like it is going to cost me to have them reframed down the road .
1	loved it ! the chocolate and banana shake was delicious . kid approved too via my three yr old daughter . soooo many flavors will have to stop by soon !
0	with a quick layover in phoenix , i did some research and found there was a vegan-friendly mexican eatery right in the airport . blue burrito grille is its name and lard-free beans are its game . it offered a limited menu in the airport that included breakfast , burritos , favorites , and salads . i went with the vegetarian burrito with no-lard black beans , grilled peppers & onions , lettuce , and guacamole . i added the guacamole and asked them to hold the cheese . with it , they gave me some of the tappato `` hot '' sauce . the burrito really was n't that good , but i was happy to have a real meal . the beans and veggies were pretty flavorless and the hot sauce was n't that great either . and there was so little guacamole that it did n't add much to the meal . that said , if i 'm ever in this airport again , i 'd eat here again because the options are limited and this sure was better than nothing .
1	everyone was so nice . as soon as i walked in i was greeted . so much nicer than lvac . i went to cary for a fitness evaluation . he was extremely knowledgable and helpful .
1	my dear pita jungle : you always make me so happy when i eat here ! i leave so stuffed , but i ca n't get enough of your food . if it were n't for your falafel , i would have given you 5 stars . i really do n't like it , because it is too crusty for my tastes . however , your hummus is some of the best around and i really love your broiled chicken pita/broiled chicken salad . my sister always enjoys your cheesecake after her meal , as well . it makes me smile to see that the servers can wear virtually anything they want . besides that , i 've never once had bad service .
0	the woman who threaded my brows was very rude . i told her i just wanted them shaped , and to keep the natural thickness . she did n't say `` ok '' or anything , she just kind of nodded her head and grunted . she made them much thinner than i like . she also made my brows to entirely different shapes ! she chopped off half my brow on the left side , and gave me a very dramatic arch on the right side . it also hurt a lot more than threading normally does . i was a lot redder than usual , and even bleeding a tiny bit . i ca n't believe i actually paid for it , i should have refused . on the bright side , it was only 10 dollars .
0	i am at a loss on why people like to come here . first and foremost , patrons are required to walk through the bar which has cigarette smells that have been here for 40 years . it is disgusting . i 've been there twice and there were several old worn out bar patrons that probably occupy a stool every day . that is the biggest turnoff for me once behind the door to the small restaurant , it 's quirky to say the lest . the service was very good and friendly . the food was good and arrived quickly . i had a patty melt and it was delicious and juicy and served on marble rye . i am a loss to figure out whey when there are so may choices in lv for restaurant and folks would choose to go to four kegs . this confirms that there is a lid for every pot an it takes all kinds of places to make the world happy . i 'd never chose to go here , but if a group wanted to go i would hold my nose to get into the restaurant and have some good food . this is certainly not a place fork people who want to eat healthy .
0	seems like a pretty friendly shop . one technician and one front desk woman were on duty and i was in and out in about 20 minutes , even with two cars already in the bay . the price was $ 30 and used the yelp check-in for a $ 4 discount on the first change . of course there was the air filter pitch as well , but this woman explained ( nobody in like 100 jiffy lube oil changes ever did ) , why i need a new one ? unless she was pulling the wool over my head , it appeared to be a logical explanation . that was about 15 bucks . only problem is that they don ; 't email or appear to offer any coupons or discounts for future oil changes . still , it was a good enough experience that i will go back , even though they do n't really clean windows or do anything extra or at least tell you about things they did do .
1	great pesto chicken sandwich and the white chocolate brownie explosion cake was one of the best cakes i have ever had ! i would highly recommend this , especially for dessert !
1	ok , i have been coming to this dog park for about 8 months now . i love it , and my golden sasha loves it too . the one and only complaint that i have , is the irrigation . the irrigation is a pain , but only during the summer months . the city closes the park about two times a month , with each closure lasting up to a full week to allow the water from the irrigation to dry , leaving myself and about a hundred other pet owners to flock a different park . unfortunately , even if you wanted to deal with the muddy situation , you ca n't . the city locks the gates until the grounds are dried . coming here regularly for about 8 months , i 've learned lots of dog names , but not too many owners name , but then again , the dog park is for dogs , not us humans right ? ok , the ameneties to this park , are two water stations , plenty of seating , lots of shade , and a huge play area . you will not find a better park than this .
0	this is not southern style brisket . it 's chewy and fatty ( i found three large chunks of fatty brisket that somebody could choke on if they tried to swallow it ) . listen , i ate at 36 real southern bbq joints last summer and this brisket would rank last . website says he is from arkansas , but i would like proof because the brisket does n't qualify as southern . you can tell by the way he chops it , real bbq brisket is more shredded . he also should know nobody serves brisket on a hoagie roll in the south , it comes on a bun . rollin smoke has two sauces , one claims to be hot , but both taste exactly the same , nothing stands out in that respect . moving onto the side dish , which is in a tiny cup and not worth the $ 2 . it was jalapeno coleslaw and was n't too bad , but i honestly did n't see any jalapeno 's in the cup . it also appears he has changed the prices - up of course - after being open a week . the online menu says a combo includes drink , chips and side for $ 2 , now the chips are excluded . the price of 1/2 rack of ribs is $ 10 online and $ 12 on another menu that is off to the side inside the place , but on the official menu it is now $ 16 . the big smoker on the outside and good smell makes this place appealing to the eyes and nose , but it does n't pass the taste test . if you do go , show the website coupon on your phone to save 10 percent and that way when you get home and eat your nasty brisket at least you will have saved some money and wo n't feel as bad .
0	i agree with the previous poster . i have been going to snf & a about a year and a half now ( every 8 to 10 weeks ) , and have never gotten in on time . they are historically very late ... and even one time a pharmaceutical rep came in , told the receptionist she was there for her `` business appointment '' at 4 pm ... and yes , she got in on time . meanwhile , me with my 3:30 appointment was still waiting in the waiting room ! my other issue with this place is that they need a better cleaning crew . i realize it 's `` just feet '' .... but i do n't like being in any doctor 's office and seeing cobwebs and dirty floors . it just does n't seem right . on the plus side , the doctors are friendly and knowledgeable . however , the remaining admin staff ... need some serious lessons in customer service and friendliness .
0	very disappointed .. i am part of the vip membership club i tried to plan a party and never heard anything back .. our drinks took forever .. food was decent .. the server said the vip host would come talk to me about the issue with the party and she never did .. we were over charged for a drink and their specialty drinks sucked .. i never finished either one of mine .. i ordered 2 and the server never asked if anything was wrong .. it was a girls night and there were 6 of us and none of us will ever come back and will tell our friends about it .............
0	sandcastle water park in p-burgh was just `` okay '' for me . i really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or `` family '' because there is n't much fun here for people older than 16. the water slides here were lacking . there were very few of them and the majority of them are boring . the last time i was there ( not too long ago ) there were n't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide , so they really have some updating to do . they do have an `` adult pool '' and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area . the pool is very small , similar to one you 'd find at a hotel chain . it has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max . and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in . it was n't too impressive to me . they also have a lazy river at this park and , while i do enjoy lazy rivers , this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe . people kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out . the one attraction that i did enjoy was the wave pool . it was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably . the water was nice and clean ( a big plus ) and the wave action was strong . i could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park . overall , this place is just mediocre . it does n't `` wow '' me very much but if you live in the area , have kids , and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall , it 'll provide them with a lot of fun .
1	amazing place . delicious food , ice cream , and fruit flavored waters . my number one go to ice cream place
0	no stars actually ! ! ! do not come here for dim sum ! ! ! ! i repeat ... do not ! my family and i frequent this place regularly for dim sum . but yesterday was the last and dual final time i will be coming here . 1st - they now charge $ 1 per person for tea , which normally i would n't mind , i understand tea gets expensive and can add up . but the jasmine tea tasted like hot water with a hint of color to it , no jasmine taste what so ever . service is slow and servers all looked unhappy . i 'm chinese , and trust me i 'm used to asian restaurants with bad or no service , it just comes with dining at an asian restaurant . especially chinese . but this has got to be the worst i 've had in a long time . sat down , was asked what kind of tea would you like . not aware $ 1 per person . i ordered the stream rice rolls with cilantro n green onion with the server . 15 minutes went by , not a single food cart . entire restaurant 4 carts , steam cart , congee cart , miscellaneous food , and chinese broccoli cart . the ladies were pushing them like the wheels were broken or something ! finally the stream cart came by . we ordered 8 dishes my mom , boyfriend , n myself ) figured we load up since it took so long . the same cart with the same food came by 3 times after that , no new items . i asked for steamed tripe , and shrimp rice rolls and she looked around at the other carts and said `` i do n't have it . '' i finally get my order of cilantro and green onion rice roll , only to see a plan ol ' plate of steam rolls , no herb . i told the lady i wanted cilantro n green onion . she walked up to the waitress that i placed my order with and told her next time not to write the word white in the order , white means plan . the waitress then comes over to the table and says , `` the lady just started working a few days ago so she made the mistake . we have to make your another one . '' in the meantime , no other carts came by but the 4 carts that had nothing that sparked my interest . asked for egg custard tarts , nothing . not a single one to be found . as time pasted , i got more and more frustrated as i watched the lady bring out cilantro green onion rice rolls to all the other tables that were seated after us ! the table next to us had 5 orders of egg tarts delivered to their table . so i decided to place one order and ask for the check ... we were fed up at this point . the waitress took the check to tally up and added the order of egg custard to the bill . she came back and said 15 minutes wait for the egg tarts . so damn frustrated i said no ! i ca n't wait anymore , i have to leave now ( by now it 's 90 minutes ) . she walked away , went up to the cashier , came back n said ok 6 minutes ok because she already added the tarts on your bill . i finally said fine and agreed . 15 minutes later ... no tart in sight and the waitress kept dodging our table because she knew i was trying to get her attention . finally got her attention and she went to get them . i felt played for a fool . $ 50 later and we were all still some what hungry . because of this almost 2 hour lunch , i was almost late to work . never ever ever again ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	we were told that there would be a 30min wait for a party of 2. we were told that we could wait in the bar area , but not at the tables . the bar itself was full , so we were forced to stand by the window next to the bus staff trays full of dirty dishes . we were eventually seated in the main dining area where the acoustics were so bad that we could n't hear our server . we ordered the surf and turf skewers , and none of the shrimp were de-veined . the prep cook apparently sliced all of the shrimp down the wrong side , leaving the waste vein intact . we also ordered the almond stuffed dates , and one of the five dates contained a date pit rather than an almond . it seemed as though the kitchen staff had no knowledge of how to properly clean these two items . to top it off , a bachelorette party equipped with a male blowup doll were seated near us and across from a woman and a 10 year old or so boy . i know this is vegas , but there 's a time and place to allow that sort of thing . an all ages dining establishment during peak hours does n't seem like the best time or place .
0	stopped in for breakfast on a recommendation from some friends . the place was crowded but we were seated within 10 minutes of checking in . i had the eggs benedict . my first time ever trying the dish and i will need to try it elsewhere to see if i still dislike it . i could say that without ever having it before , i 'm sure it is suppose to have some flavor . the holandaise sauce was just a visual effect , nothing to it . every bite tasted like egg yolk and that 's it just bland as could be . the potatoes did have seasoning and flavor and are worth ordering . i felt it was overpriced as well . my wife had pancakes and 2 eggs ( sunnyside not over easy as ordered ) with bacon coffee and one orange juice ( i would of had another but the no one came back until we were finished ) and it was over $ 30 . no urgency on returning here .
0	this is not nobu 's . not close . it is not some $ 100/person high end sushi restaurant at one of the higher end hotels on the las vegas strip . no way . you know that sushi you buy in the deli section to take home from safeway ? that is probably a lot closer . sou desu ! ( translation : that 's right ! ) this sushi restaurant is within a block of unlv . so what do students value ? cheap food ! so this place specializes in not-so-good , but fairly cheap , sushi . it is korean owned , of course . but it has been here for many years , so somebody comes here regularly . my guess is starving students who want to splurge on sushi before or after finals . or if you blew all of your money at the tables or slots at that glitzy strip casino/hotel , then you probably have to tighten your belt and come here for sushi , right ? you can get enough to eat for $ 20 here . that will get you one dish at nobu 's .
0	after my lunch , it was time for dessert so i went to ghirardelli for a sundae . there 's $ 1 off any sundae with a yelp check in . when i saw the ocean beach . the menu describes it likes this : vanilla ice cream smothered with creamy caramel , freshly homemade hot fudge and sea salt . perfectly topped with whipped cream , creamy caramel , sea salt and a ghirardelli squares\u00ae milk chocolate . once i saw salt , i stopped reading and knew this was the one . i ordered , paid , and had a seat while the sundae was being made . within a few minutes , the sundae was brought to me in a plastic cup and the server held out a long plastic spoon being careful not to touch the spoon part . the sundae was very good and they did not spare the sea salt which is what i liked about the combination . the cup is not the most convenient way to eat this sundae and the spoon was a bit flimsy . the cup had chocolate on the bottom and the ice creamed packed in had almost solidified that part of the chocolate . do n't give up and do n't despair . push that flimsy spoon to its limit and get every bit of chocolate goodness out of the bottom of that cup . i found that i liked their previous location near harrahs better . the sundaes were in different containers and there was more to them . these sundaes are smaller and more expensive , this wo n't be i 'll stop i probably wo n't make again !
0	i have to agree with michael c , there 's nothing extreme here . the food was a-ok and better than mcwendyking 's . i did find the service and presentation fit the mold of other fast food joints and that 's not a good thing . one of the guys behind the counter was a persistent up-seller which quickly became annoying .
1	well , i tried a couple different hawaiian restaurants while in phoenix for my visit . being that i lived in hawaii and married into a local family , i think i 'm a pretty good judge of what hawaiian food should taste like . ono 's surpassed the other places by far . in fact i 'm not gon na even gon na write a review on the others . the chicken katsu is a `` must try '' by far the best in this city . the only reason they do n't get 5 stars is the katsu sauce is a bit watery for me , and it not like they make it in hawaii . and their mac salad is the best in phoenix .. nuff said ! ! they get a 4
0	it 's my first night here and if it was n't for the country music awards i would not be staying here ! the room is extremely dated , the beds are bowed in the middle , the tv has snow on 1/2 the channels . the room actually stinks so bad that i may not make it ! ( covered in perfume or something ) we ate dinner in the hooters restaurant and i will say that it was horrible ! the service was bad , the hostess was horrible ! when we left there were 25 people in line waiting to get a table when half the restaurant was empty ! ( this was at 8:15pm ) i can honestly say , i will never come here again !
1	walter g is right , the wings basically taste like sauce . but thats what they are famous for . they have about 20 or so different types of flavored wings , if you 're someone that likes to try little samplettes of different stuff , you can get the 24 wings and get 4 different flavors of wings and split it with a friend . i tried the carribean jerk , teriyaki , garlic parmasean , and asian spice . if you eat 12 of their 'blazin ' wings within 6 mins , you can get your picture on their wall . i feel like i can handle my heat pretty well , so i asked the server for a sample of the blazin sauce , and i 'd have to say that it is pretty spicey , but i feel like it was kind of hyped , it was expecting it to be way more spicier , so spicy where you ca n't taste if it is salty or flavored , its just straight spicy . it was actually pretty good tasting , i would try maybe one wing just to say that i tried it , but i would suggest you do it after you try all the other flavors , b/c i tried blazin before everything else , and everything else did n't seem spicy afterwards since your tastebuds are pretty muched seasoned to the spiciest one first . the caribbean jerk was pretty spicy good , it was an enjoyable reasonable kinda of spicy . blazin made the top of my nose sweat a little . hahaha garlic parmasean pretty much tastes like garlic bread but in the chicken form . teryiaki was good b/c it was nice and sweet and made the chicken kinda caramelized . asian pretty much tasted like sweet and sour sauce but with some chili pepper . mango jabanero was n't as spicy as i thought it would be , it was kinda good b/c it was nice and sweet and mangoey . the onion rings were pretty good , it comes with liek a chipotle mayo sauce , and the small size , the portion size was pretty good for what you pay for . i thought everything was resonably priced and tasted pretty good . the restaurant is pretty big , there is no wait , and its open 24 hrs . they have tons of sports playing everywhere , we stayed after our meal was over to watch the new american gladiators on the huge projection screen ( only one that has sound ) . other screens are on mute . service was good , all the servers are girls in t heir 20 's in football jersey type shirts . pretty quick with your requets for more water when your mouth is on fire . their dessert menu is not that great , we opted not to get dessert there b /c nothing sounded very tantalizing .
1	this was my first time seeing a new dentist and after 26 years i was a little anxious to say the least . the entire team welcomed me and made me feel like i had known them for years . thanks guys ! ! although i 'm bummed i need some fillings i 'm not nervous to come back next week ! see you then !
0	i took my daughter here for some braids done by mary and they did n't even last two weeks , never again ! ....
0	food was so-so . service was ok waitress charged one of our breakfast orders as all side orders which cost an extra $ 13 over the menu price but i was in too much of a hurry to make a fuss .
1	we order from here very regularly . their $ 6 large cheese pizza deal is great . the sauce is fresh and sweet . most certainly a great improvement from other pizza places $ 5 pizza deals on campus . their other menu items are a little overpriced in my opinion . once i got mozzarella sticks and cheesy garlic bread , which were both very tasty but a little too much cost-wise for me to order those from there again .
1	i have n't had much middle eastern/indian food at all and very unfamiliar with it all . i went in for a donner kebab and ordered the wrong thing ( i know i 'm a novice ) . i ca n't remember what i got but it was spicy , rich and cooked perfectly . not to mention the naan bread was cooked fresh in the back and was to die for . it does get busy but it only shows how good it truly is . reasonably priced for the quality too ! i ca n't wait to go back !
1	the food was excellent . i tried the cranberry mojito and it was so good .
1	i had the beet salad and it was delicious ! my girlfriend had the kale ceaser and that was even better ! something about the honey-dijon dressing had me at hello . the only thing that i was dissapointed on was the service . the cashier that took my order was quite rude .
1	good selection of tea , plentiful seating , nice atmosphere . i had an iced hibiscus tea that was pretty great . i will definitely be returning . also , they have outdoor seating ( though it 's on the murray ave sidewalk and a little noisy ) and a clean bathroom .
0	i 've been visiting mind over batter on and off for a couple years now . i 've ordered two custom cakes and cupcakes for parties . neither time impressed me but the tempe location was convenient . i had n't been in recently but i was really craving the lemon raspberry cupcake and so i stopped in to the tempe location . it was awful ! two young gals were working and one was singing to the background music in the worst high pitched voice ! i had hoped she would stop once i got to the counter but no such luck . as she took my payment the singing continued ! i ordered one ( and thank goodness only one ) raspberry lemon cupcake . they changed it ! the frosting was definitely not the same . it tasted cheaper and not homemade ! frosting at albertons will continue to be my favorite . disappointing because i did really love that specific cupcake ! i will not recommend this bakery ever again !
0	was the only white person in there , stared at right away , whatever ! my money is jsut as good as the other peoples right ? ! food was meh . bread was stale and toasted . not a nice combo . meat wasnt well cut , or seasoned . the fresh flowers were a nice touch , but thats about it .
0	what happened to pei wei they used to bring the food to your table at the same time and this is the second time that the food trickles down . my partner is half way done and i 'm not served yet . their customer service is down big time : (
0	just because it does n't have meat , does n't mean it 's a `` veggie burger '' . lettuce ( and onion , upon request ) on a bun does n't make it a burger . it 's quite the sham . the fries and shakes may be good , but disappointing overall to anyone who cares about what they eat .
0	food was fresh and fast . dining area was dark and lifeless .
0	food was great , as usual , but management really needs to do something about the service . every time we come here for lunch we wait and wait and wait . there are usually only 1-2 servers downstairs and half the time they cant be found . its ridiculous . then , they leave tables full of the dishes from previous customers and take forever to get them cleared off . its actually quite disgusting . management : get a clue !
0	i 've had these cupcakes from three locations , including the huge cupcake bake-off competition . they 're always bland , a bit flavorless , and artificial-tasting . i do n't hate them , but the frosting is too thick and heavy and the cake is dense and blah . furthermore , they 're not always served fresh . the cupcakes they served at the cupcake bake-off were still partially frozen .
0	chance , the bartender , makes this airport bar feel like a bar in a busy city somewhere . she 's hard working , straight asks for id no matter what , cocktails have a good pour of alcohol . i 'd come here again .
0	i do n't think this place deserves four stars . my friend took us here for lunch and i thought the food was just average . the chicken panang curry was just ok , nothing special . the crab papaya salad was too salty . we asked the waiter for a whole catfish fried or bbq , i think he was n't listening because what we got were deep-fried cut up catfish filets . when we told him we wanted a whole catfish not filets , he said they only had filets . wth ? ? the only saving grace was the tom yum soup and combination fried rice . those very great .
0	was here visiting friends and stopped here for libations . tasty and strong margaritas . so strong that my friend could barely finish hers . it was cold and the heater was awesome . we had a fun time and the servers were very attentive . also , they had an inflatable snowman as a holiday decoration , and a drunk guy came up and punched it and then tried to get in the bar . he was summarily denied access . good call , bouncer , good call ...
0	burger was really big and good . wings were good but very small portion . beers are a bit pricey , but it was a good time
1	we rented from this company we had no problem at all . the did give us brand new car with 600 miles on it . check out was easy . the lady asked us about the insurance and the prepaid gas etc .. we declined and that was it . we booked through southwest web site great rate . nice car no problems .
0	as a vegetarian , jack in the box is n't exactly my first choice for fast food . that does n't stop my husband , however , from dragging me along whenever he gets a craving for jack in the box . this location is closest to home and is a quick and easy option for a late night snack or lazy breakfast . what i like about this jack in the box is that it 's clean and riff-raff is in general kept to a minimum . the employees are always polite and our orders are placed correctly . the drive-thru always seems to take forever though ... as for food , c'mon , it 's jack in the box !
0	just now getting to this review from this place i went to couple months back . note : not really big fan of fresh mex /tex mex cuisine to begin with . anyways the last time i ate at a chevys was years ago when i was in cali for happy hour . even then it reminded me of frozen mexi dinners . i ended up here because it was the only restaurant that was n't as busy unlike the mall food court which was full and so was other restaurant that was across this place . i was greeted & seated right away but it took about 10 minutes before a server showed up at my table to take my drink order . my drink from the bar showed up in no time , but not my waiter ... where the heck was she ? ? the place was not busy at all , especially the tables in her area ( there were 3 other tables ) i waited another fifteen minutes and was thinking of taking off and just paying for my drink when she showed up finally . well it took another 15 minutes from when she took my order till the food was dropped on my table ... literally . server mumbled the order plopped it on my table and dashed off pretty much . i took a double take on what was just served and im saying to myself , `` un effin believable , what 's that on my plate ? ? '' you know picture happy me took a pic and posted it on my other social media page and even my friends commented and had the same reaction as i did . the presentation was the worse ive ever seen , looked like a mish mash of .... food i guess , just thrown together at the last minute . to be fair , it was edible and the flavors of the sherry chipotle sauce complemented the shrimp tomatillo dish . well now i remember why i avoid chevys , the food is nothing to write home about and neither is the service apparently . thank goodness for my margarita , now that was good ! it saved that dinner experience . no wonder why my friends that go here have drinks first . you cant be sober eating the food here . i gave an additional star only because of the drink .
0	ok , let me tell you this : anybody who rated this place 5 stars could not have eaten at an authentic taqueria ... ever . because if they did , they would have easily ripped this place . i mean , c'mon , they throw some so-so carne or what they call carnitas into a tortilla , throw a pinch of cilantro & spoon a little guac and call that a taco ? the carne asada was salty and i 've made better carnitas in the oven . they did n't even use the `` real '' chico tortillas and they were single , not doubled up , like every other taqueria i 've ever been to in my whole life ! the salsa bar was ehhh ok ... i guess ... but i just could n't get over how half assed their tacos were . for a place that calls themselves a `` taco shop '' , i expected a helluvalot more . i guess it 's cool that they 're open 24 hrs , if you ca n't think of anywhere else to eat ... at least the coconut paleta was good ...
0	i visited the dowd ymca for the first time last night for a workout and a session in their steam room . normally i 'm a regular at the south charlotte y 's ( morrison , harris & siskey ) but since it 's a new year , i figured i 'd try my hand at visiting this y after work , since it 's only about 1.5 miles from my office . the reviews here helped to convince me to give it a try , so i figured i 'd write my own review as well to add to the information . i showed up around 4:45 and managed to find a spot . as soon as i walked through the turnstile i went to the guest relations desk and asked the woman behind the counter if she could direct me to the women 's locker rooms . she offered right there to give me a full tour , so i took her up on the offer . the facility is large , and as others have remarked , bustling . there were multiple basketball courts , two sets of lap lanes in the swimming pool ( one warm , one cold ) , and all the other features you 'd expect at a gym : spin room , tons of cardio machines just about everywhere you turned , machined weights and free weights . they had several stretch assisting machines and devices throughout the main gym area as well . the women 's locker room is indeed huge , and it 's overwhelming at first . lockers abound ( i think there are almost too many , there 's no way these fill up at 100 % ) . i only found two toilet stalls in the women 's locker room , but i 'm pretty sure i must have missed another set somewhere . one thing to note : you need a full-sized padlock for these lockers . i have used a small luggage style combo lock at the harris for a long time , but it does n't fit the lockers at the dowd . fortunately , they 'll let you borrow a keyed lock with a driver 's license . there are a limited number of machines ( perhaps a dozen or two , treadmills , ellipticals , stair steppers , recumbent bikes and rowing machines ) and free weights in the women 's locker room , and most of them were in use . i opted to climb onto one of the stair stepping machines for 20 minutes to start . after that i wandered the rest of the gym and hopped on a treadmill for a few more minutes . the stair stepper action ( it 's been awhile since i 've used a stair stepper ) caused my calf to tighten up uncomfortably , so i only spent another 20 minutes on the treadmill . it 's january and as you can imagine , the place is packed to the gills . i decided to ease off and hit the steam room , which let 's face it , is the real reason i go to the y ( well , this one and harris , at least ) . i just force myself to exercise before i get to the `` reward '' . and this is where the dowd y fell short for me . the steam room was the driest steam room i 've used , and the full , bright lighting made it less relaxing than the one at the harris . it 's not serene and quiet , people chat and talk loudly in this steam room . both the dowd & the harris y have spray bottles of eucalyptus from a `` club aroma '' spa supply place . the eucalyptus bottle at the harris y is occasionally running on empty , but when it 's filled it is good stuff . the `` eucalyptus '' at the dowd was non-existent . they 're cutting it so much with water ( i presume ) that it smells like nothing . the eucalyptus not only helps with opening nasal passages , it also makes the steam rooms smell nice , and this one - since there 's no real eucalyptus to spray - smelled decidedly not nice . finally , there 's something else others have touched on a bit : the rampant nudity in the locker rooms . here 's the thing - i 'm a bit of a prude about nakedness , being as i was raised in the south and taught the naked human form was an evil tool of the devil and all . but in a locker room , i realize that 's mostly my problem , and that the occasional flash of full frontal or a butt is the price you pay for dressing and undressing around other women . there 's a difference between flashes of nudity , and the women walking around the dowd y locker room for two hours , acting like they 're in a nudist colony . seriously , not a stitch on one particular older woman for two hours , as she stretched , dried her hair , lounged in chairs , and rubbed lotion on her face . i 'm real glad for her that she 's comfortable with the body she 's got , but * i 'm * not comfortable with it , and seeing her with her legs kicked up on the chair outside the steam room every time i entered it , just letting it all hang out , was disturbing . and it 's not just about looks , i do n't care how aesthetically pleasing your naked form might be , at least show a little courtesy and a slight amount of modesty . i did n't find the steam room or the locker room relaxing after my workout at all last night . i saw things no human should have to see , frankly . i appreciate it 's close to my office , but i 've heard childress-klein is too , and a little better about these sorts of things . i 'd recommend the dowd y , but only to people who really honestly do n't care about having strange women exhibitionists waving stuff around in their faces while in the locker room . as for me - i care - probably too much to return .
1	although there are few good middle eastern restaurants in phoenix and i have been trying since 2005 when visiting from california which i normally rate them 3-4.5 stars , until i tried this `` turkish kitchen '' which is hard to beat . let me start with the incredible bread came with `` acili ezme '' ( .. vibrantly red turkish chopped vegetable dip creased with rivulets of olive oil and jolted with hot pepper paste .. ) and lamb kabob was tender and delicious ... + tudi and other servers where checking every few mins , great service over all . do n't expect to be fancy , restaurant has casual sitting arrangements . but service , quality of food and taste compensate for everything else ... i would definitely try this place during future visit to phoenix .
0	not bad ! another vegas-style place that automatically brings straws with water and probably doles out styrofoam for leftovers , but decent food . there were 4 of us , and we were all happy . the service was good and attentive , and the food was decent for one of those diner spots . i had a hard time wrapping my brain around the portion sizes again . i ordered a veggie omelet that , in addition to being huge , came with a side of hash browns equally as huge . and an entire bagel ! it might have been offered as my toast option , but wow . a whole bagel ! i think i made it through about 60-65 % of what was in front of me and left overly stuffed . my partner had a breakfast burrito with a much more sane portion size and much easier to finish . it was super-tasty except for the too many jalapenos . he picked them off and was still suffering through the spice . so rec 'd only for those who love that kick .
1	honest employees did a great job.i was weary of going to an aamco . i have been to other aamcos and have had unbelievably bad experiences . yet , this aamco had a coupon on their website for a transmission fluid flush for $ 60 bucks , nearly half off ! the staff was very courteous and prompt . i called in the evening and they got me an appointment the next morning on a sat ! they were respectful , quick , and did n't feed me any bull about something wrong with my vehicle like every other shady mechanic in az . they did exactly what i paid aamco to do and they did it well . after the flush my transmission is running brand new and was an amazing deal to help further the lifetime of my transmission . these guys are honest and will make me a repeat customer for my future transmission needs ! thanks guys !
1	started off at the outdoor swapmeet and is now a nice little restaurant . good quality food and restaurant is in the same style as el gordo . good if you want to avoid the crowds that 's always at el gord
0	based on my many trips to frys electronics , i can tell you that finding help is nearly impossible ; nevermind that they have nearly 10 employees per customer . also , most everything i have purchsed from them is now broken . one in particular cost me over 1k and was dead in about 3 months - no refunds or exchanges , call the manufacturer ... unfortunately , i still go there because they are cheaper then best buy and have more things to choose from . great for window/idea shopping
1	huge servings , excellent friendly service , our waiter ben gave incredibly spot on recommendations , and is a major reason i will come back to buca !
0	i hate to say it but i 'm not very impressed with my two experiences here . both times i 've been here the staff had some issues going on . not very friendly or welcoming . at one point in my second visit , a man who looked like the boss broke something and looked pissed not only at himself but the employee that was next to him . both times i 've been here this place seemed kind of miserable . there 's no music playing as well which kind of adds to the coldness . i like my coffee shops warm and welcoming , with music and comfy chairs and even friendly staff . hopefully the days i went were unusually bad days for the staff here . the coffee was good but the cinnamon roll i got sucked . great idea , bad execution from what i 've seen .
0	decent facility . could be cleaner in the locker rooms . this location gets crowded , the neighborhood can get rough at night , but it 's the only one in the area . the facility is smaller than a lot of other 24 hour fitness locations , but they have one of the most efficient layouts i 've seen .
0	shopping for a child 's toy for my friend 's two year old brought me to toys r us . i ca n't say i would ever find myself in this store for anything aside from looking for a child 's birthday gift , and with good reason . the store is organized by genre of toy as well as age group , making it much easier for people like myself to get in and out in a tolerable amount of time . the selection seemed pretty good in just about every type of toy imaginable , except the particular toys i was looking for . go figure . i ended up walking out the door with a few items . they were n't cheap , but they were n't much more expensive than i found at other name brand stores , so i did n't feel too cheated .
1	we have been using horizon pet boarding & grooming for nearly three years and found them to be great ! lorraine , our groomer does a wonderful job . she is also very reasonably priced , as compared to nearby petsmart , or the posh pets in the area . those two were our previous dog groomers and we will never go back now that we have found horizon pet boarding & grooming and lorraine . yes she 's that good , and a hard working nice person to boot !
0	nice staff but that 's about all . would never stay here again
1	i usually just get take out from here , but we like the fact that they have vegetarian and seafood options .
1	the restaurant does n't look like much in it windowless basement . as usual the low brow asian restaurants in montreal seem to be squatting in a failed and former french bistro with some added asian art on the walls and a buddha statue with offerings of apples . the gracious and polite owners can barely articulate english and even french , their second language in viet nam , but then i often have difficulties of my own understanding coarse accents . but we can always end up understanding each other and getting the business done . i give them cash and in return i get awesome delicious food . i think this review might be unfair as i only order one thing off the menu . that is the ridiculously delicious banh mi sandwich . their banh mi deviates from the traditional bahn mi . but it does n't matter . usually banh mis are meat ( pork , chicken , sausage , whatever ) served with pickled carrots and daikon , cukes , cilantro , chili peppers , some kind of pat\u00e9 with mayo in a french baguette . this is a throwback to french colonial days . i always try to get mine mild , so out go the chilli sauce and or peppers . and i love that hoagie , with a passion . i tell everyone to try it . in fact i order them to get one of these brilliant sammies . however at caravelle they have a different take on it . they do n't have the tasty pat\u00e9 and the pickled veggies are replaced with a slaw of carrots and cabbage . normally the pickled daikon rocks my world . but here , the simpler banh mi is still one serious delicious treat , inexpensive and always fresh . even though i rapidly munch down the real foot long sub , i never feel bloated like one does eating a hefty sandwich , i feel rather refreshed . so i love it for both it amazing taste and the no-side effects . i dunno what it is about banh mis but i could easily eat them daily and never get bored and always find a new taste or texture to them . cheap quality eats with a coke for about 7 $ , now that 's a lunch i can live with considering the rest of the restaurants never let me go without taking at least 20 $ from my wallet . so anyone working near this spot , it is your duty to get this delicious banh mi sammy .
1	just ran across the reviews for this place the other day and went to check it out since it 's close to work . it does have almost everything food related from around the world . pretty amazing . produce and fish sections were minimal but clean and fresh looking . main attraction is all the packaged food sections . some prices were better than dinho or ranch99 . it might not satisfy everybody but sure makes it convenient to have so much in one store . i paid the 10 bucks and became a member .
0	6 months later cancel my membership already ! ! sent your terrible letter to cancel and you ignored it and now i 'm getting charged a $ 30 yearly renewal fee ? ! not worth the cheap prices , do n't do it !
0	very bad service . they do n't show up and are difficult to reach . do not risk using these for your pool !
0	i have been to this shop only twice . both times for a pedicure . my first experience was great ! the tech was pleasant and did a good job . when i made my second appointment i asked for the same tech . but when i arrived they said , `` we forgot to put it on her schedule . she 's busy . someone else will help you . '' although the second pedicure was `` okay '' , i did n't enjoy the experience as much . i will give them one more try ... if they mess up my next appointment i wo n't be back again .
0	cute place and i love the old fashioned malt shop ambience , but i will most likely not return . everytime we 've gone our orders are messed up in one way or another . i made the mistake this time of sitting at the counter in front of the food pick up window . they mixed our orders together so that neither of us got what we asked for . the cook had a question , but could n't get the waitresses attention so he cooked what he thought was written which was wrong . disappointed , but not a deal breaker . as i 'm eating i 'm watching the waitresses and hostess make toast . their long , nasty fingernails all over the toast , no gloves and one had a band-aid on the tip of one of her fingers . then the cook in the back comments `` these plates are filthy . '' the clincher , a black hair in my husband 's eggs . note to the staff : if you 're handling dirty plates and order slips please put some gloves on before you start handling people 's orders . i 'm so disgusted by this place . wait , one more thing ... one woman scratched her head and then proceded to butter toast . also , to the cooks in the back ... cover your long , nasty moustaches . enough said !
0	the worst buffet i been to in vegas . nuff said !
1	this place is hands down my favorite family restaurant ! the pork ossu buco is amazing , the meat falls off the bone . the buttermilk chicken is the perfect blend of sweet potatoes , gravy and chicken . not to mention they have a cool bar and a great patio . they have plenty of margaritas and mexican beers to choose from , my favorite is the `` margarita chingon '' made by kenny . nobody in the neighborhood can beat this place , nobody ! !
0	amc is alright but knew when rave left it would go downhill with prices , specials and appearances . it 's alright , nothing in comparison to rave though .
0	nice timeshare with all the amenities you would need for an extended stay . a good sized living area , dining area , kitchen , bedroom ( with walk in closet ! ) bath and washer/dryer . there is also a workout area , pool , barbecue area and free movie dvd rentals . i really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend this place for someone looking for peace and quiet . this is a bit away from the strip .. about a 15-20 min , depending on traffic . the free shuttle to the strip is great , however , can be a little inconvenient ( it only runs through a certain time each night ) . if you 're looking to party in las vegas , you probably want to book a location closer to the strip . if you 're looking for some time away to relax ( with side trips to the strip ) , this is the place for you .
1	good pastrami and patty melt . expensive , but big portions . definitely spiltable
1	by air or land when i arrive in beautiful las vegas the two first things that i do is get a drink , secondly call the monsoon group and more specificaly antonio espinoza ' s cell phone because in the 8 year of knowing him he has never steered us wrong . he goes the xtra mile to make sure your stay is one of the best ever . monsoon group has taken me to some of the hottest parties ! if anyone wants to see vegas how it should call antonio or the monsoon group
1	small restaurant that packs a tasty punch tonkatsu kiyoshi is a small-sized restaurant that offers tasty tonkatsu at a reasonable-ish price . the portion size is quite filling and food quality is superior . i was surprised at how homey i felt during my experience at tonkatsu kiyoshi -- both the ambiance and service played a role in that . pros : attention to detail to service , restaurant , dishes , presentation ; quality food ; great taste . cons : menu options ( maybe adding a chef special item would bring diversity to customers ) ; adding history to the brand ( how tonkatsu kiyoshi started ) would definetley benefit the already homey feel to the restaurant ; more engaging service . much potential for this restaurant . will definitely visit again for more curry . 4.5 out of 5 .
1	as with my other reviews , i 've dined at fnb a number of times before posting . i attended the winemaker dinner for canelo hills last night , and that was one great experience . these guys ( and girls , chef charleen and sous chef sasha ) have got a wonderful thing going . simple , well-executed menu of local/seasonal ingredients . i 'm addicted to their pasta offerings . addicted . i simply can not dine here without having the pasta dish ; fortunately i 'm a big eater and can manage that and starters and sides and an entree or two . sasha 's touch with the pastas is magical , and no matter what the pasta or ingredients , it will rock . jidori chicken is sublime , juicy inside and crispy skin outside . beautiful , savory lamb . ribeye with tapenade-like relish from charleen . a wine list of arizona wines , one of the ballsiest moves i 've ever seen . grilled asparagus with crispy beet chips ... now i make beet chips at home , they 're that addictive . my experiences at fnb have always included excellent service ... and very reasonable prices . my accomplice and i have at least four courses , wine , coffee and after-dinner drinks ; our check has never been over $ 160 . make reservations for the counter , and let the staff here wow you .
0	it 's cool
1	my husband and i was thinking the same thing everyone reads on here how can this sushi restaurant have 5 stars ? we were so curious , we needed to try it , we also thought its almost 7 pm and this is a 5 star restaurant then there is going to be a wait . we got there and parked and there was no line outside . i told my husband it must be closed . nope it was open- of course it would be its saturday ! there were a few tables opened and we got seated right away ! charles was our server ! he was great explaining the menu and making his recommendations . he was right , everything on the menu is good ! this is our new favorite place ! fish is fresh- its so fresh it just melts in your mouth ! you forget what fresh fish tastes like when you eat at ayce restaurants ! no more ayce for us ! salmon wasabi creme-hmm ! so good ! my favorite ! salmon is cut sashimi style , the roe gives it a salty taste , the creme gives a creamy taste ! i 'm addicted ! tadas- only $ 2 each ! we enjoyed the octopus , hamachi and tuna . all 3 were mixed with their sauce and placed on a wonton wrapper . good portion considering it was $ 2 each ! bone in short rib- if you are looking for a heavy dish then this was a good one to enjoy . the runner was right when she delivered the food as i was eating with my chopstick , do you need a fork and knife ? , i said hmm . then she said it falls right off when you eat it with your chopstick . she was right no knife needed . it was so soft ! the crispy onions made it more flavorful whole aji- like sashimi style raw fish ? this is a winner ! i do n't normally eat aji but i will here ! it was another one of my favorite ( surprisingly ) . i do n't even eat this at other sushi restaurants , but here , hmm , so good ! triple uni- it was a special on the board ! i do n't eat this but i will tell you what he said best uni ever ! be prepares there is no rice ! there is so much more we need to try ! we are so happy we found this place ! this is hands down one of the best on the southwest side ! we are definitely coming back ! thank you everyone for helping us find a good restaurant to celebrate my husbands birthday ! everyone 's review was spot on !
0	should n't be called a `` sushi '' bar ... maybe a bar with a view . bad service , no one even smiles ... beware that the hostess sends you to the bar to get a drink before they take you to the table or bar ... even if there are seats ... probably want you to buy a drink first . tuna is already cut when you sit down ... not the most fresh place to get fish . the sushi chefs ca n't be called sushi chefs ... they do n't know what japanese words mean . he did n't even know if they served hot tea ... no hot tea in a japanese restaurant ... yikes . rolls were boring and simple , and very expensive ... not worth it .
0	sorry guys , we are much bigger fans of the the hon machi on alma school . the service was horrible and the food was sub par .
0	blehhhh ... just a new place for the old folks from tom ryan 's to visit .... not a fan .
0	i wanted to love this place , but it was just ok in my opinion . the restaurant itself is pretty cool , lots of outside seating and room for kids to run around . the food , i felt was ok ... better than the majority of fast food places , but nothing over the top or begging me to come back tomorrow . two things that sort of bothered me , were the flies , ugh , everywhere , even inside , and - all of the drinks and condiments were located outside , which might not necessarily be a bad thing , was just weird to me . oh , and the ranch .. was ... weird , like runny ? and the taste was .. different . i 'll admit i am kind of a ranch snob , so it was n't horrible , just weird . i feel like if you 're gon na gloat about your fabulous onion rings , you should pair it with some decent ranch .
1	i went to sushi eye for lunch on a friday . the place was packed , the waitresses looked a little stressed and some of the clientele was a little crabby because they had to wait a little longer for their food . honestly , i 've waited longer at sushi restaurants for sushi that was n't worth it . i found the pieces at sushi eye to be pleasantly large , the rolls were delicious and well made and the service was very friendly . we tried the booty booty roll , the salmon skin roll and a few pieces of sake ( salmon ) and unagi . my only complaint was that we did n't have individual plates , so eating the end pieces of the booty booty roll was a little challenging because there was no way either one of us , even with mouths as large as we have , could fit the entire piece with the shrimp tails sticking out , in one shot ... so we ended up with a lot of rice in our soysauce dishes . but , it was a fun adventure anyway . oh , and the nigiri ... the pieces of salmon were twice as long as most other places . compared with the other sushi places i 've been to in az ( all two of them ) , the prices at sushi eye were the most reasonable . the regular rolls average around $ 6 or $ 7 while the special rolls ( like the booty booty ) average around $ 9 to $ 14 . the nigiri pieces were around $ 4 or $ 5 . one thing that did confuse me a little at first , and i 'm not trying to be picky here , i just want to help out people who have never been there before : the rolls are all listed in the front section of the menu while the pieces are listed in the back section , so you kind of have to look for them . this is important because somebody actually comes and takes your order rather than you filling out a slip of paper writing in how many of each item you want . if you go to their website , sushieye.com , you can see a full color menu there . it 's worth checking out before you go . oh , and they have a new location opening in chandler in november .
0	i do n't understand the appeal of this place . unless you have a seat at the bar or are lucky enough to be trapped there and can get the bartender 's attention , the service is abysmal at best , non-existant at worst . note to everyone - if you plan on having dinner , you will be there all night . cancel all other plans . if you 're lucky , you will get your dinner around last call . the one time i was actually served food at round corner , the food was pretty good .. it was also empty , so that is why i was able to actually order . so maybe the long wait is a bit of hyperbole , but we arrived at round corner around 7. we were seated quick enough , however the waiting game had just started . we were n't greeted by our waitress for about 10 minutes who said she would be right with us and disappeared for another 10. at least she returned with water for all . she took our drink order and left without our food order . this is when i realized we were in trouble . at 7:45 , she returned with our drinks and promptly walked away again . yes , if you 're doing the math , it took 25 minutes to get a round of 4 drinks . all beer . she returned around 8pm , by then we had been there an hour and we asked first for another round ( to get a head start on that ) and ordered our dinner . that was the last we saw of her . after another 15 minutes or so , my friend went to the bar to find the status of our missing waitress . our best guess was that she had been kidnapped and held for ransom unknown reason . my friend returned in just under 5 minutes with a new round for us and said that they were free due to the circumstances . by 8:45 we had finished all of our drinks and still had not even seen our waitress in the dining room . at 8:46 we left money on the table for the beer and a note that the money was for her ransom and left on our way to tamari never to return .
0	tries too hard to be `` sensual '' over compensates with boobs burlesque show style . the host was bad too .
0	they scratched my car . a big one and my bad that i did n't notice it while picking up the car . what more i have to say ?
0	it would had been nice if pick n pull left a message letting us no there no more pick n pull in az . n closes one to us is in fresono , ca .
0	been here many times but has always been disappointing . of late the quality is becoming worse . they are just well situated near intel , home of mini india
1	best steak i 've ever had ! the lighting was low but had a fun ambiance . the waitresses were good looking . i went with a friend on a monday night . ( 50 % off the menu ) i ordered the bone in rib eye ( 23 bucks with the half off ) and had it medium . it was cooked perfect with a nice crust on the outside . i also ordered the mac n cheese as a side and the potato trio . both were 6 bucks . incredible ! all the food was incredible and was served quickly without any problems . a little spendy without the 50 % but still well worth it .
1	town square really reminds me of home and i get that warm and fuzzy feeling every time i go there ( which is every weekend basically ) back is cali we have a mall in rancho that is called victoria gardens ... i was in love with that mall from the first moment i went there and my sweet little daughter and i would frequent it almost every weekend . town square might actually be a little nicer than vg ! ! it is now my go to location for sephora ( huge store there ) . my husband and i thought there was only one whole foods in vegas ( green valley by cheesecake factory ) but there is one at ts as well ! they have a nice justice there for the little girls ( very important to my 5 yr old ) express , h & m , old navy . the place is huge ... i still havent discovered all of the stores yet . i guess my favorite part of town square in the ambiance ... ( sounds stupid , i know ) but it is so important to me on how i feel when i enter a location ... i am always happy when i go there and always leave in a good mood . this is kind of funny .... last weekend i had just arrived at town square and my stomach started to kill me ... and i knew something bad was about to happen . i ran to the coffee bean and pushed everyone out of my way and made it to the restroom just in time . whew ... turns out i had the stomach flu really bad . the only thing i could think about was the fact that i would not be able to shop that day ... sadly i took my sick ass home ... but i came back the next day to finish shopping ! !
0	im pretty picky n i really like my nails , eric did a great job ! i got a full set w glitter tips and he did n't have to drill much . kinda pricey .. i would rate more but i dislike when the workers talk among themselves in a different language . however eric 's nails skills are wonderful . i also got a pedicure and it was less then 20 min long , so i felt a little rushed and the lady was n't very friendly or nice . but my toes look good , not sure if ill return or try a new place ..
1	i get down to visit southpark every now and then . i am thankful that today 's visit was a good experience . i was able to park in the garage to get out of the 100 degree heat and that made me very happy . the mall was brimming with customers but not overly crowded as it tends to get on some weekends . southpark is a great place to shop , when you have money , of course !
0	i was excited to try this mexican place in mint hill . i really wanted to love it because good go-to authentic mexican restaurants are becoming more and more difficult to find around here . everything was exactly what the 3 stars represent on yelp ... '' a-ok. '' nothing was amazing , nothing was puke-worthy . it was just ok. i am not desperate to return and no new cravings developed from my visit . i tried the shrimp fajitas and hubby ordered his usual beef tacos . my meal came with a salad before the entr\u00e9e and it was basically just chopped up iceburg lettuce . it was the oddest thing i have ever seen . i guess in theory it was a nice `` addition '' but they can keep their bag of lettuce ... seriously . the fajitas were okay . the black beans were dry and bland and i ordered a side of guacamole that tasted like water . it was gross . everything else was just ok , as mentioned . the salsa was okay , the service was decent and the food was basic/decent . if in the area , it is n't a bad option for a quick bite of mexican food .
0	the food is delicious but the service has never been good . one night , my date ( who is lactose intolerant ) asked for a salad sans cheese . the salad had to go back three times before they got it right . my pizza was cold before my date could even eat . another night i received a beer with a huge chunk of slushy ice in it . this was after clarifying our order twice , as the waiters do n't like to write things down . my verdict : if you want cpk , get takeout .
1	this place is awesome . having just moved from illinois it was nice to see some chicago influences . food is amazing and the owner is extremely friendly , almost like a spastic mother-like figure . awesome bbq and the pulled pork is on point !
0	not sure what the hubbub is about this place so took the fam to check it out .... ummm big mistake . chicken is way to greasy and really was n't that flavorful . give me popeyes or kfc or heck even bo ' , over it . sides were not to good either . if you must go for the experience of it , then shoot , go for it , but i doubt you 'll go back again .
1	andria cleaned our home this afternoon . she was super sweet and an amazing professional ! i just booked a recurring monthly service with her !
0	i read the reviews while waiting for the server to come and introduced himself to us . placed in the hard rock hotel & casino , this place mixes the traditional japanese seafood restaurant with some urban flair . this place was pretty darn expensive , but i guess when it comes to fine dining , anything goes . thankfully with my appetite , one entree was good enough with white rice . i had the sauteed eggplant , while my friends had other dishes with some sake on the side . had an asahi beer too . the ambiance was never quiet , but it fit the bill . the tab came out to over $ 100 , but i guess it works for them . the service was spot on , and the server automatically poured our beers without asking into a cup . thought that was pretty regal . other than that , i would n't say it sucked . but yet , it did n't give my seal of approval either . granted that it was expensive , i could 've used the money for other things , like gambling .
0	went last sunday for the brunch again . was all pretty good . not great , but good . do n't know if we 'll be back again , i guess i have a problem with paying $ 50 for brunch for two . it 's pretty pricey .
1	tasty , good value sandwich selection . great coffee . and i 've just this morning discovered they make a mean bacon roll too , and i 'm so fussy about bacon rolls i rarely buy them . very friendly staff .
0	do not come here if you are looking for a luxurious place to stay ! this is not the place for you if you wanted something luxurious . i got a room at the skyrise tower , the only word i can use to describe the room is it sucked ! first of all the hallway smelled like weed , the room smells bad , and it is dusty . this is first and last time , you 'll see me there .
1	+ awesome service + delicious steak + thin crispy shoe string fries + super fluffy cinnamon sugar donuts + heirloom tomato salad with basil - yum + border crosser ( shot of tequila + beer ) came here with friends in hopes of delicious delicious meat . they change their menus so what we were hoping to get was no longer on the menu , sigh . however , the manager came buy and said if we ever call in a day before hand they 'll be sure to make it for us - score . our group ended up ordering various steaks topped with eggs and frites , and i ordered the lobster pasta . everything was delicious and freshly made . but my favorite was the donuts , seriously something about that light and fluffy dough coated in cinnamon sugar . plus it comes with 3 dipping sauces ( chocolate , caramel , berry compote ) omg . if you go save room for dessert !
1	not sure if it is because it is located within walking distance of where i live , the fact that its on the water , the free wifi , the delish coffee or the off-the hook ambiance , but this place has my heart ! ! the place is located on lakeside street which the area appears to be residential then there is this area of retail right in the middle . super cool . coffee in a mug- $ 2.23 this is all i had on this visit but , will be back for the scones . there is an area set up with a couch , coffee table and book shelf where you can look directly out the window which overlooks monona bay.there are several tables out back on the deck and some tables outside in the front that face the street . every other friday there is acoustic guitar and the bar serves wine and beer . i have yet to get down here and check it out . the coffee house is also open wed-sun ( look up hours on website ) evenings serving wine and beer . summer blush is only $ 4 a glass ! ! whoaaaa ! ! ! if you are taking a walk or bike ride around monona bay , this place is right on your way . stop and take a break ! !
1	best dining experience in most recent memory ! this place has it all ! the decor , the great drinks , creative and delicious food , and location ! a perfect place for a special occasion or just a treat with that special someone ! attention to every detail has been thought of in this place ! the specialized drink menu for instance has drinks named after giana 's grandfather who was movie producer dino de laurentis . all the drinks have names of some of the movies he produced . to start , they bring a lovely bread assortment with dipping sauces , do n't miss the rosemary roll ! the cheese dishes are various sizes and assortments , depending on the size of your table . the only thing i will warn you of is that they tell you the portions are n't large enough to share , but they are !
1	le vieux velo seriously nailed every expectation i had . on both occasions i had gone , it was a busy sunday brunch hour , and of course a little bit of a wait was to be expected . however , that never lasted more than 20-30 minutes . to make that wait pleasant , they send you to cafe odessa just next door , where you can order a coffee or tea and keep warm until someone from le vieux velo comes to get you when your table is ready . it 's a pretty genius idea actually , and the collaboration between the two establishments most definitely assists in each of their sales . once you 're in and seated , you 'll notice it 's a little bit cramped up , but they make due with what they have . the menu is fairly simple to make your way through . as soon as i saw their eggs benedict , it was a no brainer that that 's what i was going to order . i stand by the notion that if i can make something equally as good at home , i wo n't order it at a restaurant . so i 'll always go for what i 'm incapable of making myself ! the b.a.b . had my name all over it , i already knew this before i even got in . it was mind blowingly phenomenal and tasteful . until today , i 'm still raving about it , and i will definitely be back for more .
1	who would have thought eating without utensils could be so enjoyable ? the first time i ate here , i had no idea what to expect . my only other experience with ethiopian food was n't favorable , but i 'm always willing to give food another chance . and i 'm glad i did ! ethiopian famous restaurant is an experience of its own . tucked away in the back room of an african grocery store , it 's unpretentious and very basic by all appearances . the food , however , stands out . i prefer the meat dishes over the vegetarian options , but that 's not to suggest the latter is n't flavorful and fulfilling . i just really like meat . everyone i 've taken here is initially skeptical -- will they serve me dirty water and boiled rice ? ; am i going to get shot in that neighborhood ? but upon eating here , they have all agreed that ethiopian famous is truly a remarkable restaurant .
0	it was my first time in las vegas , so i wanted to visit every casino i could . this was by far the worst for customer service . i sat down at a slot machine , only to have a grumpy security guard come over and complain about his job to me . i asked if there would be a cocktail waitress , the security guard told me that they released most of the staff and there is only one cocktail waitrees on duty at all times now ( which by the way she only works in or close to the high rollers room ) . never did get asked about drink and after listening to `` oscar the grouch '' for 45 mins while playing a slot maching , i left . he did not even offer to find the waitress when i asked .. all he told me was go look for her . i will never go back in that casino again .
0	i had breakfast here with bf & my niece . the server seemed kind of spacey and weird . the menu had many , many items on it , so it took us awhile to decide . finally ordered - eggs benedict florentine for me , pancakes & sausage for my niece , and a bagel with salmon for the bf . food came out and it looked great . then we ate it . bf did like his bagel & salmon , but come on , how can you eff that up ? niece 's pancakes were dry . she said not even syrup could save them . bf tried her cakes and agreed that they were the driest he had ever had . she also said her sausage was bland . my eggs benedict florentine was not good . first off , they put swiss cheese on them . cheese ? hm . one of my eggs was totally undercooked and beyond runny , the other was totally overcooked and the yolk was all dried out . one of my english muffins was stale and i could n't even cut through it . the spinach was good , but that was about it . oh yeah , the total for this crappy breakfast ? $ 67 ! ! !
1	grimaldi 's opened in summerlin recently and am i happy . one of the best pizzas in las vegas . they spread the cheese different than other pizza places in that it 's put on in drops , so there 's drops of cheese and drops of sauce . it 's no wonder they have 13 locations in vegas , arizona and texas . they do pizza right . the sauce is delicious . real pizza sauce , not spicy and no tomato chunks . they have an outside eating area that 's very comfortable , but the pizza gets cold out there . stay away from the high priced drinks and a large pizza with drink will be under $ 20 , not counting tip .
1	ghost bar is the shizzle ! beautiful bar on the 50 somethin floor of the palms resort boasts beautiful views of the city , great music and good drinks . i think this is a must go bar if you are at the palms . even though , its not as crowded as moons and rain , the bar 's large sky dec with bar on either side outside feels uber cool . make sure you look down the glass floor of the deck . mind bogling ! ( do n't do it if u afraid of heights though ! ) this place did n't have a lotta danceing going on like moon or rain , but it definitely is a nice place to chill , enjoy the view , the music and the drinks !
0	make sure that they are open first ! stopped by the day before thanksgiving , the day after , and the day after that . had to buy the chicken parm sandwich as my third choice , since my first two options they were out of ! not sure how long in this world this place will be here , i wish them the best
1	this place is amazing ! i took in a pair of pants with a nail polish stain on them . i thought the pants were ruined forever ! but del rey took care of the stain , it was ready the next day , and it only cost $ 2.41 . my jeans are saved ! i had a very great experience with this company and will definitely be going back in the future .
0	i went to old navy with the kids to buy some stuff . they did n't find much stuff . but the people that work there are really nice and make sure that you get the sale price when there 's a sale on the item . it looks like my kids have kind of graduated from old navy so i do n't see too many return trips in the future . that manikin entourage as you walk into the store was a little freaky in my opinion . what do you think ? check out the photo .
0	definitely competitively priced . communication is not their strong point . i scheduled a move and called back a bunch of times , leaving unreturned messages to ensure it was scheduled and that they had received my signed contract . they were about 1.5hr late for the move ( `` staffing issues '' ) and i was somewhat turned off by the comment `` you do n't have to tip us but if you do make sure you give it to us each , i do n't trust __ [ another of the movers ] __ . '' mind you that person had clipped $ 10 bills to his shirt to show that he accepted gratuity that being said , the move was very quick and relatively painless once they got to work . one of the movers , rodney , definitely knew what he was doing and instructed the others on how to carry items properly . luckily , he did the packing of the breakable items as well and was very careful to wrap items numerous times . they bring their own moving blankets and i appreciated how they wrapped the couches and mattresses with saran wrap to prevent damage , it seemed to help . so , other than the sketchiness as above , the move ended up going fine with minimal damage to the walls and items ( definitely a plus ) . would i go with them again ? yes , if i could ensure that they had a crew with at least a few people who had moved before
1	one more thing ... crafts ! ! ! i would have to say that my love for food is matched by my love for crafts . here in the islands , we only have a handful of full fledged craft supply stores . michaels is like an amplified version of it all . tip : buy a little , get a coupon , buy more with the coupon , get another . sign up for emails online , get another . i love to find findings here and wished that we had one in hawaii .
1	we called focus plumbing , a company we had done business with in the past , three times , and since they never returned our call , we called precision . a real person answered the phone and sent a technician the same day . paul messingschlager arrived on time , unclogged our drain using a vacuuming machine , ( and showed me how to do it myself if it ever happened again ) . he actually left our kitchen cleaner than when he started , carefully mopping the floor where some water had leaked during the process . he looked at our water softener , giving expert diagnosis and advising we contact the retailer who sold it to us . the plumber who previously looked at our water softener told us it was just fine ... paul took it apart and showed me where and why it was malfunctioning . it took more effort to do so , but it confirmed the fact that precision plumbing trains its technicians to do a thorough job . paul was very professional , competent and has earned not only any future business when we are in need of a plumber , but also our confidence in recommending them to our friends and family . so the moral to this story is that it pays to answer the phone , if you run a business . by not doing so , focus lost us to a company that communicates exceptionally well with its customers , trains its technicians to be competent professionals , and values its customers . we will be loyal customers of precision plumbing in the future .
0	this review is of their ri ra sandwhich shop around the corner since there is no separate listing for this shop . stopped here because i 've never been before , so i ordered the old faithful reuben . pretty hard to screw up , right ? well they managed to serve me a sandwhich that was barely eatable as the corned beef in it was like leather .... very hard and chewy . the sandwhich was small . for $ 9 i 'd expect a lot more . the rose sauce was n't as flavorful as i would expect . not a very good sandwhich . service was iffy at best . the young lady behind the counter was very nice and personable , but the other two seemed like they did n't want to be there ... aloof is the appropriate term . the only saving grace were the keogh 's dubliner irish cheese and onion potato crisps imported from ireland . if this place is going to rely on packaged potato chips to save them they wo n't be in business long . so a small sandwhich , chips and a 20oz bottle of diet coke set me back $ 14 with tip . that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich . i will not be coming back . not recommended !
0	this place is pretty cool , obviously come at night so you can see the rest of vegas with its lights on , otherwise i do n't think it would be interesting at all . the tour is quick and not all that much to do . i would say you can look at all of this in 20 minutes or less . there is a bungee jump thing you can do here but nobody from our group wanted to do it .
0	it 's not as run down as most of the cec 's i 've been to before and there 's a lot of parking even a creepy back alley of parking spaces ( do n't park there ! ) . with that being said i just ca n't stand this place . it 's loud , the food is terrible ( unless you get the salad bar ) , most of the games are out of order and does anyone watch their kids ? ? i see the allure to have birthday parties here , it 's a one stop shop . you show up and they do everything for you . i mean what party is n't complete without a dancing rat and obnoxious party host ? kinda generic if you ask me . you 'll be better off going to the mini grand prix , pump it up , bounce u , or the discovery museum for a far better experience . but much to my chagrin , i ca n't deny my kids love it here so i get suckered into taking them . i hope they 'll change their mind about this place soon but until then i guess i 'll have to suck it up . sensory overload ugh ! ! : /
1	this is a very evil place because i end up spending money here when i should n't . there are lots of shops to keep you entertained for hours . if you 're not a big gambler , then this is a great spot to kill time . if you forget makeup , there 's a mac store for you . if you need extra outfits or shoes , then you can find it all here . i ended up buying myself a little treat tiffany 's on my last visit . you can even get yourself a margarita at fat tuesday 's to make your shopping trip more fun !
0	admittedly , i 'm a steak snob so when i go and plunk down a couple of hundred bucks plus for a dinner we expect it to be something special . however this is n't about the price , it 's about a place that boasts `` the best italian on the strip '' and is supposed to be about the meat and wine . i 've eaten steak at a few places including craftsteak , delmonico , del frisco 's , the homestead , as well as the chains like flemming 's , morton 's , and ruth 's chris ... so yes , i 'm a steak guy . now i know any steakhouse can have an off moment , i 've sent steaks back probably at one time or another at every place except craftsteak where i ate two iowa corn fed bone in strip steaks , but i 've only eaten there once . okay , you get the picture . so carnevino : let me first say that the staff was excellent , the hostesses were genial and professional , our waiter brayden was extremely nice and professional as well , and the rest of the dining room staff was attentive without being overbearing . the decor was very warm and inviting , and did have an up-scale steak house feel . the somewhat blaring 80s music was a little the food was a disappointment . at this level of dining i expect excellence . i first ordered a bone in ribeye for one . the menu listed it as a bone in ribeye for two and charged $ 70 per person as a single entree it was $ 95 , i ordered it medium rare with italian broccoli as a side . when the steak came i noticed that although as big as the plate , the steak was pretty thin . it reminded me of a breakfast steak one might expect at a diner . i cut into it and of course it was medium well . i changed my order and decided to go with the bone in strip steak which was on the menu as a regular single serving item and grazed on the very tough , but tasty italian broccoli . when the steak arrived , it was lightly seared , probably in a pan , but the temperature was right when i cut into it . the meat was a little on the tough side and was definitely under seasoned . the wife went with pesto gnocchi , which was fine , but nothing spectacular . the wine we wanted was unavailable and the sommelier recommended a suitable substitute . overall , it was an average experience , and not up to par with even commercial establishments like flemming 's or ruth 's chris . mario has some work to do in order to make carnevino the steak destination it should be .
0	not bad at all , but the omelets and pancakes are better at crackers .
1	after surveying the family , we all agreed on 4 stars . the three of us ordered combo plates . chimi , steak picado , and green chile burrito . the entrees were about the right size . they skimped on the rice and beans , though . probably half the size they should have been . but the flavors were very nice . simple , but good . the beans tasted `` fresh '' compared to the glop you get at most mexican restaurants . i would still have preferred to substitute them . menu says `` no substitutions '' , but maybe that does n't apply to the rice and beans ( i like double-rice ) . no chips and salsa , but that 's ok. and the price is definitely right . probably 30 % less than most other places serving similar food . and many of them are n't as good ! oh ... and the lemonade is fresh . not that minute maid swill . i thought it was very good . seating is very limited . if more than a dozen people show up there will be no place to sit . we were lucky that they were n't busy when we arrived . it 's a bit far from my usual stomping grounds , but when i 'm in the area this will be my choice for mexican food .
1	thanksgiving eve i enjoy creating fresh floral arrangements for my home ! as the produce is always so fresh i did n't hesitate selecting two bunches of premium mixed flowers . what appeared to be lovely fresh materials to create with ended up being about half garbage ! black wilted leaves droopy heads , broken stems ! an attempt to make it right by replacing not and an offer to also reimburse only one but two bouquets as well as the cost of one was offered by the manager on duty . the two replacements were fine . but when hubby arrived no refund was granted . i really did n't mind as i managed to create lovely arrangements . what i did mind was how quickly the flowers faded ! i 've had clearance bouquets at next to nothing from smiths last longer . i realize this is a first year for this sprouts to be in business , i 'm hoping that ones word is good as gold and that freshness becomes a priority for flowers too ! ! ! yes i was generous with 4 stars as the over all rating for my two shopping experiences warrants it overall !
0	came to victory 's cafe on a whim since it was late and a lot of other places were closed for dining . 24 cafe baby ! not bad when you are super hungry and have not-so-super amounts of money in your pocket ( damn you ... slots ) . of course , this being a 24 hour joint , late at night you do attract some interesting people . this night , i swear half the patrons eating were buzzed , drunk , super drunk , or well on their way on getting super duper drunk . it was a bit loud and the air reeked of stale heine ( ken ) ! interesting , but not typically my type of crowd . luckily no belligerent drunks were trying to bully me , so i kept my left & right guns in their holsters . no gun show tonight ! p90x you have become the bane of my existence . victory cafe does have some late night specials as well as serving breakfast all day , which appealed to me . omelettes , skillets , pancakes , waffles , french toast , could all be had . because sometimes ... you just want breakfast for dinner darnit ! the wifey thinks breakfast for dinner is illegal , so i constantly ask for portuguese sausage , spam , eggs & rice for our evening meal . yeah , i 'm like that . the $ 9.99 prime rib special looked like a decent cut , but i was n't feeling it that night . so we just ordered off the regular menu . i got a build your own burger , which i kept pretty basic with just cheddar cheese , lettuce , tomato , pickle , and onion with a side of fresh potato chips . the lady got a philly cheese steak that had sliced beef with onions , peppers , and mushrooms topped with swiss cheese with a side of potato salad . sounds like late night eats to me ! overall the food was n't bad . nothing great , but it 's hard to mess up a burger and a sandwich . it 's akin to what you would find in most late night eateries in just about any casino cafe here in las vegas . food for those that need to sober up so they can take their losing @ $ $ es home . yes folks , majority of us gamblers here are losers . make no mistake , that 99.7 % payback on video poker and slots eventually lands you to zero ! my burger was cooked right , medium with a bit of pink , and the bun was thankfully toasted on the grill . cheese was nice and sharp , and the produce in my burger was fresh . the big surprise was the fresh made potato chips ! they were great ! nice , hot , and super crisp . i ate these up with a side of ranch dressing . but they were just as good with a splash of hot sauce on top . a welcome substitute for fries . the wifey 's philly cheese steak was ok. nothing notable to write about , it just was n't the best she 's had . her potato salad was good , but for some reason it tastes very similar to the kind you can find in bulk at your local costco or sam 's club . which is n't all that bad , but something more home made would have been nice . i will gladly go back to the victory cafe again if i 'm on that side of town and want a quick and cheap bite to eat . and possibly if i 'm as drunk as a skunk . there 's a lot of heft in their menu and other things i would definitely give a try . i love a good denver omelette or a club sandwich . but i will definitely go back for some of those fresh made potato chips ! victory is mine !
0	scale of 1-10 ( multiple visits ) : 6 food 5 * drinks * 7 service 7 atmosphere 7 value i do n't dig this place , i do n't hate this place . it 's alright , but not special . the menu seems challenging to maneuver for some reason , and the drinks are lackluster . but there is creativity here and i appreciate that and can enjoy exploring and experiencing it after i 've gotten past the first obstacles i mentioned . it 's location is also a bit off the light rail and on an uber ped-unfriendly road ( 7th st ) , so it 's not somewhere i make it to very often . btw : the happy hours here are pretty good .
0	yuck ! i 've been to tasti d-lite several times and have always found it to be below average . the taste and quality of the yogurt is poor and they charge a premium price for a very mediocre product . there are so many better choices in the area ! ! !
0	this is a small local place has seating for about 38. they have a great selection of beer . they also have two smaller tvs ( 32 '' ) and one larger tv ( 50 '' ) . i will reiterate that the beer selection is more than reasonable , but that 's the only positive i can think of . my wife ordered a mixed drink with a wedge of lime . the lime was brown and smelled horrible . the cheese curds were not bad , but they were n't memorable at all . the are lightly battered and served hot with a side of ranch . they are a bit greasy , but again not bad just not good either . they left me saying , `` meh '' . i ordered a chicken sandwich with fries . the chicken appeared to be precooked and frozen and was simply warmed back up . it was served on a kaiser bun , which did have nice flavor . the wilted lettuce took away from it completely though . the plain mayonnaise was needed but it 's complete lack of flavor just took away from this already below average sandwich . the french fries were definitely frozen and then deep fried . another instance of they were n't bad but they were n't good . i do n't like giving out poor reviews , but i think people also need to know what to expect . come here if you want to get a beer and well that 's about it .
0	let me first say that my massage therapist , andrew , was amazing . he worked out every knot and kink in my back . kudos . excellent massage . the rest of the experience was just okay . the staff was n't extra nice or helpful . there was only one attendant for the entire women 's side . there was a shortage of towels . things i like at a spa : hairspray , deoderant , bags for my wet swimsuit , moisturizer , face wash ... alas , none of that was available . i had to ask for things and felt bad , since the attendant was all alone and busy ... so i asked for a bag for my wet swimsuit and called it a day . check out took a long time . the slippers are stretched out and not comfortable . anyway ... andrew gives an excellent massage and is worth the visit .
1	came here with my wife for a getaway from la . food 5/5 ambiance 5/5 service 5/5 my friends and family thought its weird that i like this particular restaurant so much , but i really do ! there is nothing like overlooking the fountains of bellagio and having a romantic meal with the woman i love . made me feel like a millionaire ( although i 'm not ... yet ) . will definitely be back !
1	visited on a friday night , dec 26 , 2014. this is an upscale spot , with a live jazz band that was n't so loud you could n't hold a conversation ( we were seated at the bar ) . the bartender was friendly , and made my buddy one happy camper with the suggestion of visiting top shelf to purchase the rum he was looking for . this is a spot to take a date for an intimate conversation , where the drinks are priced to keep the riff-raff out . i 've actually been here for high tea too , which was enjoyable . my biggest complaint is that they are going for a tranquil atmosphere , but what barely constitutes a wall-divider separates the lounge from the front desk ... so a lot of foot traffic is a bit distracting . good for a place to see and be seen , but not ideal for tea .
0	i came here to get some work done on the laptop and since they list their hours as open until 11:00pm i figured i could get more done than by going to lux who close at 10:00pm . i was not a happy camper when , at 10:22pm , i was informed that `` the lobby is closing in 10 minutes '' they need to change their posted hours because i would not have come here if i knew i was going to have grab my coffee , pack up and leave . i prefer to patronize local coffee establishments anyway , so i should have stuck to my guns .
1	amazing service , they really must have a seperate washing machine for the main plates they use- cleared like 4 from me alone . i 'm sure that everyone comments on the sea bass , and so i 'll add my two cents- phenomenal . fresh sea bass is tough to find and they prepared it the best way possible ( imho ) , skewered with a miso glaze . we depended on our sharp , confident waitress to guide us through the menu and she did wonders . along with the sea bass , our rolls were expectantly first class as was the fresh tuna seviche with almonds and jalapenos rich with flavor . aside from the crazy movie looping on the wall in the background wandering aimlessly from a south china fishing village to a hot brazilian beach ; the atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable also- a bit trendy , but what did you expect ?
0	overall the food was pretty good ! be sure to ask for salsa and guac in the burrito , unlike chipotle they dont put inside . the horchata is great !
1	i had a wonderful huevos rancheros and a delish red velvet cupcake . i saw it when i walked in last week and decided to try it yesterday . it was everything i dreamed it would be . the waitress was also very friendly and fast .
1	food truck fav right here ! i 've been wanting to try pizza people 's pizza for a while now . i found out they were setting up at 180 degree 's automotive and i figured if bogi was hosting them then i needed to check them out ! i finally caught up with them at local fest . bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $ 8 but she assured me it was yummy ! first of all $ 8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal ! secondly , bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world ... and i trust her implicitly .... so i ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes . i ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato . i took it back to my table to share with my mama ( who is also gluten free ) and we both said at about the same time : `` oh , my gosh this is really good ! '' something i 've only said about twice since eating gf pizza ! the sauce is fresh , the dough was the best gf dough i 've had to date and the toppings were just divine . i need to put a gps tracking unit on this truck so i can track it daily ! ( oh , wait ......... i can just check their facebook page ! ) yeah , i 'd eat it daily ! it 's that good !
1	so i was on the first train , at 10 am on saturday , dec. 27th . i have ridden the train every day since , mostly to tempe and back , but a couple times westbound . i 've ridden it to do grocery shopping , go to dinner , go drinking , celebrate my birthday , hell just about everything . my truck has been driven once since the first day of service , and i 've ridden my motorcycle maybe 4 times .... its been 9 days folks . this thing changed my daily routine for the better . i understand i could have done the same thing with a bus , but the bus only ran every 30 minutes and took forever and was uncomfortable and was so small if there was a smelly bum you could n't get away from him . the train has changed it all for me . what 's keeping it from 5 stars ? the same thing that everyone else is complaining about , the running hours . i 'd love to not have to leave the bars at 10:40 to get a ride home . it 's also very inefficient running through the city . i can get from the 12th street station to mill avenue in 16 minutes which is about 11 miles . in the meantime , it takes about 23 minutes to get to camelback , which is half the distance . also , i do feel very insecure at the eastlake platforms at night time . i wish they could do something to at least give you the illusion that you are safe .
1	absolutely one of our favorite spots .
0	thank you very much for tearing up my luggage and then claiming it is not within the policy of your company to replace . i totally understand that wear and tear happens ... in fact , i expect it . however , it appears as though a united employee had a very bad day and took it out on my luggage . the united representative at las was professional and courteous , but obviously could not do anything about it and was quick to rehearse a canned speech that i no doubt believe he has had to use many times . i at least appreciate that he treated me w/ respect . what 's going on united ? ? ? ? it obviously appears you are more focused on profits and not customer service . time to change airlines ? ? ?
1	damn this place is cool . it 's emo , retro , funky , angst-like , but down to earth . i think you can walk in here , and fit in pretty easy if this is what you like and is your `` thang '' . it 's not for the average scottsdalian , but is a great place for music , drinks , and conversations in close quarters . it 's quaint and reminded me of many pubs and bars in boston . any place that has tiny bathrooms reminds of boston lol ! it even has a nice gas burning fire place which with the winter cold , gives it a nice warm touch . add to this the x-mas lights they had up , and the decor , this place is a 5 star haven of cool . i can see myself going here again and again , and since i live close , a cab ride is the way to go , to avoid the smokies . i recommend this place , and if you feel you need to move around , they have darts and a pool table . it is small so check your attitude at the door , or just leave it home in the closet next to your beer muscles . i even saw a guy here that fixed my bike from rage cycles , ( see my review on rage ) now i really dig that place !
0	great place for late night drinking . happened to be in the parking lot of the hotel i was confined to for 3 weeks . huge shots of blackhaus , 3 pool tables , and friendly enough staff . ca n't think of a better place to throw back beers @ 4am while playing porno picture hunt . did i mention huge shots of blackhaus ? food is not bad either .
0	the food is bland and service is suspect ( slow ) ... clientele is senior citizens which i personally do n't mind ... food is a little expensive given the mediocrity of taste . i have been there twice now , and was underwhelmed both times . probably wont go back , but if your 55+ you should check it out as you might see some of your buddies ....
0	barely good enough for the money you will spend . the wine list is overwhelming and the menu is full of pretentious dishes that fall short of expectations . the food here is definitely good , but you can get a comparable or better meal at a place like tender or brand . their dessert menu is probably the best thing they got going .
0	servers were clueless ! no menu knowledge . terrible service ! disgusting food . soggy fries . expensive for quality . will never go again .
0	i was there for a business convention . i was presenting the next day . people partying in the hall at 4a.m . multiple calls to the front desk with no success . had to go to the front desk several times between 4-5am to change rooms to a quiet floor . exhausted the next day during presentation . front desk was unresponsive , unprofessional , and incompetent .
0	i had been here on one previous occasion . as much as like spending my time with the geriatrics of sun city , i 've found i need to venture further outside of surprise to find the x/y generation . so , i did . for happy hour . after spending time with with good peeps , 4 street tacos , and two exes ( the beer , silly . two exes at the same time ? not me . ) i had claimed salty seniorita safe , and acceptable . naomi , our server , was great , too . stop the show . i had a lapse in judgement . i 'm sorry . i went back with my gf on st. patty 's day . well , night actually . it was windy , and stormy . cool change of weather . our server was attentive and nice . can you tell i 'm holding out ? i 'm refraining from going on about how bad the food was . but i can not help it now . the chips and salsa are so bland and plain . the salsa is like hot watery cilantro puree . flat , bland , and uninspiring . and ... they charge you $ 2 for the pleasure . are you kidding me ? my gf ordered the taco salad with blackened mahi . the fish came out under cooked and mushy . not even an attempt at the blackened part of the equation . the salad was a heap of shit . just a pile of stuff thrown haphazardly into a shell , that was food colored green . maybe it was a spinach taco shell , but it looked like a food colored taco shell . i ordered the fajitas . i pulled several large chunks of gristly meat out of the plate . the shrimp was poorly packaged , over frozen , overcooked , and tasted flat and bland . that was after i had picked through the onions . also , someone may want to put an apb out on the bell pepper . large , green , red , or orange type pepper found in fajitas and other dishes . mine had escaped . yes . really . no bell peppers in my fajitas . the beans were canned rosarita beans . same bland garbage that can be bought in a store . black beans , canned as well . so why the 2 stars ? the drinks were good . they have a margarita that is fresh squeezed and made from scratch that is awesome . the mango marg is great , my gf liked the prickly pear marg , and the house marg is not bad . service was good too . if they got the food on par with the service and the drinks , this would be the place to go in the west valley .
0	i went in there today for a money order . tell me why the clerk told me there 's a $ 5 charge for the freaking money order ? ! five dollars ? ! whet ? like who does that ! ? especially when other places such as supermarkets or even the post office charge under a dollar ! i had even checked the website before hand just to see how much the charge was for a money order and the site did n't give one . that 's probably because they know $ 5 is too dang high ! unfortunately , i was in a rush so i had to pay the 5 bucks but dang . lesson learned . do you know what i could 've done w/ $ 5 ? well let me tell you : costco 's gas is currently $ 2.50/gallon . i could 've gotten two more gallons of gas . a $ 5 foot long from subway before the tax . an old navy t-shirt for the low . a pack of hamburger meat . underwear , b/c you ca n't have enough underwear . basically you can buy a lot of things w/ $ 5 instead of spending it on a dang money order . i have a checking and savings account there but charging that hot mess price smh . also had to wait a good 5-7 minutes inside before getting help .
0	we decided to branch out for lunch and try something new . caribbean food was at the top of the list and i liked the look of the caribbean hut , so we decided to give them a chance . we walked in and stepped up to the counter where it says `` order here . '' we were told that we could sit anywhere and we 'd be helped . i was n't expecting a full-service restaurant , but okay . we each started with jamaican sodas -- a ginger beer and a cream . the cream was good ; it was sweet . and i loved my ginger beer . it was n't like ginger ale ; it was more like sweetened carbonated water with a lot of ginger spice , giving it a small kick ! for entrees , they offer small and large versions . the small was plenty of food . thankfully , that 's what we ordered . we both tried the jerk chicken entree . it came with either yellow or white rice or rice and beans , as well as a veggie . i assumed the yellow was the traditional caribbean rice , so that 's what we went with . the rice was excellent ; it was full of flavor . the collard greens were pretty tasty , too . a jerk marinade covered the chunks of chicken , and had a kick to it as well . the only downside with the meal was that the chicken was still on the bone with fat and skin . i 'm not really a bone , fat , and skin kind of guy . i like the meat . just meat . otherwise , it becomes work and i 'm biting into things that i 'm not supposed to be biting into . it makes the meal less enjoyable . we did n't feel like we got our money 's worth meat-wise . loved the rice and veggie , but it would have been much , much better to have boneless chicken breast cut up and marinated in the jerk seasonings . the restaurant itself did n't have a lot of atmosphere , but it did have a lot of windows , which made it nice during the daytime to catch the sunlight . jamaican/caribbean music played on the speakers and our server was very sweet and friendly . then there 's the pricing . $ 8- $ 10 an entree for dinner is great . for a quick lunch , not so much so . our lunch for two with tax and tip came to $ 26 . that 's a little excessive for a strip mall restaurant during a work lunch break .
0	came in for dessert after having dinner at central , since they did n't have a very appealing dessert menu . shared a strawberry sundae with my bf b/c i know how big the portions are and i think the server was annoyed that we were sitting in his section and only ordering one item , which i get , but we were still going to tip him well . but even so he should not be rude towards his guests for any reason ! the sundae was delicious but overpriced . i only come for dessert b/c their food is n't that great . it 's more of a tourist attraction .
0	the internet works great although i would argue if they really increased speed . my problem is with the cable . there is always an outage such as this morning again and always issues with the boxes ! we pay a huge bill each month and i can tell you there are many days each month that we gave a problem recording shows , the boxes , outages , etc . contour is an expensive joke . we will keep the internet which is also expensive but plan to try satellite for tv .
0	i can not speak of the food that i was told had great flavor and huge portions for the price . 45 minutes to an hour for a table , after 8 at night . we went across the street to the eastside cannery buffet . in town for a last minute wedding and since only staying for one night , we figured this place would be okay . the casino is tiny and to say it is smokey is an understatement . i honestly think the restaurant is larger than the gaming area . hard to play slots when older people are playing two or three machines at the same time . upon checking in , we were told all of the rooms have new mattresses . they might be new , but they are horrible . honestly , the floor has more padding under the horribly stained carpet . in room bathrooms are tiny . ironic that they are tiny , because instead of toilet paper holder being next to toilet , it is on the opposite wall . but hey , at least you get your morning stretching done while reaching for toilet paper . taking a shower is scary . water temperature level is a choice of slowly boil your flesh off or instantly boil your flesh off . i did n't even try to bathe my 9 month old son out of fear of causing serious injury . our room was on the backside of the hotel and i was kept awake most of the night by a fight in the neighborhood which is a stone 's throw away . amounts to ... it is a place to shower and sleep , but you ca n't do either one comfortably here . true case of you get ( or do n't get really , ) what you pay for .
1	classic all- american . top notch service .
0	this is just an unreal experience so i have to share . so i needed a gucci garment bag , i know saks has a mini boutique so i went over . now , i walk into the little boutique area , and come face to face with like 5 employee 's all staring at me like a deer in the headlights . ok , that was odd . next , a young lady walks up ... can i help you ? .... yes , looking for a garment bag .... this is where it goes weird . she says they have them , but not for sale . now i am the deer in the headlights look . so why would you have them , but do n't sell them ? odd she next says , would you like to see one ? now , this is the odd part . i say sure , i would like to hold it and not buy it . she proceeds top walk like she is getting it . obviously missed my joke . i follow , but after like 15 steps , as she is leaving the gucci boutique , i do mention , i wanted a `` gucci '' garment bag . she then stops and says `` oh , we only have the plastic ones that we give you when you buy a shirt . i stand speechless ...... she is like a deer io the head lights look again .... i say , so why would i come over into the gucci boutique , if i only wanted to `` hold '' a plastic cheap shirt cover ? she is still confused .... so i leave and go to the fashion square gucci store and buy one . this whole 10 minutes was so surreal , simply blows my mind . i mean why would i go to the boutique , and ask for a `` not for sale '' plastic bag ? and only want to hold it for a few minutes ? unreal , i bet she has a medical marijuana card .
1	the restaurant is rather nice , spread over two floors . having not been to any moxies prior to this , it was a very pleasant dining experience . the hosts and servers do their best to accommodate the customers ( when we were seated upstairs , and the noise was rather loud for us , upon request , they promptly seated us in the quieter downstairs section , which i prefer anyway ) . the staff , while new , are familiar with the menu , and able to recommend appropriate pairings to the items ordered . their selection of cocktails and wines is also rather large . the only reason they do n't receive five stars from me is that the chicken dish i had , while very tender and juicy , had too much salt . otherwise the seared tuna appetizer , my partners salmon , and the dessert was amazing and plated and presented in a very classy manner .
0	went looking for a place to buy some fresh stuff to eat so i did n't gorge on all the great restaurant offerings in phoenix and stopped here . we have these in vegas , but i 'd never actually been in one as i have my own personal fave grocery stores where i live . i do n't think i 'll be back unless vegas does it differently . you walk in and the place feels kind of old and grungy . the fruit and vegetable selection is small , but fresh looking . walked down the first aisle and came to the food that was about to expire , it looked like a dump . i was mortified and quickly moved on . still had that dirty feel all through the store . i really like that they have separate sections like american , mexican , etc . the portion sizes are just right and i got some soup , potato chowder , that was really delicious and a great price , too . i picked up some grapes that were n't great , but they were seedless . had a few and the taste was okay , but more than a few tasted off and most were really soft . i like firm grapes , what can i say ? picked up a nice bottle of some wine that i like . they have a decent selection at modest prices . they have a lot of ready-to-eat meals , but really the store is n't that impressive . this is the part that really hacked me . got to the check-out line , i guess they do n't have cashiers . waited and waited for someone to come verify my age over the wine . finally got there , but there was something wrong with my product not being off the belt so it was making this ridiculous racket . a really rude woman came over and told me to get my purse off the conveyor belt that was n't moving , when i went to pick it up she did something that turned it back on so my purse spilled out everything in it as it was going down . i asked her to stop the belt and she said she could n't because my purse was on it . right . i wish i could get it off but you turned the freaking belt on , rude lady . anyway , would n't return . i disliked the attitude here and the store just is small and gross looking .
0	it 's ok- last year we had golfland sunsplash season passes and were planning to go there again this year but when they had a one day only 12 hour super sale on season passes and i just so happened to be working a 12 hour shift that day-they peeved me into buying big surf season passes . now-big surf , is a bit nicer and more relaxed than sunsplash , but it could definately use some cleaning and care . the staff are mostly high school age and have no customer service or training-so next year big surf could save money on staffing and just hire monkeys or hyenas because either would do the job better than what 's working there now . if you go with really low expectations , you are going to have a great time . the food is mediocre and pricey . the parking is free and ample . the large wave pool is nice and full of pee . how do i know ? i never see anyone in the bathrooms . the slides are average . again , go with low expectations and all is going to be fine .
0	awful ! ! awful ! ! awful ! ! ! ! ! ! we have gone here several times . everytime we are met with unprofessional , rude , service ! ! ! the order is always wrong ! the crew definitely needs customer service training ! ! ! save your money or go next door to wendys ! do n't waste your time here !
0	subterranean , dimly lit , vaguely romantic restaurant that offers a cool `` old vegas '' vibe , but overpriced for substandard fare . valet parking at the four queens is slow and frustrating , i suggest self parking in the garage . i 've eaten here a handful of times , and the food seems to be getting worse and worse . table side flambeed duckling was dry and overcooked to the point of inedibility , tasteless steamed baby vegetables , fatty and overcooked meat , marginally fresh seafood , and a raunchy table side salad course complete with frozen baby shrimp , wilted iceberg lettuce , and sickly sweet dressings . service was fine , but nothing remarkable . the high points of this place are the knowledgeable and fun sommeliers , decent dessert cart , a palette cleanser sorbet course , and a cool ambiance if you can ignore the drunk tourists at the adjacent table .
0	how sad ! ! the food here used to be great , but alas , no longer tis ' so . stopped by to say bye to the bartender leaving for new zealand , only to find he had been fired ! the guinness bbq wings used to be delicious , but now they just taste like plain old bad bbq . the fish and chips was once really 'the best in town ' , now it looks and tastes like the frozen gorden 's fisherman 's fish from the grocery store . unbelievably the guinness did n't even taste right ! it 's better out of a can ! ! ! not sure what happened but with the original staff gone and the food now very poor and substandard ... sorry to say we wo n't be back !
0	this place is very loud , and very dark ( could n't see the menu @ lunch time ) and though the food was ok at best , the service is really lacking . i went with a group of coworkers for a b-day lunch yesterday and we all split the check ( paid one bill though , did n't `` inconvenience '' the server and have her put each meal on a different ticket ) . three people paid with cash , and two with debit ( including me ) . i had a water and a french dip , which was more like a cheese steak with some salty dipping sauce , ( the fries were tasty though ) anyhow when the server returned with my charge receipt i noticed my bill was about $ 2.50 more than i had anticipated , so i questioned why when i had a meal that was $ 10.99 i was charged nearly $ 14 ? she replied , and matter of factly i must add `` there was n't enough cash to cover one of the iced teas on the bill '' ... so i replied , `` but i did not have an iced tea '' e.g . who gave you the right to just charge me for something i did n't have ? ? ? ? she should have come back to the table and stated , `` there was not enough cash to cover one of your drinks , therefore , the bill was short , so some one will have to make up the difference '' not go ahead and just charge one of the cc because it was easier .... so this twit asks me `` uh , do you like , want me to take it off '' and of course she had a blank stare on her dumb face .... so being totally frustrated and in the name of time i told her no ( i feel the need to mention all of our lunches came out at different time , and she had messed up a few of the orders , maybe she should have written stuff down , so i did n't want her to drop dead with confusion ) ..... i should have forced her to ... anyway i have decided that i am going to call management today to express my malcontent ! update : i did contact the managers about the service issue i had and they offered me a free appetizer which i think is really nice , and good mitigation practices but i still wo n't go back .. just too many other good places !
0	i 've been going to this location for years , but recently it just takes way too long to check out . stand in one line that could wrap around the back end of the store at anytime . in the last three months it 's just been so bad i 've decided to just spend the extra coin somewhere else .
1	went again this past weekend and it 's official- i 'm in love ! excellent pad thai , and their house soups are pretty great too !
0	it is a small crowded place serving inexpensive and ok food . but i think it is over rated in yelp .
0	this is another chicago eatery but what sets this place apart from the rest in vegas is the breaded steak sandwich made famous in chicago by ricobene 's this is my sixth time here and i can say this place is going down hill and i will not return . the food is still good but i can see the quality diminishing each time i visit ... the service is so bad if you decide to eat here order it to go the server was nice but dizzy and spends way to much time sitting and talking with other workers and regulars at the bar so in turn you get cold food and if you ask for something you will get it at the end of your meal if you even get it at all .... now for the food ... my appetizer was deep fried raviolis they came out cold and half way in the middle of the meal .. the deep dish pizza was good but order in advance because it takes about 45 mins to get ... the breaded steak sandwich was cold but not bad for dessert we had the cannoli i liked it my wife said it tasted bitter
0	i have a big 5 in my neighborhood and found what i needed in the wrong size . i made a trip to the south east to browse some bigger stores and wound up here by default , as it was close by . i actually found what i was looking for and headed back to the shoe department to pick up some footwear for one of the boys . it 's a good thing i was n't in a hurry , as it took awhile to get the attention of one of the employees for assistance . the selection and variety here ( any big 5 for that matter ) is not as good as some of the larger sporting goods stores , but if they have what you need , the prices are usually pretty good ( especially sale prices ) .
0	somehow the online menu made me lose my appetite ? i cant really even explain why exactly ? my friend said it was '' good '' , so i checked out the menu , and well , yeah ..... get a different webpage , and change your name .
0	me and my wife stayed here the night we got married because she wanted to see the view the next morning . let me just start off by saying the view is the only `` nice '' thing about this hotel . a couple of days before our stay i called and asked for a bottle of champagne and some chocolates to be waiting in my room when we got there and told them exactly what time i was going to be there which they charged me for right then and there . of course it was n't in the room so i called down and asked them to bring it . they brought it up on their own sweet time and when they did they brought 2 bottles and 2 orders of chocolates and then charged me again for both ! trying to argue with the front desk about money was like talking to a wall so i said screw it and just paid for it 3 times . the actual room was set up nice and everything looked good until you looked closely . blood stains on the pillow cases and bed sheets , hair everywhere in the room , the shower drain was clogged so if you had the shower on for more than maybe 5 minutes it overflowed onto the bathroom floor and onto carpet . no complimentary breakfast , the layout of the whole building is annoying , you have to walk all the way through the casino to get to the hotel . i would not recommend this `` resort '' to anyone and i will not stay here again
0	i always get wings to go when i get off of work usually around midnight . never really had any problems until the other night . called in to go order about 1150. arrived about midnight . i knew it would n't be ready as soon as i got there which is fine played 5 bucks in the machine and paid for the food . 15 minutes pass after i arrive ( over 20 minutes since order was placed ) still no to go food in sight neither waitress i paid the bill with or bartender who knew i was waiting says anything to me at all . ok i 'll wait a bit longer before i ask . 30 minutes pass since i arrived ( 40 minutes since order was placed ) i finally decide to politely ask the bartender if he knows if to go food will be ready soon since i need to be home fairly quick . now i was not complaining when i asked and was polite in my tone with my question and the reply i got was rude and condescending in tone `` yeah it 's busy it going be awhile your not the only one waiting `` really ? the place had people in it but was n't packed by any means and i never waited this amount of time before . if i had been told `` hey sorry for your wait kitchen a bit backed up we apologize for the wait '' i would 've been understanding . it took over an hour from the time order was placed to receive it without anybody saying anything to me at all when they knew i was waiting . to top it off bartender just hands me the bag of food without looking at me and does n't say a word . terrible service
0	finally made it chompie 's after passing by it many times for work ! on service alone , i would give it 1 star for the waitress last night that kept looking at us but never came over until 5 minutes after we sat down . she barely even acknowledged us . on to the food : about 3-3.5 stars . the husband and i got the western sliders and the jewish sliders . i really liked the jewish sliders , although it is a very greasy / heavy meal . he really liked the western sliders . according to him , the tempe location is a lot nicer looking and has better service . i ca n't see myself craving chompie 's , but if i ever do , i 'll be sure to go to tempe .
0	i will never rent from them again . like everyone said , long lines ! also , if you decline the prepaid fuel option , they require you to provide a receipt for the gas in the car . it 's all in there in the fine print ! can i do a zero stars review , yelp ?
0	two stars for the food . the third star is for the ambiance . came here for a birthday dinner - cute place for a fun 21st birthday especially because they specialize in desserts . food and price reminded me of cheesecake factory . but definitely worst .. we shared some pasta , fried mac and cheese and salad ? oh and the banana split ice cream . this place gave me and my two other friends experienced a minor food poisoning right when we got back to the hotel . i actually held it in but for sure i caught myself gagging a few times . the other girls just ended up barfing it out .
1	i love bambino 's . it is within walking distance from my place and they have a great $ 16 special-lg cheese pizza and wings . it 's not world 's greatest pizza ever but it definitely gets the job done.check them out .
0	on our way to lady gaga 3/25/11 we decided to try this buffet , and as you can see it did n't go well . pro : no line / no wait at 6:30pm ( should have seen this as a sign ) con : dinner only for 2 adults was $ 80 + ( price did n't include wine or beer ) very limited food selection , very ! food was poorly prepared some items did n't tates right ( either bland or just straight up nasty ) did i mention over priced ? limited desert station served only soft serve ice cream , chocolate mouse , and creme brulee . this has to be the worst buffet i 've ever eaten at . i would n't eat here again even if the food was free .
1	as far as this location goes ( right inside the casino royal next to denny 's ) they are on top of their game . i have always had a great experience with them as far as purchasing tickets and asking questions goes . one important thing as well is that with the amount of people that go in such a relatively small locale , the workers there keep everything in control in a nice manner including the people waiting in line . certain individuals who work there would come outside as we were waiting in line to crack jokes with us , ask us what were looking to get , and have great recommendations as well . the employees there are awesome and trust me , they know what they are talking about . the best part is , they actually do have great tickets at an unbelievable price . i was able to go to get tickets for madame tussaud 's , carrot top , the goretorium and penn & teller all for about $ 100 bucks . that to me friends is a deal , and i do n't go anywhere else when i need to purchase event tickets . this is not a scam either which most tourists are afraid of as well . 100 % legit , friendly and informative . tourists stop here for the best deals in town .
1	this locations is perfect for me because i live and work in the area , i truly enjoy the customer service and the real and fresh ingredients used in their yogurt . its the second day of summer people , get down to yogurtland on stephanie in between sunset and warm springs . fyi its the cheapest in the valley , and you get to sample any yogurt of your choice for free . ; )
0	exceptional property , poor service . i do love this property and i come regularly , but i 'm always amazed at how bad the service is . i often get a casita or fairmont gold room and am always shocked that it takes me 1/2 hour to 40 minutes to check in . check out is a joke . this time i tried to check out on tv , which was broken ... so i called the front desk to ask if they could have a receipt ready for me , but the operator said they front desk was `` too busy '' to take my call . i explained i was just trying to check out and the tv option was broken and if i could n't talk to the front desk , how do i get a receipt . they offered to put me through to technical support to try and fix the tv . i explained that i was not interested in working to solve their issues , i just needed to check out and catch a flight . the lady actually yelled at me `` well , everyone else wants to check out too right now so you 'll just have to go to the front desk and wait in line '' . there were 30 people in line to checkout at the front and 2 people working . crazy bad service . so that was last week and i came back this week , only to wait in a line of 12 for one person checking people in . there was another person standing there and so i asked him ... '' are you busy ? can you check some people in ? `` , to which he replied he was just leaving for a break . so , again , we all stood there scratching our heads at the bad service . since i was only checking in `` quickly '' , i asked valet to just hold my car up as i 'd drive over to the casita . with the long checkin time , when i came out , they had parked it . then the guy tried to tell me i need to pay $ 40 for valet because i was there longer than 15 minutes . we argued and i won and after 15 minutes , i did get my car back . he now gave me the pissed off attitude as i went to get in my car . let 's see , i 'm paying $ 700/night , waited in line for almost 40 minutes to check in , you took my car when i asked you not to , i had to wait an additional 15 minutes for you to go get it ... and i 'm the bad guy . like i said , the property is gorgeous ... the service and attitude of the staff is just bad . i 'll be back with another couple in january and hope to avoid any contact with the staff .
1	this hotel is one of the top on my list , not too expensive but is great , love their pool and since i always stay here when i 'm in business trip is very convenient for me
1	i really like this place . it has a really great vibe and i love supporting the community while getting great food ! i highly recommend the friend flounder , collard greens & mac & cheese . delish !
0	you think they would be able to get an order for one med . pizza and a side of wings , ( $ 35 , $ 40 w/ tip ) right , but they ca n't ( my order was missing additional items that i was charged for but did not receive. ) . and when you 've already waited an hour for delivery , and are brutally disappointed , you call back to rectify the situation and all they offer you is $ 5 credit on your next order . pathetic ! ! ! there will be no next order ! p.s . i 'm afraid to eat the chicken wings , for chance of food poisoning . they looked under cooked . p.s.s . do n't waist your money and time ....
0	if you are craving pizza i think charlotte has much better spots to satisfy that craving
1	this place is great . old-school new yorky decore and delicious pizza . cool indoor/outdoor bar and seating . the pizza is thin crust and not as cheesy or greasy as your typical pie . so , keep that in mind if that 's what you like . in my opinion , this is just as tasty without being a gut-buster . the menu is limited to pizza , calzones , apps/salads/sides , dessert and drinks so be prepared for that . as in , if you want pasta you 're going to be disappointed as hell . p.s . - had the cheesecake the other day and it was money .
1	this is my favorite casino in town ! i 'm here at least once a week . the casino , and all surrounding areas are clean , and easily accessible . getting in and out of the parking lot is very easy . there are a couple entrances off of charleston , and two side entrances . two parking garages , and a huge parking lot or from , provides plenty of parking for customers . the standard rooms are nicer than any i 've ever seen . the suites are awesome ! my boss had a suite with 2 bedrooms , a living room , pool table and a soaking pool on the balcony . there are many amenities such as a great food court , bowling alley , and a great movie theatre ! the staff is the friendliest i 've encountered ! from the bars , to the cashiers , i 've always felt welcome . the sport book is the best in the area . any game , race , or sporting event is televised . the staff is the best . i 'm going to continue to visit this casino .
1	i think i came in here with the right expectation . i wanted a burger , some kind of pub appetizer , and a few beers , and that 's exactly what i got . service , good . beer , good . burgers , great ! and all for a fair price . my bf and i both ordered the bacon avocado burger , and i asked for the burger cooked well done . it showed up looking tasty , charred on the outside and juicy on the inside . bacon on the burger was crisp , and the avocado was fresh and tasty . i had the sweet potato tots , and bf had the fries , i ate all mine and cleaned his leftovers . they were both so good , just about the perfect sides for our burgers . we also ordered the pretzels , and while the cheese sauce was thin , it was packed with flavor . we sat on the bar side , was n't too smoky and we could vape at the bar . very friendly ! ! will go back when i 'm craving a burger again .
1	love the location , love the people watching , but mostly i just adore the modern tiki fish sandwich . it is my favorite menu item .
0	the macaroons were not very good and definitely not worth the $ 28 for the small box . they were too spongy and lacked any depth or flavor . bouchon has much better macaroons for the money .
1	tried the online ordering system for a pick-up and it was pretty successful . the chicken parmesan hero i purchased was great with the bread large enough to safely hold many cutlets inside . cheese and sauce also were on spot and for $ 8 , it was a nice filling meal . i added an order of fries for $ 1.25 which they forgot , but i caught the mistake before i left the lot . the fries were thin and unsusual as they were bendable , but still well cooked . pizza looked much better today and will be tried next time .
1	up until a few months ago , i thought i 've tasted coffee in the best ways possible . but to my surprise , the daily press makes coffee in even more unique ways than i 've ever witnessed . lindsey and her brew crew are experts at what they do here inside the shop . the attention to detail is clear in every single item on their menus . what sets them apart from the rest of the charlotte community is that they take specialties to an entirely new realm that i 'm now surprised to never have thought of before . drinks infused with bitters , house-made sweeteners in a plethora of flavors , sugar-rimmed glasses - shaken , not stirred . lindsey is a master of tastes and flavor combinations that i would have never been willing to taste myself . sweet potato ? in coffee ? citrus and lavender ? hibiscus earl grey latte ... ? they all sound so crazy but they all taste so - so - good . and it does n't even end there . these specialty drinks are made to be enjoyed in the atmosphere of the cafe . pomegranate arils , pie crust cookies , wobbly stemless glasses - details that most other shops would n't dare even have in their vicinity . all that to enjoy while you sit and observe and interact with the diverse neighborhood of noda and take in all the sights and sounds . the daily press and the people who comprise it , the regulars , and the passerbys all make the place an extremely unique venture , and a very welcome addition to the charlotte food community . i look forward to the seasons they prepare their specialty menus for , and hope they create a menu of their legendary seasonal menu items ( i already miss the citrus lavender so much ) . if you have n't had the chance to stop by , do so immediately . they 'll take great care of you .
0	love vs. hate four peaks has great beer . not just great beer but locally brewed great beer . nestled at once was an off the beaten path locale on 8th street in tempe , it now lies sandwiched between several local businesses and an avalanche of college student housing . and here is where the problems begin . hate : parking is beyond nightmarish and this is where the torment begins . the lot upon which 4 peaks is situated holds enough parking for roughly 20 cars . sure you can also park on what used to be part of the santa fe railroad , but even these coveted spaces fill up quickly . the neighbors are not amused by the amount of traffic that the brewing eatery produces and as such you can not park in any of the close by business lots even at off hours without your car disappearing via a towing service in a matter of minutes . the over flow of students and 4 peaks rise in local lore means that you will very likely end up parking either around the corner or so far away that you have to walk several minutes before you can even glimpse the well lit patio exterior . the walk is brutal in the summer time and frustrating any other time of year , but many a times i had made this walk knowing that the ample interior and patio would always have a seat waiting for me . but no longer . such is the crush and menagerie of the populace that now even on some week nights hostesses now hold sway over seating and my last attempt to simply stop in for a quick pumpkin porter were dashed by the half hour wait time and a bar full of people i wanted nothing to do with . so how did my once beloved out of the way tempe chill spots suddenly turn into a family dining establishments that draws from every age , creed and social base the valley has to offer ? simply put ; 4 peaks really is that good . love : it is a beer lover 's paradise with a massive selection of locally made suds offered up all year round . from heavy stouts to warm and keep at bay the nights chill to light , easy to quaff ales to chase away the summer 's heat 4 peaks has it all . while there are certain styles that i personally shy away from , you ca n't go wrong no matter what you order . not sure what you fancy , then grab a sampler platter . not a beer person , then order up your favorite mixed drink . one of the first things i did upon returning to this sun drenched paradise was swelter in the noon time heat sipping an apricot ale . more recently i through on a hoodie and made a late evening dash for something with a little more moxie to it ; the seasonal heavy weight of pumpkin porter . pumpkin porter might just be the greatest beer ever . ok , so that is totally not true but the fact that it is a ) good b ) seasonal and thus only available this time of year and c ) popular because it is so good makes it a highly coveted drink . so obsessed with this brewed beverage are i and my friends we are known to stalk the few local bars that buy 4 peaks beer by the keg and once the brewery is out we mercilessly descend upon these other locales like a pack of vampires and suck the taps dry . but alas , man can not live on beer alone and 4 peaks offers up a wide and varying range of excellent food to go with the hand crafted brews . think pairing food only works with wine ? not so and the folks at four peaks have been doing it for years upon years . after all what good is ordering a semi-gourmet lunch if you do n't have the proper pint to go with it ? pricing for the beer is decent and most of it can be ordered by the pitcher or even taken home in one of four peak 's custom growlers ( not so for the pumpkin porter ) . food is a bit pricey ( this is after all a brewery ) but worth the money . no cover and proper attire is never required . be warned , as mentioned parking is horrendous and if you want to relax and enjoy yourself pick off days and weekend days for the best experience .
1	i was very pleased with their service , so friendly and absolutely pleased to find such a wide creative variety of rolls they made . the list was very long and took me a while to decide what to get . having tried 3 : the manhattan roll , aloha roll , and alaskan roll all were pretty good not one was a disappointment , although its hard to mess up sushi , i 've had pretty boring flavorless ones before but theirs was far from it . my sister also ordered an entree and her portion was huge , they definitely were n't stingy . you would definitely be full if you ordered their dinner entrees . this place is definitely worth a try !
0	terrible . i mean , terrible . unbelievably slow . penn spent time ranting about libertarian politics . there were only about 10 tricks , some of them took 20 minutes , most of them hokey . all 4 of us fell asleep at some point . leaving the show , the audience looked depressed . vegas is famous for ripoffs : this one maybe the biggest
0	this place is way over priced for what you get , but the food is decent . i have had better at many other places in and out of vegas . the breakfast is way too overpriced to even attempt to get something . i ordered a bagel and cream cheese and that was $ 4.50 ! ! get over yourself palazzo , you are supposed to be a high class establishment , but the service we had in the morning was terrible . she was a middle aged blonde , who just was overwhelmed and not polite . we had a large party and had spent a lot of money this weekend . the service we had in the private room for dinner was much better and friendly , she should take some tips from them on how to act . i give the higher rating for the night service only . the veggie burger was the worse thing i 've had in a long time . the salad was disappointing and thai rolls were not great . i would n't go back ! i would say the decor and ambiance is nice especially in the private room .
1	my first poutine ( except for some home-made approximation made with brooklyn-sourced cheese curds , rapidly-cooling takeaway fries and underwhelming instant gravy ) was super . we queued for 30 mins on a cold sunday afternoon ( you always queue apparently ) but seating was democratic and well-managed . they do 20 plus types of poutine , and most are a riff on the original , plus add-ons . i had a savoyarde with bacon , onions , emmenthal and creme fraiche , my wife decorated hers with merguez , and another companion had a less successful iteration bedecked with breaded chicken bits . portions are generous , they split the bill per diner in advance ( student tourists must be a significant client base ) , and it 's cheerful . you ca n't pay with foreign cards so bring cash .
0	the staff has no idea about anything . i had one guy tell me when i was asking for a bell guy to `` ask the guy out front , but he will probably just tell u go somewhere else as well '' and outfront isnt a short walk . there was no ice machine in the whole tower i was in , but dont aak a staff member because each one will give you a differnt answer and send you on a wild goose chase for a non existant ice machine . checkin and check out takes forever . our keys where programed incorrectly somehow on the second day and we were locked out of our room and wasted over an hour trying to get a key to work ( the only exception to the bad service was a housekeeper who literally ran off and got me ice ) . with the distance from the main strip this place needs to do a much better job to make people come back .
1	really good dim sum , i recommend you try this restaurant . it 's impeccably clean , airy , and has very good service . we tried the pork shui mai , pot stickers , shrimp dumplings , hot and sour soup . ingredients were fresh , the food was not greasy and flavors were excellent . best dim sum i 've had in las vegas .
0	i 've been in pittsburgh for almost two years and this weekend was my first time visiting station square . i was a little surprised by it all . the image in my head was that it would be bustling with people like other similar venues -- boston 's faneuil hall and seattle 's public market on a much smaller scale . when i opened the doors to go in , i was surprised at how dead it was . a few shops here and there but no people . i went late afternoon on a saturday and the weather was gorgeous . my coworkers tell me that station square is more of a summer venue ; that there are a lot more activities happening then . some of the highlights are the location and the variety of restaurants .
0	amazing view to bellagio fountain show if you seat outside , the service ok but the food ... tho not horrible tasting , steak is pretty awesome but both times i ate there i ended up in the hospital ... yeah ! intense so when i was forced to go there again for a third time and refused to eat anything my friend who did eat the same awesome steak ended up in the hospital ... what 's wrong w their food ? ! !
1	i like this place . its a small cafe located by walnut st. you get a french feel and i loved the crapes . i had their walnut and cheese crape . it was franch , big crape with nice touch of syrup ...
0	garbage at it 's finest ! nothing like ordering a steak that is overdone , tastes like beef jerky , and hide the fact that meat is bad through over-seasoning it . the spinach dip was bad , the lobster bisque was watery and not hot . they ask if you want soup or salad as if it were included in the meal . what a scam ! better off staying home ! they can keep their cold food ! ! ! !
0	where do i start .. kaizen sushi is a japanese restaurant in front of the hard rock casino . or at least it tries to be .. first , it 's korean owned ( like most sushi places .. in case you did n't know , sushi rolls were invented in korea , not japan ) , they serve japanese food , but not traditional japanese cuisine , if that 's what you 're looking for ( try ichiza ) . i came here for sushi , and to my dissapointment , the sushi was not fresh , i 've been here twice and both times the fish was old .. from tuna to uni , the sushi was old and dry . not to mention the size of their cuts .. for the price they charge they should at least make up for quantity . i 've had an order of $ 6 nigiri that filled me up more than their $ 22 chirashi bowl ( mix sushi bowl ) . ok maybe not ... but you get the idea .. the only reason why they dont deserve a 1 star review is the fact that they have friendly people working there , and they are open later than most sushi places in vegas ( they close at 4am ) .. so prepare to order a couple of sapporo 's and sake , and hope it makes the food taste better .
1	i 've seen this show four times now under various circumstances , and each time , it never fails to impress . granted , the beatles were before `` my time '' , but i have always been a fan of their music , and the visual world that they created through their music . `` love '' brings that vision to life . there 's so many things to cover about love : the music , the theatrics , the representations of the songs , the realizations of characters from the songs , the side `` cameos '' from the beatles ... it gives the viewer the feeling that they are taking part in a live musical concert where the beatles are still doing their thing in the present time . the suspension of disbelief is n't difficult : the sound system is incredible . music flows around the theater , from within the audience seats , and there is always something going on at every angle . seeing the show multiple times is n't boring at all as i still catch things that i had n't seen from previous performances . everything is meticulously set up in the theater . even the lobby outside is just wonderful to walk around in and behold all of the detail and care put into everything . my recent favorite is the addition of a blue meanie in the gift shop . i 've had to curtail my fantasies of somehow kidnapping it and putting it into my home , but visiting it is almost as good ( almost ) . even the beverages in the lobby , while somewhat pricey , are big , and will definitely put you in a great mindset to enjoy the show . love was the show that i had to see when i heard of its opening , and still remains one of my favorite cirque shows . even though cirque has begun to shy away from its whimsical storytelling of old to focus on musical legends these days , this is one that i do n't mind seeing again whenever the opportunity presents itself . after all , all you need is love ....
1	kelly is an experienced manicurist .. she has over a 13+ years in salon work ..... she does gel polish , different types of hand designs , acrylic nails , silk nails and does great manicure and pedicure ... she is friendly and speaks fluent english ! ! ! wendy who once did my pedicure was amazing too ... after her work ... my feet feels like a babys bottom .
0	terribly mediocre . ordered the grilled pork belly ( i love pork belly ) most of it was undercooked . burger was pretty good , but not chef inspired at all ( just a plain old cheeseburger ) . subbed an artichoke for the fries- again it was undercooked ( could n't even eat it ) . so what i learned was , either grill was broken or the guy cooking on the grill was broken . also the wine list was meh ( and you could n't buy a wine by the glass- by the bottle ) .
0	look , i 'm trying to not be super critical here . they 're friendly , the store 's clean , and they want to help ... but their selection is sub par at best . they 're basically a large mall kiosk . if you want to buy an ego starter kit , or a low-end clone , or happen to particularly love pink spot juice ( which is all they carry , as a white-label brand ) then these guys are the ticket . if you want a legit juice brand , or a non knock off brand products you 're going to have to go elsewhere .
1	i came here with my fiance and another couple . we wanted to eat at mr. tofu , but they are closed on sundays . my fiance used to come to tofu hut a lot before discovering mr. tofu . since i have limited experience with korean restaurants , i will be comparing tofu hut with mr. tofu , which is directly across the street . the parking in both places could be better . tofu hut has more seating and was busier . some tables at tofu hut had grills built into the tables . as you may know , each meal comes with some complimentary sides . the sides at tofu hut are better . i like the fish cakes . also , they gave us slices of bread made from rice that was pretty good . i always order the same thing , bibimbap dolcet . they are equally good at both places . tofu hut gives you a large bottle of spicy bean paste . mr. tofu provides a small portion . the rice never got crunchy , which is my favorite part . i guess the hot pot cooled down too much before they could add the ingredients . perhaps an oversight because they were so busy . a careless mistake in my opinion . that is the best part of the dish . at tofu hut , bibimbap dolcet also comes with spicy tofu soup made with spicy bean paste . that was the best part . really good and hot . they add one raw egg . i love dipping the fish cake in the spicy soup . i think the price is similar . my fiance got her usual , which is tofu soup . it was not very good . our friends ordered galbi , bulgogi , and some sort of spicy chicken dish . the galbi was very good . the bulgogi was disappointing . the other chicken dish was really good . overall , i liked tofu hut better , but i doubt my fiance will agree , so you will probably see me back at mr. tofu . both are good .
1	i live close to this one so that means i come here often duh lol . but i love the bistros they 're so funny and i always get a great cup of coffee : )
1	so i do n't really know why this place got such bad reviews . i started coming here because it was much closer to my house and they offered the kind of personal training i was looking for . the staff is friendly and i have hardly ever seen the front desk not attended . i started personal training with john and i am very happy . i have n't had any problems with billing . they went over all the fine print with me and let me know about the annual fee and everything . very pleased .
1	i 've been shopping a lot at smiths lately for it 's by far the best grocery store in vegas . i get off work late at night and smith being 24 hours is really convenient . they have absolutely everything i could ask for from a grocery store . recently i wanted to get flowers for my girlfriend , it was 8pm and every florists was closed . i ended going to smiths and one of the workers help put together an arrangement for her . the customer service was on point . it ended up perfect . smiths will continue to be my grocery store for everything ! -joe
0	better have ear plugs handy , its noisey as many have stated . the raunchy biker bar hogs right next store is extremely loud thru most of the night and the bass comes right into your room . then the room fridge gave out , a cheap floor model . the casino is small and not worth stopping by . the rooms have adjoining doors and if anyone is staying there you can hear all . never again will we stay here . the best hotel around freemont is the golden nugget by far .
0	dude , the bartender was an asshole ! we just wanted to watch the fight , have a drink , maybe eat some food . when someone orders a drink you do n't respond by saying `` ... that 's it ? ? '' what a douchebag . good thing this place has lots of big screen tvs . he literally responded like that to everybody that ordered . i really wanted to order the nachos because they looked huge . actually , i did order the nachos then my friend ordered the bbq pork sandwich but did n't put in the order for my nachos and i paid for his pork sandwich . wtf ? he even repeated my order . good thing grand lux cafe is super close by . bad service put aside , i really enjoyed watching the fight here even though we had to stand the whole time . there was a good view of the tvs regardless of where you stand . it sucks that you have to pay $ 50 for a small table that only seats 2 people but hey how else are they going to make money ? i 'm so glad i brought sandals to change into ! ladies , have guy friend carry your sandals in their jacket pocket . you 'll thank me later .
0	the service would n't win any awards , but all the staff are incredibly friendly and genuine , which goes far with me . i like to chill out and get some work done here on my laptop over a few glasses of wine and the stuffed mushrooms are really , ridiculously good . like , crazy good . like crack . i have no idea what crack is like , but based on what i have seen from movies , i am going to guess it is kinda like that . yep , good times . good place . parking does not make all so excited though . free wifi though , score !
0	there are a couple of words that sum up ragamuffin 's style perfectly . the first one is pagan . the second one is glastonbury . we 're talking long , floaty dresses and shirts , baggy dungarees , striped trouser , sixties jumpers and chenille scarves . some of them are in bright colours , some in gaudy , darker colours like rust and burgandy . the over-all impression however , is free spirited , hippy wear for new and old hippies .
0	i am an extremely dissatisfied customer , i purchased a pair of running shoes from run for your life . as a frequent runner , i learned they had sized me wrong as i continually tripped and fell while wearing these sneakers . the store had sized me wrong , when i called the store ( over an hour away from me - and i noted this while on the phone with them ) to return the shoes for a different size , they said sure no problem and were as sweet as pie . however when i went into the store the ignored me and said rudely said i could n't return the shoes at that point . extremely frustrating , if i had been told that when i called i would n't have taken the time to travel quite a distance out of my way specifically go to this store . if there are other running shoes in your area i would go to them , this place is not honest and will do what ever it takes to make a sale .
1	great local spot for a meal with the family . get the steak dinner , it 's a affordable and delicious ! great because they separate the dining room from the bar area .
0	i have just finished dinner at romero euro cafe and i am extremely disappointed . it looked appealing from the outside and we were seated very quickly , however the remainder of our experience went downhill from there . first of all , the menu was overwhelming ; at least 30 different entrees and 20 separate appetizers . this should have been a clue regarding the quality of the dishes . nevertheless , we ordered 2 appetizers which took over 30 minutes to arrive and then our entrees followed in about five minutes . if the food had been spectacular , or even edible , the timing would have been forgiven . however , i truly believe that due to the large menu and quick turn around time that most of the meals were either pre-made or frozen . even the manicotti was unappetizing and could not be eaten . when we asked for parmesan cheese , we were told it would be an extra 1:50 charge . we left our meals untouched and the waiter did not look surprised . it was a waste of money and i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone . save yourself , your cash and your stomachs and frequent one of the excellent places across the street .
0	drink ... do n't eat . the environment , with the light rail shooting by , is definately a great place to enjoy an adult beverage . regrettably , the only thing cooler than the environment is the food ... as in the serving temperature . speaking of cold - i have a natural tendency to dislike any non-ice cream item served with an ice scoop ( like a grade school cafeteria - sides are scooped onto your plate ) .
1	pittsburgh has the most elegant bridges i 've seen -- there 's over 900 bridges spanning mostly over the allegheny river and ohio river . there 's a lot of interesting history about each bridge and the city does a great job maintaining the beauty of these structures .
0	i do n't know if it 's nostalgia or tradition to eat a meal at sam woo bbq in vegas since this was the go to place for some great roast duck and chinese bbq when chinatown first opened . but i think this was my last time and time to move on . the duck and chicken was terrible , and tasted like microwave leftovers . the only plus stars are for the clean restrooms and the fried rice . it 's sad that this place has taken a dive to the `` stay away list `` . cash only , always apathetic wait staff . no pics because even this photographer could not make the food look palatable .
1	we came here to celebrate my 24k golden birthday on saturday , september 29th , and they gave us table 50 , located on the southeast corner of the second floor balcony . we had one of the best views of the strip ! i ca n't remember our host 's name , but i think it was dominick . i absolutely loved him and our cocktail server , and i think her name was michelle . we ordered a bottle of grey goose , ketel one , and two magnum bottles of veuve clicquot , etc . everything was delivered and served to us promptly . their service was definitely exceptional , even with a jam packed club . our server and host were very personable and comical . they checked in on us about every ten minutes or so . our host and server showered us with confetti , but most of our friends went downstairs and missed it , so they were awesome enough to come do a second round of confetti just for my amusement . that totally made my night . lol ! what an awesome place to celebrate my birthday ! pure is a great nightclub . i highly advise that you get table service if you want to have more space and stay out of the crowds . plus , it makes people watching a lot more enjoyable . party it up ! have fun !
0	do n't try this thai ! for the first time in weeks my wife got to have dinner without the kids and decided to got out for on of our favorites , thai and try a new place -- bad idea . we ordered tofu soup , bbq chicken and green beans with shrimp from a very nervous waiter who was obviously very new . we order unsweetened iced tea to drink . we specifically asked to have the soup first . five minutes later waiter comes back and says that are out of tea . no tea in an asian restaurant ? really ? twenty five minutes later we finally see the waiter and wave him over . i ask him about the soup and remind him we want it before the meal . five minutes later we get the soup .... with no bowls of silverware ( another waiter get them for us ) one minute after we get our soup we get our meal ! by the way , the tofu soup ... had no tofu ! despite getting the meal with the soup against our wishes , we pressed on . unfortunately they gave us the wrong shrimp dish . it took us five minutes to explain to what appeared to be the owner/managers wife the mistake and another ten minutes to get the right dish . we try to eat the bbq chicken but it was so dry i actually got into a five minute choaking fit ... no one came to see if i was ok or fill my water glass that was empty for 10 minutes ! after waiting and looking to get the check we finally get it from the nervous waiter .... but it include the iced tea they were out of so we waited 10 minutes for him to ask him to remove that charge from the bill . 15 minutes later they come back with the proper bill ! ! my normally calm and understanding wife finally asked to speak to a manager . the older asian lady came out and told us the manager was not in and proceeded to blame the kitchen for all the mistakes and said `` i am only one person , i can not do everything '' frustrated we left our table . i noticed a older asian man walking around the restaurant so i asked him if he was the owner/manger and he said yes he was . i began to explain our issues with dinner and service , he incredibly lost his ability to speak english . we left vowing to never to return again . the old asian lady did give us a generous 10 % discount on our bill . that and the fact that i left a zero tip for the first time in my life made the meal inexpensive . i 'll give them 2 stars for that lol the owners should fire everyone , close the doors and find new careers . * * update * * after seeing this review , the owner 's son sent me a note saying he was sorry and offering me a free meal once they have their staffing issues resolved . i refused the free meal but said i would come back once resolved and if better , i would update the review . stay tuned .
0	cheeseburger pizza sounds great on paper but turned out to be nothing like as advertised ... there is actually plasticky american cheese thrown on top , not mozzarella and cheddar . in addition , the bucket of fries was not a bucket ... just a container filled with mooshy , greasy , cardbord things instead . to top it off , the cheesecake advertised as new york style is a chicago style cake that is pre packaged . worst food ever .... and all lies on the menu !
0	went to vegas last weekend for training . my cousin recommended goin to firefly and stressed on how good it was ... so we headed that way . i was hungry . hardly ate anything all day . training classes from 8 to 6 with only 30 min breaks in between hour and a half classes . had coffee for breakfast , and a nasty spring roll from a cheap ass wanna-be asian food place at the riviera . i was starving . we get to firefly and the place is packed . we were told it would be a 20 -25 minute wait . my stomach growled at me in anger . 20 - 25 minutes ? ? ? ? i just might pass out during that time . so next door was a different kind of fly .... dragonfly ... an asian joint . we proceeded to check out the menu posted on the window . as we were doing that , one of the servers came out and assured us it was really good in there . they enticed us with an available table right at that very moment . the place looked pretty cool inside . not too big . one small bar in the corner . cool dragonfly decor on the walls . some kind of anime porn projecting against the wall ... that was interesting . the service was good . our server was actually really nice and very helpful . i had a raspberry margarita . it was n't too bad . they had a pretty big selection on the drink menu . i started with a miso soup which was actually not too bad .. i then had a volcano roll and it was ... eh ... ok. portions for very small , and not very cheap . and i was still hungry . so my friend and i decided to split a sampler with some rice . ( we 're so filipino . ) probably not a good idea since the beef was pretty much raw , the chicken was too salty , and the meatballs were too mushy ... overall the food was eh . next time i 'm waiting for firefly .
0	one of those restaurants where you go in , and go `` huh , why is it sooo empty '' . albeit it 's a wed nght , but it 's also restaurant week ... i even felt like we owned the entry area of the theodore .. never saw a soul except a desk guy hidden in an alcove . park in the adjacent buckboard lot , as there was a sign stating guest parking $ 10 though i did n't see an attendant who could collect . 4 people , all a variety of dishes from the very promising sounding menu so we definitely had the works . it just did not wow . i appreciated the papardelle pasta was freshly made ( but kept tossing overboard to my bf the mushy bland short rib meat ... mid week leftovers ? ) and the meyer lemon tart . general repeated comment re : our mains ... salty . now i can see this being a place for lounging and drinks , especially if they were to draw those curtains down around you to cozy up your table . but i want to like the food too .
0	the service is good with very high internet speeds . cable tv is high quality also . the prices however are ridiculous ..... the price hikes all the time make me want to lose my lunch
0	cheap & cheerful . jason 's deli is quick and easy . order and pay when you walk in and they bring the food to your table . lots of food choices and of course good deli food . the best part about jason 's deli is the flaw in service . none of the staff notice all the freeloading . now i have never freeloaded , from here . but everyone just goes up and dips from the salad bar , taking all the cake they could possibly desire . why would you pay for a fountain drink when the cups are right next to the machine ? my little brother especially loves jason 's deli because of all the candy laying out and specialty soft drinks in glass bottles . i ca n't tell you how many times we have had to empty his pockets and send him back or make him pay for the drink he has casually walked off with . despite all the looting happening right before your eyes jason 's deli is basic restaurant where you ca n't go wrong .
0	this shop is hit or miss . it 's usually dirty and the customer service is lax . go to the human bean down the street instead .
1	all . you . can . eat . steak . what more can the inner carnivore of every man want ? you start off with the salad bar to get your stomach warmed up for the main course : the meat ! when you 're ready for the main course you flip your card over to green and the chefs swoop in like seal team 6 and carve out pieces of steak onto your plate . seriously , i would n't be surprised if they dropped in from the ceiling when you flip your card over . you definitely wo n't have to wait long trying to flag a chef down . moreover , if you 're waiting for a particular cut of meat the chefs ask what you 're waiting for and sends the appropriate dish to your table asap . my favorite has to be the house special ( picana sp ? ) , but you ca n't go wrong with anything on the menu . service is definitely the best in the business too . all the servers and chefs are attentive , and the manager has greeted my table personally every time to make sure everything is perfect . this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants , but can get expensive for dinner , so come around lunch time where it 's cheaper and still has the full menu !
1	nice slice of history . the inside of the mon incline is very museum like and i think would be a great place for out of towners to get a glimpse of historic pittsburgh . at the conclusion of a work related awards dinner at the lemont , i had to get myself home . i was feeling both lost and overwhelmed because besides that night i had never been to mt . washington and it was after 10pm . i walked up the street and seemingly out of no where happened upon the mon incline and i am so thankful . no sooner had i went into the trolly station was one boarding . if you are ever inclined to go to mt . washington for a day the incline is the way to go .
1	if you want a wonderful meal in a wonderful setting served by the friendliest and most professional people you could hope for , this is the place you want to go to . we had the truffle tasting menu . everything was spectacular with a generous shaving of truffle on every dish . there 's not much else to say , to me it was just a perfect dinning experience and a badly needed one after the two horrible dinners at wynn steak and milos .
0	it would n't be a vegas nightclub if there was n't a long line . i go to every club there expecting a long wait . to top it off , i 'm a dude ( girls do n't know how good they got it ) . we are treated like peasants , tossed around in different lines from upstairs to downstairs , getting cut by groups of girls or `` vip groups ' that just tip out the bouncers to get in . the left side of the entrance , people crowd up like animals waiting trying to get the bouncers ' attention like dogs waiting for their treats . this place is a hierarchy . friends of bouncers , people with money , and girls get in . everyone else , the average joes just wanting a good night in vegas got ta pay a ridiculous amount of money , wait in line 3x longer , and literally get treated like crap . i remember walking in line with a 3 of my male friends . it was already 1am and there was a small line in front . right as i hopped in , he told us to , quote me on this , `` gtf '' out of line . no explanation , just get out . -_- after three different visits to vegas , i finally managed to get in because i was part of a cousin 's group that lived there , and they had friends . the place definitely does have it highlights , but i was n't blown away . i had a better time at xs to be honest . also , if you happened to not workout your legs the week you go , do n't worry . there are plenty of flights of stairs to get them quads fired up . nice entrance , okay inside , not good for groups of guys . bring girls , wad of cash , or make friends with people there to get in . just my two cents . : )
1	after visiting sincity vapor ii i basically said screw it and was gon na keep smoking but this review isnt about them . i checked yelp looking for other vape shops and this place popped up seems like they just opened . i was real apprehensive about vape shops in general so decided to call before i headed out . the owner answered the phone and i had a very good conversation with him that ended up with me coming down a few hrs later . he was very knowledgeable , answered all my dumb questions without making me feel like an idiot and bottom line i walked out of there with a little less money and alot happier . i have now been back multiple times for juice , advise and just to hang out and bs and every time its the same . greeted as soon as i enter the door no matter how busy he is and they make you feel like you are old friends . this is a new store but they are adding new products regularly ( mods , batteries , clearomizers etc ) and new juice flavors all the time . they have complimentary wifi , tv , and coffee i have no reason to go to another store keep up the good work . oh and their prices are amazing
1	the common market is the best place to go for single good beers- they even let you drink them in the store or on their patio . besides having a huge selection of beer and wine , they also have a deli during the day-time that makes great sandwiches , etc . i also love to browse the candy and assorted treats that the common market offers . this place functions as a convenience store and a deli , but at night it also becomes a hang out for hip locals who wants to relax on the patio and drink and smoke cigarettes . open until 2 am ! !
0	accommodated large group quickly . food was very slow to come out . everyone was somewhat satisfied with their food . service was very slow . very good for studying or working alone as you wo n't be disturbed too often .
0	this place was disgusting to say the least . everything had a very off taste to it like it was spoiled/stale . the rice looked a day or 2 old . we took one bite of the food and our server crushed a roach right next to our booth . yep that was it we paid and left and went and got a burger else where . this only got a 1 star rating because i ca n't rate it a 0 !
1	the best margaritas ever ! great service , although i got a salad with salmon on it that was rancid . they replaced it with chicken and it was great . i suggest not getting seafood there . my sister had great tacos but said the beans were mediocre . will return !
0	in vegas for work , looking for something vegan ... most steakhouses have great veggie sides and i was not disappointed at old homestead . i ordered the heirloom beet salad - without goat cheese - wow , it was so good ! perfectly prepared beets and the vinaigrette was nice and tangy . for my `` entree '' i ordered a side of mushrooms , broccoli , asparagus , and the roasted corn - outstanding . the corn was definitely the best , the others were pretty standard fare . minus a star for no vegan entree ( not a surprise though ) and no dessert . most places at least have a sorbet . pricey , yes ( $ 100+ for my meal , plus 2 glasses of wine ! ) , but it is a nice place , great ambiance , even dining solo at the bar . kudos to the staff for not making me feel lame for ordering just veggies in a steak place . they were very kind & accommodating . much appreciated !
0	they do an okay job , but i find this place is very expensive and while they do an ok job , they do n't do a great job . you can find the same or better manicure near by , for half the price .
0	this review is based on my first visit here on 7/23/11 . when i arrived to the hotel , i was surprised that the restaurant was located in a very busy corner near where you purchase la reve tickets ; however when you walk inside the restaurant the atmosphere changes . the lights are dim and the decor is simple and elegant . the kitchen is somewhat open and it was fun to watch the chef , the cooks , and the runners in action . our server was attentive and friendly . cocktail of choice : pitcher of margarita ( pear i think ) . it makes about 4 glasses and was served on the rocks . it was sweet , sour , and tangy with just the right alcohol . it would have been better if the glass ring was salted . bread basket was yummy but served cold . the best part was the fresh pesto dip it was served with . appetizer ( special ) : trio of artichoke hearts . approximately 2-3 pieces each were fried , raw , and stuffed with goat cheese . my favorite was the stuffed artichoke . wish there was more of the brown balsamic sauce on the plate as the raw artichoke could have used it . the fresh pesto was a good substitute though . soup : pasta e. fagioli : good portion but this again to me was just so so . tasted a bit bland and could have used fresh parmesan and fresh crushed pepper corns but it was not offered . entree : pasta carbonara : i know that the pasta here is suppose to be made fresh daily and that was what i was so excited to come here for ; however the fettuccine seemed so thick and was hard to chew , i could n't tell if it was fresh or not . it was served with 2 egg yolks on the top which made the sauce even creamier . also a good sized portion . this visit was just a-ok for now but i will return to try the bosco pizza everyone keeps raving about and write an addendum ... maybe with more stars .
0	i 'm glad jim gould 's exists , so there 's somewhere nice to go in champaign for a special date that is n't biaggi 's or whatever . but man , it 's just not worth the price . good things : the waitstaff is nice and patient , attentive but not overbearing . making reservations was a breeze . the ambiance is lovely , and i think they do live music on weekend nights . i remember being there once and hearing live jazz , which is cool . the food : meh . i had the dry aged new york strip steak , which was good .. but i 've had way better steaks for the price , and even better steaks for less than we paid . it came with whipped potatoes and `` seasonal vegetable . '' the potatoes were skin-on half-mashed red potatoes . how is that whipped at all ? ? the `` seasonal vegetable '' turned out to be the biggest disappointment : it was essentially green beans from a can . come on ! ! green beans are n't hard to get right ! they 're even good frozen and steamed ! the beans were seriously the kind of thing i 'd expect to see on the buffet at ryan 's . the wine is ridiculously overpriced . i did n't even bother ordering any , because i do n't even like wine that much . stuck with the blackberry jasmine iced tea , which za 's does better for half the price . i did n't even see the bill , but i assume it was a bazillion dollars . i know my entree plus a wedge salad would be 29.95 + 6.95 , so i figure it was $ 60 before tip , easily . boyfriend is a fancy gentleman and kept me from doing my usual nosy restaurant cost analysis . i was n't upset by the experience , but next time we have a fancy date night , i 'm going to suggest going elsewhere .
0	just dined there this evening , and we were fairly disappointed . the food was very nicely prepared , tasted just fine , however the service left a lot to be desired . and the worst thing was that both our dinners , and my coffee ended up at our table lukewarm . if you ca n't manage to bring items to the table hot , than the rest of this review begins to hardly matter . the waitress was snippy , not friendly in any discernible way . the water and coffee were very slow to be refilled , in fact everything was slow about the service . they brought out our entrees while our appetizer plates were still on the table ... and they had been sitting there for some time ! one of them never did get picked up . from here , i hardly feel the need to mention the screaming baby , the pretty italian music that got cut off halfway through our meal , and the confusion/staff bickering that we encountered when we first arrived ... but there you go . they told me they have been in business for 20 years , but they still ca n't seem to get the most basic components right . overpriced , and not a good experience . try someplace else .
1	great new place for pizza ! owner very friendly and helpful , offered us complimentary garlic knots with marinara sauce ( yum ) . pizza slices are very tasty and made fresh . oh and the slices are huuuge ! ! did i mention amazing prices too ?
0	does vegas need another steakhouse ? in a word ..... vegas needs another steakhouse like it needs another sugar factory ! ( ok , that was 10 words . ) especially at the prices they 're charging at this place ! everything from the steaks ( $ 56 for a 26 oz bone-in ribeye ! ) and the sides ( all $ 12 , even the duck fat fries ! ) are obscenely overpriced .... ( damn you , casino-revenue-sharing ! ) the meat ( imported from new york so it must be really good , right ? ) is no better than mastro 's , prime , carnevino ( also obscenely overpriced ! ! ! ) , joe 's or envy . the wine list is good , but not spectacular . the service is slightly better than adequate . the bread-basket is ok , but ordinary : ( hey look ! it 's pretzel bread ! wow . ) the decor is cliche new york club-style ... ( close your eyes and poof ! you 're at pj clarkes ! ) there are better choices at better prices all over town , so i wo n't be returning anytime soon . but the place was packed ... so i have to assume it 's either captive hotel-guests who did n't want to leave the premises ... or a bunch of people partyin ' before the mayan apocalypse . by the way , i passed on the $ 12 desserts .... went to the sugar factory .
0	vorweg muss ich sagen , dass wir als europ\u00e4er sicher kein authentisch-chinesisches essen zu bewerten wissen . allerdings haben wir einige erfahrung mit scharfem thail\u00e4ndischen essen , aber dieses hier hat uns absolut nicht geschmeckt . die gerichte waren sehr unterschiedlich , einige halbwegs lecker , andere einfach nur eint\u00f6nig oder viel zu scharf . die bedienung war sehr unaufmerksam , hat die meisten fragen nicht verstanden und die meisten bestellungen beim servieren nicht einer person zuordnen k\u00f6nnen . leider ist auch die atmosph\u00e4re des restaurants eher imbiss-artig , so l\u00e4uft zum beispiel ein fernseher und die tische sind relativ klebrig . auf unserer rechnung war schlie\u00dflich auch noch das gericht , welches ausverkauft war . insgesamt haben wir unseren aufenthalt \u00fcberhaupt nicht genossen und sind so schnell wie m\u00f6glich wieder gegangen .
1	so happy to have a great burger place in the neighborhood ! i have eaten there a couple of times and really love it ! the house sauce is so yummy ! ! i thought the staff was very warm and welcoming !
0	horribly disappointed in the banh mi ba le special . i used to come here a lot until they went cheap on the sandwich . the meat were sliced so thin you can see through them . i get pissed off everytime i open my sandwich and all i see is veg and jalapenos . dakao , i quit you .
1	i am in the area temporarily and i needed to get my nails done . it was hard finding a place i felt 100 % sure about . i went here because of all the great reviews and i am very happy i did . i called and made an appointment for the next day with lisa . when i came into the salon , lisa greeted me right away and showed me the colors to choose from ( they have lots of gel color selections ! ) . lisa was super friendly and so was the other woman in the salon ( michelle , i believe ? ) . i asked about the glitter they had , and lisa let me know how they do it ( it 's called rockstar ) . i 've never had such pretty glitter nails ! i told her she had spoiled me and i 'll never want plain nails again ! they turned out gorgeous and i 'm so very happy with them . the whole experience from walking into the store and walking out was perfect . this is the ideal nail salon . friendly ladies working there that make you feel like you 've been going here for years . i can not recommend this place enough , i will definitely be back before i leave . thank you !
0	cool place with plenty of beer choices . service was n't a highlight . guy with dark curly hair needs to rethink the service industry .
0	terrible flour chips . salsas bad , no heat , one like watered tomatillos and balsamic-yuck . vegetarian menu a joke . 'veggie mix ' on everything . one person had a decent steak chile relleno , thus 2 stars . it 's not really mexican food . do n't bother .
0	the charm and decor of an old time ice cream parlor with the horrible service of the present day . the silverwear was dirty and my ice cream was used with a dirty scooper , while else would cookies and cream have hints of praline flavor ? nevertheless , ice cream is ice cream and who does n't love that ?
0	every time we are at downtown chandler , my husband and i talk about this place . `` we still have n't tried the new steakhouse '' . at first i saw all the negative reviews and did n't want to go anywhere near it . then , as their star average improved , i added it to my huge bookmark list . we still did n't end up going there for a several months because i was waiting for a time when we were properly dressed . it seemed like a classy kind of place . i always peeked in there wistfully as we walked around the corner to paletas betty , eyeing the candlelit white linen tables , well dressed couples sipping martinis at the bar and catching a few notes of jazz music wafting out the front door as the pretty hostess in her little black dress opened it wide while greeting patrons . our actual experience there did not live up to these expectations . when you look a little closer , you see there are paper placemats on top of those crisp white linens . and the smooth jazz music gets overwhelmed when the restaurant is more than half full and is absorbed into the annoyingly loud din in the place . and the bar ? no draft beer , the bottles they do have are $ 5 a piece ( and they must store them warm b/c the hubby got one that was so skunky he could barely finish it ) and the markup on the wine list ( by the glass options ) was high . i paid $ 10 for a glass of something that would cost $ 16 a bottle retail . i am giving them an extra star because my fillet was cooked perfectly and was very tender . but this may be due to the fact that i always order my steak medium well . from the other reviews , it looks like if i had wanted it rare i would have been out of luck . the sweet potato fries that it came with , however , were bland and undercooked . a huge disappointment since i really love sweet potato fries . these tasted like they came frozen in a bag . and the generic , supermarket brand bag , not even alexia or the ones they have at trader joes . do n't even get me started on the salad . a sad little pile of extremely wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple of slices of cucumber and some croutons . i know it is a steakhouse and so most people are just there for the meat , but seriously it was pathetic . one of their specials that night was that you could add a small lobster tail to any steak for just $ 10 . i was super excited about this since i love lobster . it was served out of the shell , always a plus , and with both a lemon wedge as well as drawn butter . unfortunately , no amount of butter could drown out the overwhelmingly salty taste of the piece of rubber in the shape of a lobster tail that was on my plate . i wanted to complain to my server but she was mia for most of the meal . by the time she reappeared we just wanted to get out of there . i doubt we will return .
0	okay , i do n't understand why everyone is giving this hotel so many stars . ( i find it funny some of the reviewers actually work there lol ) i went for the first time this weekend to see damain marley and nas in concert . now , just pulling in to the hotel was already a bad experience . i am pretty sure that the guys who designed this place ( both inside and out ) were on acid when they did it , and just scribbled on some paper . it was worse than trying to figure out a labyrinth . i valet a lot , and even before i had ever been to the cosmo , i was warned by a couple of different friends that the valets have a tendency to steal . one friend actually had his ipod touch stolen out of his arm rest , and they refused to do anything to replace it . anyway . i pull in to valet to see `` valet full . '' okay , that 's weird for a new , hip , hotel but it happens . my boyfriend rolls down the window to ask about self parking , and hears a worker tell another patron say , `` no , it 's not full . there is just no valet at all . '' huh ? ? ? so we go to the parking garage and the sign says there 's 100+ parking spaces , buuuuut there were none - on more than one floor . the garage itself is poorly designed , as if they just tried to fit as many cars into one tiny space as they could . parallel parking spaces in a parking garage ? seriously ? it took us almost an hour just to find a spot . and that 's just the parking . when we walk into the hotel , it is gorgeous . the art is digital , hip and pretty cool . the chandelier is amazing to look at . aesthetically , the cosmopolitan is very pleasing . however , that 's about all the props it gets . i asked a worker where to go to pick up tickets , and they said `` i do n't know . i think the pool is on the 5th floor , though . '' ( despite the sign right next to him saying that it 's on the 4th floor . ) apparently , `` i do n't know '' was the phrase of the night for most of the staff , because nobody knew anything . two people actually directed us to marquee after i asked them where the boulevard pool was . some of them did n't even know about a concert at all . communication much ? after asking 8 different people ( no exaggeration ) , and 30 more minutes of walking around , i finally found one man who told me where to pick up my tickets . did i mention the inside is just as much a maze as the parking garage ? the escalators are not close to eachother at all , and i felt like i was going in circles . i was dizzy by the time i reached will-call . needless to say , chances are , i will not be going back . for a place that is supposed to be new and hip and for all the hype it gets , that 's all it is - hype .
0	i had an appointment with the genius bar because my power button does n't work on my iphone and i still had to wait around for 50 minutes before the rudest manager approached me . the 'manager ' jim was arrogant and disrespectful . immediately you could tell he was not going to reason with me because my iphones warrenty expired 4 days ago ! i did ask if he could work with me since i contacted apple 's online services a week prior and they told me it was a malfunction with my phone and to come into the store . the warrenty was never brought to my attention , not to mention how about a grace period ! jim , being full of himself , said of course he could help me ; i just needed to pay for another iphone at full price . this is the worst customer service i have ever received in my life ! warning to all : do not go to this apple store .
1	i love this little shop tucked away in fashion square . too often people that i know think that sprinkles is the best cupcake place that the valley has to offer . sprinkles is honestly at the bottom of the chain for me . too pricey for a tiny cupcake with zero flavor . what i love about caketini is that the cupcakes are much larger in size for a smaller cost , and they taste deeelicious . my favorites are the salted caramel and strawberry . they have a huge selection that you will have no problem finding one you like and will want to end up buying more than one because you can not decide ! always generous with the frosting and sometimes you get a surprise in the middle . they also do cakes for events and have cakepops . have n't tried those ... yet ! last time i went there were 1-2 fruit flies which was pretty gross , but i 'll be nice and hope next time they take better care of the problem which i had never seen before . overall , i recommend it !
0	the worst of the worst ! ! unreliable ! ! will not answer her phone or return messages . even worse , if you 're ( un ) lucky enough to get an appointment , she does n't show up or have the decency to let you know she has to cancel ! ! she just blows you off ! ! please , do yourselves a favor and blow her off ..... out of business ! ! ! ! * * * * follow-up to my review : unbelievable , she had the nerve to say that i was `` confused '' about when my wife 's appointment was ! ! claims it was for tomorrow , after she called me the day i scheduled the appointment , on her website , saying she was confused and was looking at a past appointment confirmation ...... tonya , find some other `` non-customer service related business to be in , this is not for you ! ! ! ! ( and maybe stop lying when you screw up , i can understand mistakes , but not lying ! ! ! ! )
1	these gentlemen are amazing . my son loves barber shops and when we moved i was worried i would have a hard time finding a new place . this place is perfect and my son came home very happy with his haircut .
0	the only positive thing about glass nickel is that they 're open late . the quality is horrible compared to what they charge . they have yet to get one of my orders correct ( simple things like extra side of marinara and i get ranch ) and when i call about it they do n't even seem to care . i 'm officially done from ordering from them and i do n't recommend them to anyone
0	my husband was excited to take me to cafe porta alba for what he said was great pizza . i know that it is authentic neopolitan pizza , but if having little to no taste whatsoever is authentic , then i 'll pass on authentic . bland ! ! ! i love sauce and cheese on my pizza , both of which were lacking in quantity and taste . the crust crunch on the outside and chewiness on the inside was good , but i do n't go out to eat for crust . i should 've tried the pasta instead . i compared my experience here to that of villa dolce in middleton . villa dolce 's pizza had much more flavor worth paying for .
1	excellent experience . salon is over-the-top nice . great concept . the service was fantastic and you can tell the owner , rod , takes great pride in his salon . rumors are they 're going to open up a shop on the east side . hope so as the drive from henderson was a bit far . worth it though .
1	one of my favorite restaurants in scottsdale ! what a great find . super convenient location . great service . excellent food and reasonable prices . loved all the varieties of guacamole and the peel and eat shrimp were delicious ! ! ! ca n't wait to return and try more of the dishes .
1	i love these gadget shop / hawkin 's bazaar type of shops . gim me gizmo is a clone of one of those and it is great fun . with toys and games available to play this store is the posterchild for fun . it has every type of miscellany you could imagine , from robotic hamsters to air cannons , to more adult toys such as boob mugs ( i still maintain there was a lost 'jugs ' advertising opportunity there ) . this store is ideal for birthday gifts , secret santas and other similar giftgiving opportunities . you can pick up something funny for a few pounds , or if you are looking to spend a bit more there are more complex things that go anywhere up to about 40 or 50 quid . the yard of ale glass is always a good present for a lad who thinks he can drink loads , and the bath basketball ( or 'bath-ketball ' as it should have been called . god someone needs to get me in advertising ) is always a good laugh . the toys are often novelty based and will get old after a while but the sheer amount of them means there are always more to keep you interested . for those who like to have fun of a different kind , there is an adult section at the back , filled with erotic dice , sexual board games , unusual toys and all the stupid paraphernalia you can expect to find on stag and hen nights .
1	i ordered the after the rain bouquet for my mother 's birthday and its was truly gorgeous . they also completed it in less than 2 hours after i submitted my online order . i will be using them in the future .
1	upscale thai food . the restaurant is very nice and clean . the owner came by and made sure that we were happy with our meals . my wife and her friend got the tofu spring rolls . they said they were very good . the `` peanut sauce '' did n't taste like peanut butter ( which is very good ) and had a nice bite to it too . yellow curry with tofu ( uber spiced ) was very good as was her friend 's eggplant ( also uber spiced ) . my musaman short rib had great flavor ... only problem is that there was n't more : )
0	i was in and out of the terminal a location in under 20min . the service was quick and the food acceptable . it was much milder than i prefer my mexican food , but a safe bet before a 5hr flight . a bit over priced , but that 's expected in an airport .
0	came here for the casino and to see a toucan that they said they had ... this place is a old casino . it reeks of cigarettes and heat ... came here to see a toucan for my friend but they had a parrot that only shows up on the weekdays . outside the flamingo smells like bird and fish poo and it just was n't interesting .
1	i had spent the day at the grand canyon and was totally exhausted by the time we made it to the show . but wow ! was i blown away ! its a very different concept than most cirque du soleil shows . the rotating stage is very impressive , and the show is very entertaining . the performers did a formidable job at keeping everyone on their toes , and the music was beautiful as well . i would recommend this show to anyone going to vegas .
1	this is one of my favorite thai restaurant 's ever ! ! i wish they had moor seating because they 're always busy . the food is wonderful ! the staff are super friendly . i 've had most of the menu at this point and everything has been great !
0	this was not good at all . i ordered fish tacos and i got a vandeekamps fish stick in a tortilla with tartar sauce .
1	incredible breakfast ! i love coming here everyone in in vegas . i have tried most menu items and they are all fabulous . must try if you have never been here .
0	we were excited when our closest sweet tomatoes location was reopening , however , we wo n't be coming back . we will continue going to the locations that were n't turned into a field kitchen at one point . the salad bar is missing way too many items , the beverage area is too small/awkward and the soup/potato area is also a squeeze ( and i 'm a small person ) . it 's not worth having to wait in line for soup , not having enough items on the salad bar and being unable to get to the ice machine because people are piled up around the ice cream .
0	our family decided to give cibola vista another chance in august 2012 after a horrible experience the first time we visited there in 2010. our first mistake was in thinking that maybe things had changed over the two years since our last visit ... they changed alright ! we thought that it could not get worse ; we also wrongly thought that getting the very best high end penthouse suite would help sweeten the experience ... wrong ! ! ! the room was a disaster , dirty , smelly , no wi-fi , some kind of biological or other fluid all over the tv remote , with only half of the light bulbs working , urine still sitting in the toilet , air-conditioner only cooled the room to 85 degrees after 6 hours . the towels and linens were dingy and smelly . the washer and dryer was completely inoperable , and the sudden gushing stream of water from the rooftop ac condenser unit into our bathtub at 11:30pm did not bother us , as the `` adults '' partying in the unit below us and wandering around the resort in a drunken stupor were louder than the flood in our unit . when we called the front desk to complain we were politely told that they were sorry and would have someone look into it ... 5 days later still partying loudly ! the incessant barking dogs left locked into units barked all night and day did not seem so bad after the copious amounts of vomit still left in the elevator at 11:30 am one morning from the partying the night before . people just leave their trash sitting in the hallways hoping someone will take it to the dumpsters for them . the bbq grills are not cleaned frequently , as there was left over fish of some kind all over both of the ones by our unit three days in a row . there were no recirculation pumps for the hot water system so it took forever for the water to get hot in the mornings . and our whole unit was absolutely infested with crickets ! live crickets were in the toilets , sinks , showers , bed , hallways within the unit , and don '' t open the lower cabinets if you do n't like bugs ! we had to sweep up dead bugs every morning before starting our day . the pool while looking inviting , was disappointingly warm , with the skimmers not appear to be working , lots of unrecognizable floating debris , and green slime around where the water level in the pool was . but even that was comforting compared to the boisterous behavior of the unsupervised , unruly , drunken fools in the pool , it was not even safe enough to let my 5 year old daughter into the pool . the teenage inexperienced `` lifeguards '' that were supposed to be on duty were so busy hiding from the situation behind the slide that they could not have helped anyone anyway . if you are looking for a dirty , trashy , nasty place to party like a porkey 's style college dorm , then this is your place ! if you are looking for a family vacation in a reasonably clean and quiet location look elsewhere , as cibola vista is a dump , with management , maintenance , facility , and customer service issues ! very dis-pleased that this is how my time-share money is managed ! we will never return to this facility .
0	the service was slow we had to remind the waitress to bring us our water the food was okay . with no leadership taking action , we had to go up to the counter ask for parmesan cheese and also give them the check and the credit card so we could leave . the food is mediocre at best for the service to be so slow , especially in las vegas given all the competition a great places for places to eat . it 's okay you have all the time the world . i do n't plan on returning any time soon
0	decent for a quick meal . a little pricy ... i mean almost $ 4 for 16oz bottle of water ? ! but i digress .. philly cheese steak was good . tenders were fresh but a little too much batter . some fries were soggy , i like mine extra crisp . anyway for those 2 meals , onion rings , large soda and bottle of water it was $ 40 !
0	the casino itself is not great . its small , outdated , and limited poker action , which is my thing . only one table playing , and i think it was just a tourney , its the only game i play , so i normally wouldn'tt come here . but the food deals are fantastic for vegas . prime rib special was a great deal . granted , its not a top quality peace of meat that you will find at expensive vegas restaurants. , what you will get is a decent meal , large portions , and short on cash . you ca n't beat it . just do n't expect a 5 star steak .
0	we decided to check this place out since it looked like a casual dining spot and was close to our hotel . my sis and i were n't too hungry so we ordered the fondue pretzel dippers which i do not recommend . we had thought it would be a soft pretzel but they turned out to be those hard pretzel sticks you can buy at a cvs . gross . also the accompanying cheese dip was too salty for my taste . giving this place an extra star only because our waitress was nice
1	always like the fresh hot food here . my favorite is moo shu pork , a delicious mix of pork , veggies and egg with moo shu wraps . service is quick and portions are huge ! i 'm sure green valley is no match for china town , but in the 'burbs i love to go go go here !
1	this place is wonderful . its located in tivoli village which makes it convenient for shopping after your meal . along with the decor and ambiance this place definitely stands out with outstanding food choices . i recommend the blueberry waffles . it comes with a large variety of sauces ; maple syrup , nutella , butter , strawberry jam , as well as cinnamon sprinkled whip cream . absolutely delicious !
0	decor was beautiful . service was spotty but friendly . food was surprisingly bland ( fillet mignon , calamari , prawns & sauteed mushrooms . ) spent $ 89 . maybe it was an off day . received a nice apology from management on line after review .
0	les plats en ont peut-\u00eatre le nom , mais ils n'ont absolument rien de fran\u00e7ais . les croissants ne ressemblent pas \u00e0 des croissants , pas plus que les croque-monsieurs \u00e0 des croque-monsieurs . ajouter \u00e0 \u00e7a les 15 minutes d'attente pour un vulgaire espresso alors que la salle est \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 vide ... le + 1 : les serveurs fran\u00e7ais , un vrai plus pour ce lieu qui revendique cette origine . le - 1 : le service terriblement lent . le + 2 : la grande terrasse . le - 2 : le lieu situ\u00e9 dans un coin de rue compl\u00e8tement ... isol\u00e9 .
0	something seems to have changed over time . their hash used to be fantastic , now ... disappointing . bummer . time to find a replacement .
0	* * * e go cafe is located in the renaissance hotel and their greek yogurt parfait is pretty good -- topped with sweet and crunchy granola , good candied pistachios , and fresh fruit ; unfortunately , the lines can really build here ( due to its small size and kitchen ) and the prices are high ( but that is kind of the case with food in las vegas ) * * * like most hotels in las vegas , the renaissance hotel offers both valet and self parking .
0	absolutely horrible customer service ! the worst best buy i have ever visited . my family shops at best buy from wilmington to johnson city and this is by far the worst place we have ever been . i do n't usually write these but they irratated me to no end not once , not twice but three times . it started last year when i purchased a new laptop to replace my 4 yr old one ( which i also bought at best buy ) . the geek squad did not listen to my concerns and wiped my old laptop clean without contacting me as they stated they would . i lost a lot of important information ! then stating that both my computers were ready ( while contacting the wrong person over and over again ) . when we went to pick them up they were not ready , and this happened 3 times . back and forth a total waste of time . then guess what happens a year later , the same thing ! ! after having to wait for 45 mins for them to even find me in their system ( i had spent the extra money on the one year plan-which they magically could n't find 6 months later ) . still no contact to pick up my computer 7 days later , after they stated it was ready and guess what happened after i drove out of my way , it was n't ! their response `` oh , huh i do n't know what happened there ! '' not even an apology . called again 3 days later to check and oh all of a sudden it was ready just that second . only to find out that it was n't installed properly by the geek squad to begin with which is why it messed up . total lack of respect for customers and total idiots that obviously can not read directions and dial a phone number correctly !
0	we used to eat here once a week because it was that good . the last take out a couple days ago was so disappointing , and we ordered our usual favorites : panang curry and pad woon sen with shrimp . panang 's taste had changed and the pad sen had a chewy piece of meat in it ( i ordered shrimp ) and some sharp small bone-like things that almost made me puke when i spit them out . i used to think this place was 5 star also , but you only get 2 when you mess with people 's food . * sigh * i 'll give it a shot one more time , but the once a week visits are over . it 'll be a few months before you see me again . so long sakun thai
0	trying too hard to be the hip place . perhaps the most uncomfortable chairs i have ever sat in at the bar but the atmosphere was very festive the early friday evening we were there . the sweat potato tortilini was not only meat free but creative and delicious . but for the price left both of us needing a second plates . there were too many negative factors to give it a great review , just average .
0	i visited lv recently , and wanted to visit the aria casino . i did n't drive there , but i quickly learned that you absolutely need to drive there . the directions and maps to get there are horrible , they 're confusing at best . the entrance is a so far from the real strip . i felt like an israelite travelling through the desert . it looks rather cheesy on the inside , and just not worth the time and energy i spent to get there and play . never going there again ...
0	what a waste of time . been here before and it was fine . i had no problems . apparently , the people who work here kicked my friend out of this place , for no reason . and ? my friend got jumped right outside of that place .
1	i love hanging out at this bar ! it may not be very commercial or mainstream , but that 's the best part ... the mom n ' pop shop : ) they host fun events like slot car races , irish trivia during st. patty 's day and have old school decor like official chairs from wrigley field ( it 's a cubby bar ) and a phone booth . i 'm a fish n ' chips fan and the garlic knots are delicious ... but if you 're particular about bar food and super attentive service , this might not be your joint . it 's more of a neighborhood hangout where people can get to know your name if given the opportunity .
1	i am back ! my first experience at nora 's was great ! me , the hubbs , and his mother all went to grab lunch - and seeing how moises loves pizza , and him seeing their yelp reviews we decided to try it out . the service at the time was very attentive and classy . drinks never went dry , they let us know of the bread charges - when some places do n't . the pasta dishes felt home made , pizza and the crust yummy . my boyfriend is from brooklyn , so he is a bit of a pizza snob , and loved this . we loved the garlic bread , it was toasted good , fresh garlic on top . not only did i love the food , moderate prices , but i really loved the atmosphere . it gave the good old las vegas vibe , with frank sinatra playing in the background . it 's a part of las vegas , not a lot of appreciate - but i felt it in here , that is love . i marked down a star because we came in the next day for dinner , and the service was n't that attentive like it was for lunch the previous day . it was pretty packed , so i 'm not going to knock on them for it .
1	i wanted fish fry last night , but we did n't feel like driving , so we figured we 'd give dexter 's a try . ( it 's 3 blocks from our house . ) my first impression was that this place does n't belong in madison - it belongs somewhere much farther north . there was an awesome mix of people there , which is always a good sign for me . they had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs ( not just basketball , hooray ! ) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard . we were seated immediately ( pretty good for a friday night ) and placed our drink orders . my boyfriend got a great lakes irish red something or other , and i ordered a pyramid winter ale , which was n't all that great . i personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu , but aside from that , i ca n't really complain about the selection . for dinner , i ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup , and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries . our food was amazing . this is hands down the best fish fry i 've had outside of da nortwoods , definitely the best i 've had in madison so far . the soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro . i did n't try my boyfriend 's burger , but the chili garlic fries were awesome . i 'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic , though , so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover . i am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house . we will definitely be going back soon .
1	decent coffee , great location . large patio on the lake , lots of wandering ducks , grassy areas to sit on . downside : smokers ! everywhere ! this seems to be a place for the hipster crowd to hang and smoke . so unless you like cancer fumes , you have to sit inside in the evenings . friendly staff .
1	i normally do n't write reviews on here unless the place spectacular . i moved to las vegas in january and i had yet to find a good masseuse . i definitely stay away from the chain massage places and the extremely expensive spas on the strip . then this groupon pops up . 90 minute massage for $ 59 . um hell yeah ! conveniently located for locals and tourists . so i actually work at a spa , and i am so quick to judge , you could say i 'm a massage snob , but dj at djanel is my new bff ! the atmosphere in his spa is so calming , relaxing and there 's no way you could n't feel comfortable . dj was so friendly and we chit chatted for a bit before my massage , but the second the massage started , all he asked was if i was comfortable and if the pressure was ok. i appreciate so much that he was n't trying to small talk while i was relaxing . he is extremely educated and you can tell he loves what he does . i 've never felt more relaxed after a massage than i did after my massage with him . i will definitely be coming back to see dj at least once a month because he is affordable and a great masseuse .
1	first off , thank god for somewhere in the area where a veggie burger is under $ 12 . thank god . healthy food is made affordable and accessible at this cute , bustling little 'grocery ' and for that , i thank you , lgo . your breakfast burritos , veggie summer rolls , and nutritious salad/sandwich selection are all truly appreciated by us health-conscious folks on the go . second , wtf are you doing sticking your butterscotch buns and peanut butter pies and fatty chocolate ten thousand layer cakes in my face when i 'm trying to get my vegan on ? ! come on . i literally played `` if you could eat a whole one of these without getting sick or gaining weight , which would it be ? '' with my friend while waiting in line . there 's that much to drool over .. and i resent all of it ( promptly buries face in veggie burger and turns 180 degrees away from the pastry window ... only to see the grateful spoon looming in the distance ) . bottom line : lots of healthy choices , and lots that will absolutely kick-start anyone 's mission to induce type-2 diabetes . update- everyone be warned : the breakfast burritos are incredibly bland . both the venice beach and the chorizo burrito taste like nothing but the salsa they 're accompanied by . nutritious ? yes . filling ? absolutely . an adventure for the taste buds ? far from .
1	i 'm here for the first time at a conference . conference stays do n't always afford guests the opportunity to fully explore the amenities , but this much i can say for sure ... there 's only so much you can do to make people comfortable when it 's closing in on 110 degrees outside ! lovely property , `` lazy river '' , quality restaurants , and friendly staff . rooms are nothing to write home about ( nice , but nothing too out of the ordinary ) . close enough to all types of shopping , movies , and bars/restaurants , in case you feel the need to leave the resort . one piece of advice -- park close , or pay for valet . walking to your car mid-day can be a life-altering experience . i swear i saw a mirage as i was walking in from the parking lot yesterday !
0	i have to update my review due to a very shocking experience . despite the store having a lot of cute stuff , they sell fake merchandise too . i was fooled into buying prize only gloomy bears , and the items are wrapped so its difficult to inspect tags . another thing i noticed was an alarming number of fake san-x goods , particularly large sized rilakkumas . i do n't know if the store realizes these are fakes , but i do not support any store that sells counterfeit merchandise .
0	after reading reviews i decided to come here and i was totally disappointed . the only reason this place is 2 stars vs 1 star is the very polite , make your own , pasta chef . all the food was very bland and the prime rib was dry and tasteless . for the price it is a decent bargain but i would rather spend some more money for better quality of food . the only thing that was tasty was a potsticker i had otherwise there was nothing to even discuss .
0	two stars for a wide selection and offering delivery service to my area . portions are a bit small and quality a little blah for the price . also , my experience with their fried food has been hit-or-miss . i had the best spring rolls on my first order . delicately crispy , not greasy -- indicative of a skilled hand , the right oil temp and just the right amount of time in that oil . unfortunately , two subsequent orders resulted in the same soggy mess which one can get anywhere else in town . i 'll still use them for delivered food a couple of times a year -- and on the off chance that the skilled fry cook returns -- but really prefer to go elsewhere for my indian , thai and chinese fix .
0	decent gel mani . prices are a bit high , but i had a sweet tech- nobody was snooty when i was there . mani lasted 2 weeks . 5 stars for anyone that can last 3 or more ! !
1	i have been going to flo 's since it opened - remember the tiny location by safeway ? my fav is the hot & sour soup- lettuce wraps - hot & sour soup oh yeah i love that soup here- we give flo a big high five for the best happy hour in the n scottsdale area . 7 days a week all items 1/2 off all wine , beer all half off not the chinzy house wine only thing that other places do . all food items on app list 1/2 off - not 4 or 5 items - like the cheap pretenders in the hood - that wonder why they are n't busy ? ! ? ! ? go to flo 's for hh - and thank me later when you see your check ! !
0	dishonesty at fry 's electronics on line : at 5 am thanksgiving day i went on line to purchase the 32 '' sony led tv using code 4373787 @ 98.00 says unavailable ? how do i get 1 at this price with the free delivery as advertised ? the original email i received tuesday said that item was online only . now with a diff code # it says instore only @ $ 129 . i got up before 5 in the morning to give u business and you screwed me ! i was online on your site at exactly 5am . you guys have sent me several unacceptable replys such as : ( unfortunately , we experienced an issue with our database on thanksgiving , resulting in our entire site shutting down temporarily , with occasional issues over the next few days . we regret this occurance happened at such a significant time and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that you experienced . our website functionality has been restored and you may continue to explore our great deals at frys.com/ads . we thank you for your patience and hope that you 'll give us a chance to provide you with great shopping experiences in the future . again , we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused you . please let us know if we can be of further assistance .. i can wait it 's not a xmas gift . honor your ad or lose customers forever ! )
1	this one is not in walking distance of my apartment as i mentioned earlier .... lol ... it is however a very good target . i just wanted to update this review to get the facts straight . eat , drink , and be merry my friends ! ! ! !
1	consider this a real salon . a place that you would wear makeup and decent clothes to . i showed up in my most unflattering work outfit and i was feeling a little more than uncomfortable . thankfully , my stylist mandy did n't prejudge me and was willing to take her time discussing my new cut and highlights . she had lots of good ideas and i ended up with really good cut and some new blonde highlights . i 'd definitely go back to her .
1	updating my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because i 'm still talking about those grits !
0	this market has so many items to choose from . there is a food court inside that serves some pretty fresh good food . everything in the store is either organic or natural and the prices reflect it . the service is good and the whole decor is very pleasant .
0	good food , clean and friendly service . the prices are a little high for what you get , but this is one place everyone in our family can agree on .
0	i like the fact that there were 3 rooms with 3 different styles of music because if you do n't like a song which happens to me quite often in the club you can go exploring for something better . what i do n't like was the ridiculous wait in line and all of the questionable ladies in the club ( by questionable i mean hookers ) i know its vegas but come on .
0	visited for the first time yesterday ( thursday ) , but left without a purchase . i had a few questions concerning some food allergies , but the clerk behind the counter almost did n't care , and it was almost like i had to twist her arm to have her call someone for the info . i mean , these cookies are $ 2.50 a pop , and i 've seen , and eaten , larger-portioned fantastic all-natural cookies being sold for less than that , and for a possible sale of at least two cookies ( and lord knows how many return visits i would make based on how much i like these cookies ) , the clerk did n't want to make the call ? ? she actually grimaced . ( funny , but the clerk next door at chill out did n't want to call the company that supplies their cookies , either . ) oh , well . their loss ... i had decided then and there that i could n't , and would n't , go back to tammie coe again .
1	this was the most amazing chandelier i 've ever seen ! loved the 3 level bar and the chandelier just surrounding you while drinking the $ 12 drink . it feels like your in a elite hollywood setting with beautiful people around you . great place to socialize and to relax and admire the crystals all around you . your in vegas . just indulge yourself ! !
1	one word .. amazing ! my boyfriend and i were in las vegas for 4th of july weekend and had heard about giada 's . we already had dinner plans , but since we are such big fans of hers , we decided to check it out for a late afternoon bite . as we waited for the doors to open at 5 , we used giada 's photo booth which was such a fun start . we were promptly greeted and showed to our table upon opening . we were greeted right away from a very friendly cocktail server in the lounge . my boyfriend order the giada cocktail and i had their blood orange martini ( it had a much better name but i forgot ) both were delicious.we ordered the burrata , bacon stuffed dates and the mushroom pizzette ! all were to die for . we decided to also order a chocolate orange specialty espresso and my favorite .. polenta cake ! not to sweet , but absolutely delicious this restaurant has a great atmosphere and an exceptional attention to detail . from bev naps , to flatware , to all different station ( pasta , bread , espresso , antipasto ) to the `` g '' carefully crafted in out espresso and cocktails . we were also very impressed as the manager went to every single table in the restaurant to personally introduce himself and shake everyone 's hand . we will definitely be going back to giada 's , and if you are in las vegas it should be on your list of places to go .
0	got a mani-pedi here while i was home for spring break . the location was super convenient and extremely clean . i was greeted when i walked in and promptly shown to a pedicure seat since i had an appointment . i really liked that they had a manu available for you to choose different treatments during the pedicure . its sometimes hard to keep track of add-on charges and the menu made it really simple to get what i wanted and to know exactly what i was going to pay . the massage was great and my toes look wonderful ! she even did a second coat of glitter over every toenail for me ... now onto the manicure ... i had already been there for an hour and i could tell she was beginning to feel a little rushed . the hand massage only lasted a minute or two , i did like the neck massage , although that was super short as well . i paid $ 25 to get a white tip gel manicure and i 'm really disappointed in the quality of the gel . friday , the day after getting them done , both my thumbs have huge chips in the white . when i get gel it usually lasts a week or two before any chipping occurs . overall it was a decent experience , but id probably try another place in the future just due to the quality of the paint .
0	i recently moved to las vegas from new york . the plan was to move into madera , but did not sign becausethe apartment was in sub-parcondition , and misrepresented ( unintentionally ) . although the property manager ( yvonne ) was delightful and did everything in her power to make up for the barrage of mistakes , the vp of ovation properties , wendy white , is a disgusting and rude person . she is entirely unreasonable and childish . i not stress enough how unprofessional wendy white , the vice president is . during this time , we viewed all ovation properties within summerlin and realized that they are all over-priced , and not even close to a decent value . in all , this was a horrifying experience , and an unnecessarily stressful way to start off a new life in a new city . i will never , ever reside under ovation properties solely because of wendy white .
0	mediocre at best . nothing was outstanding - for the prices , i had much higher expectations .
0	the best thing that i can say about my stay was that the room & bathroom was clean . the front desk service was horrible outside of their normal check-in / check-out responsibilities . asking them to call or a cab was a disaster , the front desk offered the shuttle service but could only drop me off a half mile from my location . not being from pittsburgh and not having an umbrella ruled out a stroll in the rain . the bed was extra firm with a hump in the middle . and my attempt in the morning to iron my dress shirt was an epic fail as the iron burnt an imprint of itself in my shirt . the desk attendant , tony was sincerely apologetic for my stay .
0	went there several times . but i have to say i really do n't hate the food here ... the food is really fast food and everything taste weird ...
0	stopped in for brunch and now it is dinner . as is sit here with my empty drink i would love to be able to review the food but do n't think that is going to happen . i guess it needs to be 5 in the morning to get good service .
0	this place is horrible ! they have been calling my job and trying to collect debt on a person who shares that same first name as me , but not the same last name . they call me about 5 times a week ( at work ) and i have told them over and over they are calling for the wrong person . ive had to start monitoring my credit in fears that someone had compromised my ss # . thank god all is well , but the final straw was when joe gallo called my work pretending to be a metro police officer ! i finally reached the supervisor there at acsi who was nice and told me he would get this taken care of ( let 's hope he keeps his word ) but i am filing a report with the better business bureau . imitating a police officer has gone too far .... especially when they are harassing the wrong person ! !
0	i wanted to take my mom here for her birthday . i passed three empty tables in the outside seating area on my way in and asked for a table for 3. i get told there is a 15 minute wait . not a minute later a group of 4 walks up and is seated immediately at one of the open tables . i go in and ask about this and get told there 's `` not enough staff to cover those tables '' . i enjoy coming here but this was rude and disappointing .
1	wow , just wow . i came here not really knowing what to expect . i tried it for the first time today and i already ca n't wait to go back . the layout is much like chipotle . the two dudes that were working were super nice and super helpful . it was my first time so they let me try a couple things and gave me advice on what was best . ready for this : i ended up getting a bowl with rice , fried eggplant , some sort of broccoli , chicken , lentil kale salad , red onion , tomato , a little bit of tzatziki and jalapeno cilantro hummus . with a wheat pita on the side . it was nothing like i expected but oh my god it was absolutely amazing . all of the flavors just meshed together . you taste a little bit of everything , but it 's almost like you do n't taste anything separate . you just taste one big bowl of all these different flavors formed into one . words really do n't do this place justice . the one thing i will say is do n't be scared to do something a little out of your comfort zone . i told them i do n't like eggplant , they had me try it and it was the best eggplant i 've ever had . some of the stuff they have there might seem a little out there , especially for someone like me who has a very american pallet . do n't let that scare you and trust the people that work there . if you are n't afraid of something a little exotic , you have to go here . if you are a little afraid of exotic , you have to go here . this is one of those places where you just ca n't go wrong .
1	this place is pretty much a jamba juice on steroids . if you do n't know what a jamba juice is , forget about it , and enjoy your tropical smoothie . they have more options as well as healthy food selections . i will be back before i leave the vegas .
1	pros : reasonable price friendly staff great selection of gel polish good massage chair easy to walk in or set up appointment gel color will last long time next to sushi catcher : - ) cons : limited staff so they can do pedi and mini at the same time weak pedi massage and scribing this is my go to place for now ...
1	this is one of my mom 's favorite restaurants in town , so we all went there for her most recent birthday party . the service was great , we enjoyed the waiter 's enthusiasm and courtesy . the meal was also very good . first time trying escargot and i have to say it was quite a treat . the onion soup was also a hit , great flavor with a perfect amount of cheese baked over the top . the only reason i am not giving this 5 stars is because they discontinued my mom 's favorite dish , so she was somewhat disappointed . we all ended up having a great meal and a great time nonetheless and will come back .
0	had to send my food back , pasta was tough and sauce tasted like a can of chef bouyardee ...
1	nice place to get a reasonable price meal in vegas . i stop by everytime i 'm here in vegas . the service is immpecable and the waitress uniforms are a plus side ..
1	have n't read the reviews but already know what people will complain about . it 's not at the big rental car center , so you take one shuttle there , then another to the rental car place . threw me for a loop the first time i rented here , too . but after renting here 2 other times as well , i can safely give this place 4 stars . each time i rent , i just book the cheapest deal i find on rentalcars.com , usually only $ 22/day with all taxes , then go there and upgrade to a sweet convertible for only $ 20 more a day . it 's an incredible deal ! there 's nothing like cruising down the strip with the top down at night , believe me . the people have always been nice to me , even when i changed my mind about which car i wanted and they had to re-do it all . even the shuttle driver is a cool guy , and i chat with em everytime i 'm out there . obviously , the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the off site location , but it 's also the reason they are cheaper than the competition . i did n't experience any line issues , or shuttle issues . but i should mention that i arrive in vegas at 11pm local time , and depart around the same time , so it 's never very busy . my time also is n't so valuable that i ca n't deal with an extra 20 minutes coming and going to save big bucks on a convertible compared to what the competition wants for one . from a vegas veteran who 's tried many rental car places there .
1	when it comes to massages , i prefer deep tissue over swedish . after i read other 's reviews about thai massage , i decided to give it a try . i booked for myself and my husband . bottom line is i love this place and i will most likely to return to this place . it 's a full body massage from head to toe and you 're completely relaxed and energized after an hour . and the price is insane .
0	this spot was all the hype it was even on the news . we went there last night . and was very disappointed . the ribs was fatty . no banana pudding and no peach cobbler . no potato salad . we wo n't be coming back . very small dining room .
0	i hate to give such a terrible review , because the food was actually decent . i went there during the christmas holiday in '09 and got massive food poisoning ! ! ! my poor mom had to stay in the room with me the whole weekend because i could n't stop throwing up after the meal i had here , making me miss the show i had tickets for . even worse was having to sit for 4+ hours on the ride home back to la while i felt this way . i can never go back there for obvious reasons .
1	my rating on bagel nosh is really a 3.5 stars but i 'm rounding up to 4 stars . the reason this place is not 5 stars is that about half of the time when i 'm eating let 's say an egg bagel , sometimes there 's another flavored bagel taste on my bagel . i do n't know if this happens because some of the other flavored bagels get mixed up together or it comes from the knife that they use to butter up all of the bagels . sort of like mixing tequila with vodka and you do n't like vodka . otherwise , i really enjoy the fair prices , friendly owners and the chill atmosphere with plenty of seating . i only wish this place was open on sunday .
1	love this place ! the pizza crust is perfect , not too thick and not too thin . the tomato basil pizza is so tasty . in the spring & early fall i love to sit out on the patio , if you 're brave enough to sit out in the winter they have heaters . love the inside/outside bar . live jazz on tuesday and thirsty tuesday and thursday $ 2.00 drink specials
1	just found mosaic and got my hair done by angela . i absolutely love it . she took her time to listen to my concerns and my hair looked gorgeous . will be back soon ! ! the salon is very chic and everything is super cute . thanks angela : )
1	we bring our chihuahua to pretty paws . the service here is excellent and the prices are great . not to mention how you can tell the staff loves what they do . it shows when we pick up our dog , in how clean she is . they have this neat little playpen where our dog waits for us to come get her . i will continue to bring khloe to this excellent groomer . thanks pretty paws , keep up the great work !
1	the hamburger . oh , you poor , misunderstood sandwich . so many people treat you like a fall-back . when people say , `` eh ... you just want to grab a burger ? '' it causes tears in my eyes , and great gnashing of teeth . and i can only handle so much gnashing . however , there is a place out there , a place that adores and cherishes you , you faithful friend , you . holstein 's , located in the cosmopolitan of las vegas , is a gourmet burger joint that mixes classic with funky . that 's pretty obvious when you sit in their leather-adorned lounge area complete with a pink-and-white cow . ( by the way , we 've named her `` holly holstein . '' run with it . ) the burgers did not disappoint . my friend had a `` hen house , '' a classic hamburger topped off with a fried egg . never had egg on your burger ? you 'd be surprised . i had the longhorn burger , a bbq burger topped with brisket . fantastic . no stale burgers here ; each bite was succulent , as if a little miniature chef was on our table crafting every bite just at the time we ate it . holstein 's has about 34 million beers on tap . ok , maybe not 34 million , but a lot . we did n't have any alcohol , as it was only noon and neither of us were in the mood to drink yet . ( in vegas ? no ! yes , you have to detox sometime . ) that would be my only complaint about the place , they really try hard to force the alcohol on you . we were asked about six different times if we wanted a drink or if we had looked over the bar menu . the first three times we said no should have been an indication ; by the sixth time i wanted to say `` yeah , if you 're comping it . '' i 've heard the shakes are killer ; it 's definitely on my to-do list next time i come . and there will be a next time . oh holstein 's ... shut up . just shut up ... you had me at `` hamburger . '' ( by the way , when you go , find the painting of the robot in the lounge , and tell me he 's not being a little obscene . just saying . ) ps : full disclosure here : i work at the cosmopolitan of las vegas , where holstein 's is located . however , as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees , i have been honest in this review . i am also not affiliated with the f & b department .
1	ordered from them last night , the owner or manager was really cool . his delivery driver took off early , but he zipped out himself for the last delivery . pizza was very good , cut into squares , lots of cheese , great ingredients . the only thing knocking them down to 4 stars , is they are pricey . not even just pricey , but almost overpriced . i 'm sure if you 're just buying a couple slices over lunch , its not bad , but as a whole pizza , its expensive . a large cheese pizza was 16 bucks , another 2.25 for each topping ( i had two ) , add on tax and delivery charge , and the total was 24.75 , not including tip ! ouch . good pizza ? yes , its very good ! good value ? mmmmmmmmmm , not so much . try to find a coupon just to make it normal priced .
0	the pork tenderloin sandwich was good with sweet baby rays bbq ... but the shrimp was better . the fries are closer to shoestring style , not a fan . had the stella artois cider , pretty decent .
0	terrible service and they ca n't efficiently handle a party of 11. we had reservations for 7:30pm on a night that we needed to leave by 8:30pm to make a show . we told out waitress this and she said no problem . my wife ordered a soda from the waitress and it never came . they put us at the end of the table , right where the walkway for the wait staff was . two out of three of them bumped into my chair each and every time they went past . i scooted in as far as i could go . the menu is al a cart , so get ready for vegas food price gouging ! at 8:32pm , our food still had not shown , so we left . went to the show and had pretzels and beer . when we left we went back to the ventian , but not to lavo . not ever ! had a good late night meal at grand lux cafe . good food there !
1	oh , i love noda brewing so much ! it is by far one of the best breweries in charlotte . we came here last night simply to drop off an empty keg . yes , keg ....... we like our beer ! ( the keg was a ramble on red . ) however , we ended up staying for one drink , which then turned to two drinks haha . both my husband and i had the gord-geous , which is their seasonal pumpkin beer . i believe there is only a few kegs left of it and then it will be tapped out for the year . they are replacing the gord-geous seasonal with a winter spiced beer . while sitting there drinking our beer , they announced that they were going to do a tour . they do tours during the week at 6pm . so , we decided to join in . the tour was very interesting and the tour guide was excellent . they are just venturing out into the world of canning beers and it was neat to see that in progress . we stayed for a second beer and watched an art exhibition/fundraiser that was going on in the tasting room . we both got the hop drop and roll , which is incredible ! i love this place because it has a chill atmosphere , there is always a food truck in the back , the beers are spot on , and parking in the back is plentiful ! they are doing some incredible things in the beer world there and i cant wait to watch them further expand and grow in the future .
0	located inside palms casino . did n't have a good experience . they advertisied a special but did not honor it when we got there .
0	the day crew in the casino is flat out rude . i especially want to call out the nasty floor lady who was working as a pit boss or floor . i find it amazing that with that terrible new yorker accent that she should be the last one to make derogatory comments about guests . i was observing her talking trash about the players to some of the dealers and then she goes up to them and asks them how they are doing . very backstabbing . i really did n't care until she decided to start in on me . i told her i did n't appreciate it and she said `` why are you listening in on my personal conversations ? '' i replied i was n't and suggested she reserve her comments for the break room . she gave a fake smile , went over to the computer and did something . probably screwed up my play rating . whatever . selling off my lvs stocks tonight .
1	reasonably priced strip hotel , decent casino . friends and i stayed on ( and subsequently laid waste to ) the eighth floor . our rooms were all recently renovated and much nicer than expected , thankfully nothing like the mgm . for what we paid , we got clean linens , soft beds , and good lighting . of course , there was an ipod dock by the nightstand . the mirage 's casino might be dark for some , but they 've got a pleasantly vegetated bar area near the front lobby . if you 're hungry , there 's a light selection of restaurants . table games have reasonable minimum limits , and not-so-reasonable limits are available for those who like the thrill of gambling . played multiple deck blackjack ( did n't know that existed ! ) and roulette , and lost , but all of my friends won . go figure ! service was good . called the front desk for various reasons , and friendly concierges got me details for a restaurant when i needed it . anyone know of the tram between the mirage and treasure island ? it 's so convenient ! not like it was an issue stumbling to a neighboring casino .
0	this place is the worst restaurant in vegas . services , food , and dinning area are failed . i was surprised that health dept shut it down so late in july 2014. my family was dinning there few times and the foods and services are getting worse and worse . i speak their language and hear they bad month their customers , who obviously dont understand chinese . services is the worst part , i have to go to their stations to get my tea cups after i asked for assistance about missing tea cups from our table . it took me few minutes to find 2 clean cups ! yes , they serve dim sum all day , big deal ! those dim sum will stay in the carts until they are sold . the heat in those carts are weak , go figure how fresh they are . be careful what they charge u on the check ! we found couple times they over charged us on what we did not order . we are going dim sum somewhere else nowadays . we will never return to this place unless it has a new owner . this will happen really soon . mark my word !
0	luckily , we had a gift certificate for dinner here ( it was in december 2011 , but never got around to writing a review ) . total for two of us was $ 88 , which included a couple of beers and a glass of wine . the riesling was amazing ! ! started out with the calamari appetizer , which was light , crispy , and yummy . dipping sauces complimented it quite well . for the main course , i had the salmon piccata , which was decent , but nothing amazing ( $ 18 ) . i 'm not a huge fan of prime rib , but my friend ordered it and said it was fantastic ( $ 28 ) . none of the main courses come with sides , so you order them family style . we got the mashed potatoes , which were also good . did n't get to see any of the entertainment , as we went prior to a hockey game . ambiance was fancy , but there were people in jeans to business attire . wo n't be going back for a few reasons ... a ) it 's closed ! b ) the pricing does n't warrant frequent visits and c ) it 's pretty far from home .
0	my previous review was for an oil change , which i still stand by . this time i brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise . i was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around $ 350 to replace the whole pipe . the pipe itself was not damaged and i asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car ( either by welding it or creating a new bracket ) . the mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers . i called around and was quoted $ 200 to replace the pipe at speedys muffler . when i brought it in there to get it replaced , they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for $ 45 . make sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that chet 's did n't consider .
1	this place is great . get a pizza for an appetizer ! it 's quality home made italian food at a fair price . i consider myself a regular here , although the world sees it differently
0	there is no cilantro ! have a salsa bar with not much salsa and no chips . prices are reasonable . chicken is dry and food is bland .
1	this hotel is freakin ' old , and it sort of shows , but i happen to love this casino and hotel in spite of it 's flaws . i stayed here with my sister a while ago . our room had two twin beds which were hard as rocks and the pillows sucked , but the price was amazing ! so , it 's all give and take . i still slept well and my wallet was happy . my sister was convinced the place was haunted , and she might be right considering the building 's age , but i did n't see anything out of the ordinary . the staff was super friendly and the casino was great ! it had lots of cheap games and the dealers were eager to help a new gambler like me , i am sure to take my money , but whatever . the snack bar here is the home of the famous .99 cent shrimp cocktail . i had heard about this thing on the travel channel and was excited to try it . you know what ? it was seriously good ! the shrimp was fresh and the cocktail sauce had the perfect amount of spice . .99 cents , who would have thought ? if you need a cheap bed in vegas or cheap good eats , check out he golden gate hotel ...
1	so you 've just had a long week of work , and you want to do nothing but relax . however , you end up going out anyways , because you know your friends wo n't let you live it down for staying in on a friday night . you might start the night off at chasers , finishing a pitcher ... or 4 , then head over to wando 's for some fishbowls . now at this point , all you want is to do some headbanging and dance your ass off . you decide to go to madison 's , and head immediately to the bar . you get a rum & coke , and fork over a few dollars for tip . despite being already tipsy at this point , you can still taste too much of the alcohol , which means that the past few dollars were definitely well spent . after downing the drink , you put your game face on and brave the dance floor . they play some top 40 stuff , and you 're thinking to yourself , i could make this work . then , out of nowhere , gangnam style starts playing , and before you know it , you 're making a complete fool out of yourself at the center of the dance floor . next thing you know , you wake up in your bed , thankfully entirely clothed . with nothing but facebook pictures to rely on , you start to piece together the night before . now if that does n't sound like an awesome night , then i do n't know what people do for fun these days .
0	rude unhelpful staff , difficult parking , actual rooms are across the street in another building ( which they do n't tell you , they just just let you wander the casino till you get in line again ) seriously ready to drive back to los angeles or maybe find a motel 6 ... it might be classier
1	i wish i could give 4.5 stars . the only thing holding back is atmosphere - this place is in a mall with smokey gambling pits nearby . that being said , the food was , although simple sandwich fare , pretty darn tasty for fast food . i ordered the original 1762 sandwich - roast beef , sharp cheddar & creamy horseradish . beef was very thinly sliced and seemed of quite nice quality and the artisan bread was good , with plenty of horseradish sauce that was just perfectly spicy .
0	3.5 ? i 'm a wimp - i want halfsies . my kids love this place . i think the ice cream is probably really good but it 's just too rich for me . most recently i got a kid 's cup of salted caramel . if you read my reviews i 'm a big fan of salted caramel . this was n't salted and not very caramelly but very rich . the kids get cotton candy with gummy bears and other stuff mixed in . the thing about this place ? they are very , very cool to the community always supporting schools . so i must take the kids as often as i can !
1	i ate here this past friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions . we decided to come here because it was pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $ 30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $ 12 . it ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of point breeze which i had been past many times previously but never really noticed . the restaurant was swamped whenever we got there , probably due to a combination of it being friday night and restaurant week , so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately . i decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque . my salad was good and came with goat cheese , pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely . it was nothing amazing but i think it takes a really special salad to be amazing . i also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since i do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it . for my entree i decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos . the tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors ( cilantro , aoili and pico ) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick . my mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good . there was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and i liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish . i was also able to try the arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered . wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too . immediately i regretted not ordering it although i still did enjoy my two small plates . for my dessert course i ended up having the white chocolate creme brulee . my girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry . all of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry ! my creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal . the bottom line for me is that i would definitely head back here in the future . their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that i had tried throughout the night was good .
0	okay , so its probably unfair for me to review cartel . i went there to pick up beans . it was pretty clear that the beans i was buying were n't roasted recently . ( they told me they were about to roast . ) but , i was desperate . in all fairness , the beans smelled awesome . yet , the taste did n't get close to the smell -- -not delicate at all -- -much more grocery store like . i will go back and try when their beans are fresh . atmosphere looked great . i was more than slightly ( ehmmm ) insulted when they suggested that i was dropping off my kid for college . last i checked , i was n't nearly of that age group .
1	firefly had a pretty diverse menu , with some traditional favorites and some more trendy picks . five dishes was about the right number for the two of us , who were hungry but not starving . we each had a glass of wine and an after dinner digestif , and ended up at about $ 80 . the atmosphere is casual , and portions are ample . mussels : very tasty in a coconut curry broth , served with bread to soak up the goodness tuna peppers : probably the lowlight . we 're big fans of peppadews , but they were pretty much just stuffed with canned tuna , drizzled with oil , and plated . disappointing . lamb chops : cooked perfectly , interesting side with lentils and veggies stuffed dates : yum ! everything they should be . pulpo asado : very tender octopus , pretty flavorful we ordered the sliders , and they showed up on the bill , but never came out . we were already getting full by the time we noticed , and the server was apologetic and gracious about taking it off the bill .
0	3 strikes and you are out ! being in the medical field i am always disappointed when i find a company whose bottom line is all about the money . this is by far one of the most disorganized places i have ever dealt with . they could care less if your animal has to have a chronic medication for the treatment of cancer , much less a steroid which is never just supposed to be stopped , always tapered down . i gave this place 3 tries -- each time they got it wrong . this last time i received no call , had to call them and then was told it would be 5 working days before i would get it which means next week ..... and i live in phoenix . if i wanted to go pick it up -- expedited that would be another $ 18.95 .. why should i have to pay them for their error . so obviously customer service is also not their strong suite either . i will never use this pharmacy again and i will be sure i let everyone i know who has animals to do the same .
0	i come here quite often to pick up bagels for weekend breakfast . the servers are often less than friendly but that 's not my biggest complaint about this place . there has to be a way to change the layout so that you do n't get bowled over by the stroller brigade while trying to get your coffee . the space next to the coffee machines is used as the main walkway and with tables pushed all the way to the back there is very little space next to the coffee dispensers . if the line gets backed up , between that and all the entitled mamas who think any space should accommodate their hulking strollers and baby carriers it 's nearly impossible to fill your coffee without bumping into anyone .
0	i brought my pug to see dr. plummer in april 2014 after receiving a referral from my regular vet . please note that i am not leaving this negative review because of the pricing - i would n't expect a neurological veterinarian to be cheap . i also can not say that the office staff was unfriendly - in fact they were wonderful . my negative review is simply due to dr. plummer and the service my pug received from him . kaluha ( my pug ) had lost feeling in her back legs , she was still able to walk but her reactions were just very slow & it was getting worse as time passed . she was also beginning to have difficulty feeling when she had to poop . when i bought her in to see dr. plummer he had started by first ruling out degenerative myelopathy which i appreciated because i 'd hate to think i paid $ 3,000 for an mri when a $ 300 test could 've proven it was this disease all along . however , that test came back negative so the only other option was go through with the mri . it 's fair to say that i would n't pay this much money for an mri unless i was also ready to pursue surgery resulting in another $ 3,000 . however , in making the decision to continue with surgery i wanted to be sure that this would help her gain function in her back legs . dr. plummer could not guarantee that she would regain function but she would n't get any worse & that was a key point in my decision making . maybe this surgery would n't bring my kaluha back to the way she was but i knew she would n't lose complete function so i went through with the surgery . kaluha was given steroids after her surgery and i certainly did n't expect a quick turnaround but after 1 month and seeing her still struggling i called & asked dr. plummer why we were n't seeing any improvement . he put her back on the steroids but this still did n't help at which point i was starting to believe she would be that `` unlikely possibility of never regaining function '' . this was upsetting for me but the purpose of the surgery was that kaluha would not get worse . well kaluha has gotten progressively worse since her surgery in april . now she ca n't even feel when she has to urinate ! worse yet , she ca n't hold herself up when she has to urinate so i have to hope that i am near & can hold her up so she does n't get stuck in it . i brought her back in to show dr. plummer that she has gotten worse & he could n't figure out why this would happen . in fact he told me that it is now time to consider getting her a doggy wheel chair because of her deteriorating condition . he had absolutely no intention on trying to determine what went wrong after i paid $ 6,000 for a surgery not for a guarantee that she 'd get better but for the peace of mind in knowing she would n't get worse . he told me i could pay for another mri to see what 's going on ... another mri ? ! oh but he was kind enough to offer a 50 % discount on this second mri ! now i guess the only thing i can do for kaluha is to watch for when i start to see her have signs of pain so that i know it 's time to put her down . the only thing i received from going through all of this is knowing that i tried everything i could for kaluha even though dr. plummer gave up after he collected his fee .
1	the end of february was my first time visiting vegas with my sisters and we figured we might as well check all the sights off our bucket lists . one of my oldest sisters has been very sick and we knew that this would sadly be the last trip we could all take together . we took a lot of pictures in the attraction and also participated in the two professional photo opportunities . i did n't plan on purchasing any of those photos but a young lady whose name was either jennifer or jessica convinced me otherwise . i 'm so happy i did because my sister passed a couple of days ago and now i have those pictures to last me a life time . you can put a wax attraction any where , but this location in particular had some of the kindest employees i 've encountered . five stars for me .
1	being a vegetarian , brunches can be pretty monotonous . visiting eleven for brunch last week was such a welcome relief . i opted for the pre fix menu and the dishes were just awesome . the gnocchi was rich and flavorful . i called for ruby red and the cocktail was a-mazing ! the ambience is classy and its a great way to spend your weekend morning . i called for the cheese appetizer and they had a great variety . would certainly go back !
0	when we hired a painter to paint the main area of our house this was the place he sent us to buy the paint . i think some of the other reviewers implied that because their painter used dunn-edwards paint that means it must be really high quality . in reality it is because they cater to professional painters and contractors and offer loyalty and volume discounts . anyway , now we are stuck going there repeatedly so that we can get the same paint for touch ups or other areas that need to match . i do n't think their paint is superior to benjamin moore or sherwin williams . and the service at the store is not good . i have been in there multiple times and had to wait a good long while for someone to help me only to find that they could n't answer any of my questions anyway . and their painting supplies ( brushes , rollers , etc ) are very overpriced . for your basic project just stick to ace hardware or lowe 's .
1	7/07 update : i had a 4 hour wait due to dropping my rental car off early , so had time to blow . i was flying united , terminal 2 and there is nothing there , so was told by a tsa staff member to hang out at terminal 4 , more eateries and shopping and there definately was , swa and us hub . definately spent my time here leisurely waiting for my flight and jumped on the shuttle to get be back to terminal 2 for my united flight . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i enjoy this airport , i do n't mind the tram , you take one of two to get to baggage or parking . pretty simple . and going to the new car rental place is easy . the shuttle ride is around 10-15 minutes . enterprise car rental treated me really well . very customer service .
0	i only go here when i 'm in the area because it 's the only brunch place that does n't have a line up on a saturday morning ... maybe it 's a sign ? the service is horrible and extremely slow . it usually takes 20 minutes go get a cup of coffee . the potatoes are tasteless , the eggs benedict are super runny , the coffee tastes like dirty water ... and the list goes on and on . i 've given this place a chance , twice , and it just gets worse . if you 're able to get in and out of this place with the right order and under 3 hours , it 's a miracle .
0	if you like real down home bbq , good ole southern flare then this is not the place for you . i got so mad thinking i hit the jackpot in good ole country boy bbq the brisket was tough the ribs were fatty the sauce taste like bbq/spaghetti sauce . if you go here and never ever ever had good real bbq then you might just like it ... if you are above the mason dixon line ... then you might like it ....
1	great service and extremely friendly waitress . i came here with my wife during lunch hours and we both were equally impressed with the quality of the food and cleanliness of the buffet . the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were my 2 favorites and i could n't help but go back up and dig in for more . the american comfort food section gets 4 stars in my opinion , would give it 5 but its missing all of the veggies ... no green beans , corn , broccoli etc ... pretty odd to skip out on that but my wife was more bummed out than myself .... i was cool with eating meats and potatoes . i did n't attempt the asian stuff and the pizza bar was sub-par it all look dried out and whats up with fruit on top of pizza ? maybe its just not my style . the dessert section was above average . the fresh baked donuts , caramel apple cupcake and parfait ( wife 's fav ) were all very tasty and worth mentioning . lastly the cotton candy was a pretty cool a tasty gimmick ; )
0	overpriced and not worth it ... boooo .
1	this review will be similar to a scolding i might give my kid when he comes home with 5 a 's and 1 b. i know you are doing great , but you can improve ! ! ! : ) i can see where all the love comes from . the food sold here tastes `` fresh and home-made '' for sure . but not too much i have had here ( and i have eaten there 4 times now ) has really made me say , `` wow , this is some of the best food around . '' the salsas and guacamole are very good . the carne asada does have a very nice taste - however , it 's shown a tendency to be a little bit ( just the tiny , tiniest bit ) dry on occasion . the chips ( served room temperature and costing $ 1.50 ) are store-bought and not up to par with the rest of the food . the charro beans are definitely among the top contenders in the valley . i 'd up this to a 5-star if they 'd fry their own chips , or change to a style they can serve warm , and maybe leave some of the juice in the carne asada . a nice place to eat . a smidge away from about as fresh as food can taste .
0	let 's start with the good things ! i enjoyed my burger . i got `` the brgr '' ( 8 oz . handcrafted dry-aged prime beef , pickled red onions , arugula , creamy blue cheese , oven-roasted tomatoes ) , and got to add a healthy piece of seared foie gras . ( aside : fois gras is not so easy to find in ca anymore ... ) . our little party also got both the herbed fries and cajun tater tots . both were delicious , and getting the truffled cheez whiz was a good idea . my alcoholic milkshake was also a win . so , after that , why only two stars ? the service was horrendous . it 's like everyone who works here does n't want to be there . they chat with themselves , they disappear for a while . if you 're going to be in some sort of service position , you should look like you give a shit about the people you serve . service was terribly spotty . the nicest , most polite person there was the busser - we asked him if he could send our server over ( because we had basically been ignored for a while ) , and when i saw the exchange , it 's like i could feel the eye-roll off his body language . and it still took a few moments longer than it should have to come over ( of course , he had to finish that conversation with the other server ) . it 's really unfortunate that , despite the good food , i 'm really dissuaded from ever wanting to come back . the people that work here just suck that bad . although , i would highly recommend that that busser go work somewhere that he 'd get more in tips - i 'm sure the lackluster service that the servers provide really affect his bottom line .
0	the phx zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large , charismatic megafauna . however , if you are like me , you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display . there is very little of this , the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe , if you are lucky , the country where the animal lives . the zoo is also mammal heavy . do n't get me wrong , i love a good mammal display , but i also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles . if that is what you like to see , the phx zoo is not the place for you . they do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians , but that is it for the herps ... they also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall , they lack the fish , amphibians , and reptiles . also , where is the insect collections ? maybe i missed it . the animals do have very large enclosures , but some look under kept . also , there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species . they have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now ... a shame ... overall , i was pretty disappointed in the phx zoo , the admission was pricey , and the breadth of animals small .
1	this is one of my all time favorite buffets in all of las vegas . i have been to some of the other buffets in vegas such as aladdin , bally 's , circus circus , excalibur , the rio , stratosphere . but nothing is like the le village buffet of paris las vegas ! ! !
1	arai pastry is so delicious ! ironically i come here not for the sweeties : confections , cakes , cookies , cremes , not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats ! the breads they make here are top knotch , the various salty pastries are all worth exploring , the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites . but the real deal , the coup de gr\u00e2ce , the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop ( in my mind ) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes yes yes i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy
1	i had the blacked ahi watermelon salad it came with sweet soy & wasabi-marinated tuna , almonds , tamarind vinaigrette ! i 'm not a big fish person but this was really good . our witness with real nice and the chef came out and checked on us !
1	i came across pizz\u00e9d\u00e9lic pizza and pastas on notre-dame west and it looked like fun . it 's funkadelic inside ! i ordered a belle gueule pilsner ... it was delish ! i had a small works pizza ( pepperoni , mushrooms , green peppers and mozzarella ) minus the mushrooms . it was tasty . i 've never had a square pizza before . my server , martini , was great ... she obviously enjoys her job . the next time i 'm in montr\u00e9al and i 'm craving pizza , i 'll be back !
1	went here on the first night of a week-long sales conference with part of my new extended team . someone in the original group could n't go so they asked me and i jumped at the chance . i 've only seen a handful of shows in vegas so i was excited to see this one . it shows at ti ( treasure island ) which gives you a sense of its place in the hierarchy of cirque shows . it 's better than the traveling kooza in most ways , but not as good as o. the show is pretty funny . yes there are definitely parts where it is breathtaking and spectacular , but what strikes me the most are the funny parts . it 's not even just a 30-second way to transition between scenes . there are full-on 5-7 minute skits where it 's that big baby or the crazy emcee . funny yes , but they completely break up the flow of a show without a lot of flow to begin with . where le reve was simply visually stunning at times , mystere has some really trippy parts where i just have to sit back and shake my head a few times . nothing lewd or incendiary , but it 's somewhat surreal to be watching . as for the acts , some where astonishing , but i actually feel like kooza ( even in the smaller stage and area in the at & t park parking lot in sf had more astounding physical acts . we sat slightly off center stage and about 6 rows back , so we had a very good view of the stage and everything around us . there is more crowd interaction than a lot of shows , particularly le reve and kooza . they brought at least 2 people on stage and interacted directly with about 8 people in the audience . very good show . unless you 're a hardcore o fan , you will definitely enjoy this .
0	i really wanted to love this place . i 've heard great things about fuego bistro and always wanted to try both restaurants . this was the biggest disappointment i have had at a restaurant in a long time . the service was horrible . the hostess was more interested in chatting with the bartender than seating us . once the hostess finally acknowledged us and came to seat us she informed us that they were closing in 30 minutes and we needed to order right away . this was at 8:20pm on a saturday night ! she turned away another party later at 8:50pm by saying the kitchen was closed for the evening . as of writing this the website still says they are open til 10pm . if i were the owner or manager i would have fired this hostess/waitress on the spot . as this was our first time here we wanted to try several different tacos . we ordered short rib , carne asada , and shrimp tacos . the shrimp used were small tasteless . the short rib tacos were awkwardly sweet . i 'm not sure they always taste like that or if it was just a bad batch . i would definitely not order them again . the carne asada was good . the rice was obviously the last of the pot . it was dry and crusty like it had been stuck on the bottom of the pot all day . i would have been even more disappointed if i had paid full price . we used a restaurant.com certificate . regardless , it was not worth the visit .
0	had the baked ziti & it was orange & gross . the staff not very attentive , more into work & customer avoidance .
1	omg this place is amazing and definitely worth the long wait ! ! ! ! ! if you 're drunk and with your friends waiting , time will fly by fast . the way the place is laid out is in the casino area of palace station , literally looks like a little bar area , and seats no more than 15-20 people , tops . my friend , bf and i waited like an hour . ladies , make sure you switch your heels from the club/dayclub with some comfy flip flops or flats ! ! ! ! you will thank me later . i have this tendency where i order too much food when i 'm drunk , but with waiting for an hour , who cares ? ! ! ! so now onto the food ! ! ! ! oyster shooters : mmm yummy . super refreshing and oysters were fresh to death . highly recommend . combo pan roast : my friend and i got one each ... and it was sooooo goood . it came with shrimp , lobster and crab and the texture of the orange stewy sauce was soooo succulent and eating it with the scoop of rice they give you on top is just simply amazing . bouillabaisse : my boyfriend got this , and it had noodles in it and was a little more soupy but still had some stewy texture . he says it 's highly comparable to bouillabaisse in the east coast and oyster bar is the best place for it on the westside . alaskan clam chowder : omg this chowder is so good . probably the best clam chowder i 've ever had in my life . it comes with shrimp , crab , lobster , and of course , clams , and the chowder is so rich in flavor and the perfect amount of saltiness . get it manhattan style or new england style . be ready to pass out for about an hour or two before you rage some more ... this place hits the spot and is definitely amazing comfort food . even the next morning we reheated all of the leftovers in our hotel and it still tasted so amazing . i urge you to make time for this place if you 're a seafood and stew lover if you 're ever in vegas . hope this helped ! ; )
0	no bell boy to help me while i waa struggling with a bunch of things . no one offered help . no front desk service for 5 mins when i arrived . hall ways smell like public toilets . shitty . def not a 4 star hotel .
0	this is my first 1 star review it used to be that i could place an internet order and instantly know that it would be correctly done to my specifications in the time that i requested it in . recently : i do n't know who the buffoon 's are that the now `` fedex kinko 's '' hired , but the last three orders i put in not only sucked , it took decades for these people to find and although i left my phone number in bold for them to call if there were any questions , they sent me three emails instead of calling me . whooo i ask you sits at their inbox waiting for a response from kinkos ? these people are idiots . i will be going to the washington one from now on .
1	so it 's saturday night and we decide we ca n't party too hard because we have 11:00 am reservations for the sterling brunch however 1 sake leads to 5 , then that leads to vodka shots and we end up calling it a night at 5 in the morning ... bad idea lol i really wish i was n't so hungover so i could have enjoyed it to the fullest but none the less the buffet was still delicious ! we started with the seafood which was what really drew us here .. the oysters were fresh , the shrimp were plump , the crab claws were good and easy to open ! the smoked salmon was delicious .. however the lobster was a tad overcooked but nothing a little budda budda could n't solve .. i wish they sliced open the king crab legs for you since they are so hard to crack open .. some pieces were a little on the salty side but still good . i liked adding big chunks of lobster into the lobster bisque .. and if you go to the mini sushi bar ask the chef for some caviar , my dining partner , fellow yelper ( chingoo l ) really enjoyed the caviar even though it was quite fishy .. well what else would you expect from fish eggs ... ? haha the stand out dish for me was the lamb ... omg it was delicious ! ! ! not gamey at all and it had a little sweet crust to it ! soooo soooo good ! ! ! ! i feel like the dessert section was not that impressive .. it looked better in the pictures ... when we were standing in line for creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e the chef made it fresh for the man in front of us and when we got to the front she just pointed at one that had been chilling there ... & there 's nothing worse than creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that has a soft top ... hmph as for service our server was very nice sometimes it took a little too long for our drinks to get to the table but he constantly kept our champagne flutes filled to brim ; ) ) ) i think the best part of this brunch was the drinks ! they have a bloody mary bar up front that is made with either grey goose or belvedere ... the champagne is perrier jou\u00ebt from france , the orange juice is freshly squeezed with a nice pulp , their expresso is strong , they have zipang sake shots at the sushi bar and they even serve `` artesian water '' in cool bottles haha and all these drinks are included with your meal ... too bad i was so hungover though ... by the end of the meal i had 6 glasses of different beverages on our table ... lol i do n't think i could ever pay the full price of $ 90/person .. and i guess they do n't do local 's discounts anymore .. so i 'm so happy we got a groupon deal for $ 98 for two people ~ ! ! ! i would probably get that deal again if it ever came up .. special shoutout to fellow yelper joseph p. ... thanks for treating us to the best brunch we 've ever had~ ! ps : i liked how all the servers say `` madame ... '' haha
1	this is the second time i visited cut and both times have been very good experiences - once in the restaurant and once just at the bar for some appetizers . the food is as you would expect , inventive and adventurous . not everyday you get to try steak of this quality . it is missing the fifth star because the food , while very good , it is n't the best in vegas . also , the service is very , very vegas - snooty without class , make you wait in line outside the club even though their is no one inside kind of crap . not everyone there is like that , but enough of them are ( especially at the hostess stand ) to make it annoying .
1	i was super sad when green mango closed , so i 'm glad thai cottage opened back up so quickly in its place . i was even more pleased when i saw pad ped on the menu , my absolute favorite thai dish which i have not been able to find at any other thai restaurant in pittsburgh . i ordered this , spiciness of 6 , with chicken . the portion was a good size with plenty of meat . i 'm a big lover of spice , but their level 6 was extremely spicy , even for me , so i 'll probably tone it down to a 4 next time . but other than that i was very happy with the dish . all the veggies seemed fresh and crisp , the flavors were great . my friend said her pad thai was perfect as well . the servers , although a little quiet and shy , were attentive and prompt . my only lament is that thai cottage , unlike green mango , does not have bubble tea . please get bubble tea ! so to conclude , i 'm happy that thai cottage is now there , and i see myself being a regularly customer here very soon !
1	look down into the basin or you 'll miss it ! thank goodness my hubby looked over the mounds of gravel to look down into the basin to find this gem of a dog park within walking distance from our home . the dog park is not only full of healthy grass and each section is huge . by the time our dog ran to the edge of the fence he was a tiny dot in the distance . what i really like about this place is that they built the benches down the center of the dog park for us humans . i like this because a lot of the other dog parks that i 've gone to have seating on one edge of the park and if your dog runs to the other side and makes a # 2 you 'd never be able to see him unless you followed him around the park , ... thereby increasing your chances in stepping on said 'poo ' . so happy we found this place and we will most definitely be regulars here !
0	ca n't really say it better than jason c. our visit here was okay . but i could n't get over the bad lay-out and the waste of outdoor space . seating was uncomfortable and the place was hot ( in march ) because no windows were open . the service was good ( maybe over-attentive ) , but the overal experience was n't one i 'll soon seek out again .
1	rallys dude drove here drunk last sunday . me and burd ordered some blt 's and i said `` gimmie ur largest order of onion rings my man ! '' we were sitting there chowin down when all of a sudden a brawl broke out . luckily they were throwin broomsticls chairs and razor wire ( only at each other dude ) i had my mace can but fired it backwards out accident as i tried firing indiscriminately . shot it in my bug glasses sorry dude .
1	ordered delivery . food was hot and fresh . orange chicken was great . combination fried rice was awesome , big shrimp in it . only downfall was i got not sweet and sour sauce for my wontons . but food is excellent
0	good burger , but too pricey for what you get . when i come to vegas i like to go to as many restaurants as i can and just order a item on the menu and split it . the bf and i got the blt burger and it was delish , but too pricey . i would have rather spent the $ 15+ for a full meal at grand lux lol . nothing special so this review is short . note : our waiter was nice , fast and attentive , but the hostesses need a personality check . they were rude and not too friendly ... i did n't even want to enter the joint , but the bf wanted to try the burgers ... if i came back and saw them i would walk the other way
0	wow , extremely overpriced and rude . i understand you do n't want kids in your establishment but you are right next to a children 's museum . we went there starving and left mildly hungry after dropping $ 50 on ok pizza . i have definitely had better at a lower price but the main reason i am even reviewing this place is how rude the wait staff was .
0	regardless of where i was in vegas , there was always that questionable orange hooters tempo smacking me upside the cornea . i look out my hotel window , my view ? the hulking hooters casino . walking down the strip , minding my own business , trucks with huge hooters billboards beckon at every stop , not to mention 3/5 taxis have some form of hooters advertising on them . so after 4 days of constant bombardment , before heading off to the airport on day last , i decided to give hooters a try . it was dining misadventure.\r \r i was seated at the bar near a group of 4 guys that came in 1 minute before me . 30 minutes later , they had almost finished their wings and i still did n't have my food . the bargirl who took my order re-assured me a couple of time that my wings+fries would be out soon . rrrrright . honestly she was more interested in checking her cell for text messages and slacking off than getting me my food . shortly thereafter , i just walked out , hungry & disgruntled . wiggity wack ( tm ) ! ! ! \r \r hypoglycemia never makes for a happy review or reviewer . 1 star for all flash and no flava in my tummy !
0	an honest 3 1/2 stars . i really wanted to like big ern 's bbq more . it 's good , but only comes out to average for me when compared to other bbq . and we all are biased when it comes to bbq because we all have different tastes . some love smoke , some love spice , some love sauce , some love tomato-based , some love mustard-based , and some love vinegar-based . hell , some folks even love boiled ribs ! just as a note people , boiled meats are not bbq . this was our meal when we visited downtown container park . it looked interesting because when we where there , this place had the longest line . figure the food must be the best around , right ? well , yes and no . it is arguably one of the best places to eat within the park . but for bbq it 's not my favorite . but still good for what it is . we had the two item combo platter of pulled pork and hot link . the platter came with a roll , and two sides . most popular items leaving the kitchen that day were the mac & cheese , and the baked beans . we ended up trying those . we also picked up an extra hot link sandwich to try . verdict ? as i said before , good but not great . the pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and was light on flavor , but good on smoke . the sides were ok - the mac & cheese was yummy but needed a bit more cheese . the baked beans were decent , not overly sweet and i think there may have been bits of pork in it . the star of the show was the hot link . these i liked very much ! spicy , good flavor , and good texture . they had a great chew when you bit in to one , nice snap . delicious on the hot link sandwich . their bbq sauce is n't bad either , tomato-based , it appeals to those who like a sweeter sauce . slather this all over your hot link sandwich and it was good eats . reason why it 's down a 1/2 star is the darn pricing . whoa , i get it , everything in downtown container park is pricey ! i mean for $ 12 on a two item combo platter i was expecting a bit more food . it 's good for one person , a bit difficult for two to share . the sandwiches are $ 7 each but do n't come with a side . it will cost you $ 2 more to add that on . adding on a soft drink will tack on another $ 2 . do n't go to big ern 's bbq expecting a cheap meal ! but then again do n't go to downtown container park and expect anything on the cheap .
0	where do i even begin . the restroom was disgusting smelled like urine , out of toilet paper and paper towels . extremely slow and half ass pedicure . when i asked for paraffin i was told no it takes 2 hours to heat up ( you would think they would handle that when opening the salon in the morning ) and offered salt scrub instead , which i declined since it gives my sensitive skin a razor burn effect . not kid friendly . my 6 year old likes to get her toes done with mommy , and was yelled at for trying to turn on the massage chair `` that not a toy ! ! '' and after my toes were done i was moved to an uncomfortable chair to sit with a tiny little fan blowing cold air on my feet for 30 minutes ! ! i could go on but this pretty much covers the basics . i am normally a 20 % tipper and for the first time i left no tip . we will most definitely not be back . as inexpensive as this place is i left feeling over charged and unsatisfied . i could have soaked my feet in cool water rubbed lotion on them and painted my toes at home for free and not felt unwelcome .
0	cuisine in\u00e9gale , rapport qualit\u00e9 prix m\u00e9diocre .
1	knowing that this is a bobby flay establishment , i had high expectations . and they were met . the service was elite , the food was fresh , unique and extremely tasty . the shrimp tamale appetizer was phenomenal as was the mushroom quesadilla . the reason i did not rate it with 5 stars was that my salmon was a undercooked and the coconut cake tasted like it came out of a box . otherwise , it was a wonderful experience .
1	i find myself bent in strange positions - v__o o '' '' '' /\\ and `` rubbed '' by a chubby ethnic man . yet i somehow loved it all the same . it was heaven for about 2 hours . i was zonked and tired and wanted to faint even the pokemon-center could n't wake me up
0	meeehhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! very average at best , much betta options out there .
0	i attended a company holiday party in their ballroom . the ballroom was beautiful and so was their pool area , where they had set up some heaters . however , their catering was not my favorite . they served us thanksgiving style food -- turkey , potatoes , butter glazed carrots , spring mix salad , stuffing , rolls , yams , etc . they also provided a dessert bar that included a blackberry pie and apple pie and some small bites . everything was `` nice , '' i just was n't wowed by anything and food is very important to me ! if i ever had to host a personal event , i would probably not choose this place if i had to use the same catering .
0	wow you get what you pay for ... so the manager site my wife and i in the corner where they did n't have a server to take are drinks or clean off the table when we got a second plate . then the rice was heard , and the chicken was dry , ok they got ta have something ! so i compromised and went for the mongolian . bingo it was good or maybe it was just because my taste buds had already been let down that i wanted it to taste good . what im saying is you get what you pay for , if you only have a few bucks and do n't want micky dees , then the buffet at the fiesta henderson is the place for you ...
0	i took my 3 year old here for a haircut and he walked out with the worst one ever . i understand he is a kid , but he always sits still for his cuts . the stylist looked as if she was not comfortable cutting his hair and completely rushed through it . we were out of there in 10 minutes ! to top it all off , she cut his ear with the clippers and did n't even bother to wipe the blood off . when i made my appointment , i made sure to tell the receptionist that i was bringing in my 3 year old . not sure why they gave us someone who clearly is n't good with cutting a child 's hair . we will definitely not be going back .
0	this place came as a huge surprise . i went with a group of friends and we had heard that this place was great . i thought it was the exact opposite . the waiters , instead of taking our order , kept serving us water which almost made us late for the show we were seeing afterwards . it was also very expensive . for a cheap salad and a mediocre chicken parmesan it was around $ 30 . i could n't believe it . this placed seemed like it would have some real italian food for a good price but i could not have been more wrong . i finished my food in less than 5 minutes that 's how small of a portion their entrees are . i can say that this was a very dissatisfying venture and i wish i could 've gotten my money back .
0	good food and fast service . seemed very clean and the staff was friendly . it did n't knock my socks off but was tasty still and great for a road trip meal .
0	new restaurant with a few bugs to work out . our server was new and not completely at ease with the menu , the pricing , the specials . food was good , but experience left something to be desired . glad hp is in the hood , but fix it quickly .
1	we have no shortage of mexican food joints in the phoenix area . some would say we maybe have too many . however , as an avid mexican food fan , i ca n't ever have enough . i will say , though , that some tend to be the same old story , with slight tweaks . example ? the burrito at garcia 's tastes a lot like the one at manuel 's . do n't even get me started on macayo 's ... however , fuego bistro is that breath of fresh air that we mexican food lovers have been waiting for . everything is fresh , unique , and absolutely fantastic . the first time i came here , i tried the pernil asada , a tender , shredded pork dish that beats any carnitas-style dish i 've ever had . the crisp , sweet red cabbage that they serve with it and other dishes is so amazing that even i eat it , and i typically hate cabbage . then there 's the happy hour . cheap prices on wonderful food , to include the cubano sliders . oh my goodness , were these something to die for . they go quite well with a cold modelo with lime too , by the way . prices run a bit high , but the lunch menu offers a bit of a break , and happy hour of course is very reasonable . in all , you wo n't be disappointed here . if anything , you 'll be thankful for a fresh take on a cuisine that has become rather saturated into the phoenix area . my kudos to the chef , staff , and owner of this fine dining establishment .
0	ok , so here is where yelp might have saved me , if i had seen this before i stayed here . but unfortunately i got the room through a bargain internet site , and did n't know the hotel i was reserving in . ate in the buffet and was happy with the choices ( there were veg options here , and that is not always the case in vegas ) . had breakfast at the tea house , and i do n't remember anything too bad about that . but then it is tough to screw up breakfast . i agree , the best reason to stay here is location and the cars . but would i ever go back , no , no , no .
0	i took my daughter there for her birthday party and the nail technician rushed through her nails and never put a top coat on them . all the nails clipped within less then 24 hours . i 'm not impressed and it 's like pulling teeth to get the job done correctly . it 's taking extra time out of my busy life to get them repainted correctly within their time frame . this was at the southpark location .
1	old school vegas steakhouse . the waiter , ca n't remember his name but i think it was rick , was fantastic . knowledgeable and good servicing . came with 2 friends on tuesday night at 5:30. drinks specials before 6pm ! first course was house salad with honey mustard . the dressing was a little heavily poured but good nonetheless . for dinner , i ordered the petite filet ( medium ) with garlic mashed potatoes and chef 's choice of vegetable ( carrots ) .... paired with house cab . meat was cooked perfectly along with the carrots . the garlic potatoes were excellent . dessert was sampler of creme brulee , basically 4 small squares : plain , strawberry , raspberry and chocolate . if you are into steak , this place is worth a stop . would go again .
1	this is not a bad place to have dinner . the atmosphere is casual and the service is just wonderful . i had the carpaccio and squash ravioli and they were amazing . price is a little higher than friday 's but trust me , you would want to come here instead .
1	cute restaurant . the hummus is really flavorful and delicious , and the bread is super soft and nice . the pita chips are so good but i know they must be awful for you . the grilled eggplant is really good - nice and light and fairly healthy . prices are reasonable . i 'd go back .
0	remember when this was sunflower market and it was awesome and rarely were things out of stock and carried just about everything i needed ? seems those days are over . in the last 3 weeks sprouts has been out of at least one thing on every trip i have made there . last week in one trip from my shopping list they were out of cinnamon sticks , bulk unbleached white flour , super dark roast bulk coffee , tofutti sour cream , and they no longer carry sriracha . when i brought this to the attention of the store manager ( who does n't seem to be the sharpest crayola in the box ) he seemed really apathetic . yep , seems sprouts has ruined what use to be a good thing .
1	favorite breakfast in the valley . i am a sucker for the french culture . i do n't care for crepes and croissants , but i am a sucker for a great cappuccino and eggs . and when there is a toasted french baguette option , i 'm all in . this place is a hidden gem and would n't have found it if i was n't waiting at the stereo system place across the way . fast , friendly , tasty . bonjour !
0	denny 's are all the same .. same ol menu .. same ol nasty greasy food ... but will definitely settle your cravings after a long night of severe drinking in vegas . this is located conveniently on the strip right next to harrahs . we had 6 of us and we ordered fairly simple things .. yet our waiter got a lot of things mixed up and messed up . its okay though he was awesome and put up with our complaints and such .. even gave us to go cups for our sodas .. extra side of hash browns , pancakes and toast . at least we left satisfied ..
0	very bad pizza ! take-out deep dish `` chicago-style '' pizza : crust not authentic , not buttery , crunchy and delicious like chicago 's pizza uno . toppings not fresh but from a can , yuck ! too much bland mozzarella cheese rather than creamy blend . sauce was bitter , also canned rather than homemade , it should have been sweet and fragrant like uno 's . a small pie with 4 toppings cost us $ 20 . uno left las vegas a few years ago , we will keep searching for authentic chicago deep dish pie .
1	the food at alexi 's is good . lunch time chicken pitas were my favorite , and at night for the occasional dinner i 'd get one of the fish entrees . the atmosphere is a bit odd , but the servers are good natured and quick . the only reservation i 'd have is the odd treatment i sometimes got by the host ( ess ) when i did not have a reservation . i was a regular at this place for a long time . occasionally though i 'd forget to call ahead to reserve a table . even if the place was completely empty , without a reservation the host ( ess ) many times will become visibly annoyed and act as if it is a big deal to find you a table and then put you in a corner somewhere . i do n't know if everyone feels that way , or if it was only a way to try to condition me to call ahead next time since they knew my face . overall however , other than that , it is a decent place to go for the occasional grub .
0	watch out . the driver did not allow me to carry a small bag in the bus because it had rollers . the bag was really small ( like a kid 's school bag ) but had telescoping handle with rollers . he cited some federal regulation ( i tried searching for the regulation online without any success ) . he wanted me to buy a passenger ticket for that ( $ 54 dollar was the last-minute price for pittsburgh to dc ) . anyway , i emptied out the content into a large macy 's shopping bag and off i went . believe me , i have taken larger ( airplane cabin type ) luggage with rollers /handle on greyhound bus several times in the past and it was never an issue .
1	i figure i 'd add to this review too , my sister ( michelle r. here on yelp ) already wrote a great review and i just wanted to say that i agree with her that this place is really authentic ! i come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials . if not the special , yes , the katsudon is delicious ( served w/ rice and onions and an egg on top ! ) . so are their bento boxes , i 'll usually order their grilled mackerel . and yes , their sushi is also really good . my only complaint would be that it 's a little small and it can get too crowded and busy , when that happens i 'll go to the other japanese restaurant right around the corner ...
1	we just heard about this detroit-style restaurant , so we drove from n. scottsdale to try it out . we are glad we did . we had the coney 's and the burger . both were delicious ! they use the chili made in detroit and even stay true to the experience and serve faygo pop and better made chips ! it has to be expensive to ship these products here , but it is key to making this place authentic , nostalgic and true to the food ! this one should be on your list of places to eat !
0	went to montreal for a weekend with friends , as i am sure many others did as well ! came here because a friend suggested it and it was the worst experience i have ever had at any establishment ever . mandatory tipping , overpriced drinks , shoved out the door because we were there for too long . horrible waitress . gave her an 8 $ tip on a $ 40 tab ( which was 4 beers ) and she complained and took $ 10 instead . she took money from us . save yourself the time and do n't stop in here . spend your money elsewhere .
0	attended to hear live music . second visit . as a place that aspires to southern cooking , especially bbq , lucille 's falls far short . beef brisket was tough ; bbq chicken was ok ; sides not so much . and how can you pose as a southern restaurant and not serve cornbread ? or hushpuppies ? good draft beer selection . service at the bar was friendly and quick . live music was good , not outstanding . if you 're a fan of good bbq , then there are much better choices in phoenix . avoid lucille 's if you 've ever had the opportunity to eat good southern bbq . this most definitely is n't it .
1	am from ny , but every time i am in the area , my girlfriend and i make it a point to stop at the mad greek and visit chris and his friendly crew , especially for a good home cookin ' breakfast . granted the place is a little rough around the edges , but i always enjoy the marinated chicken and/or ribeye with eggs . they have solid home fries as well . this may sound basic , but the piece de resistance of the mad greek is the fresh squeezed orange juice that they crank out , it 's fantastic ! best oj this side of south florida , stuff is like orange flavored crack in a glass ! and , if you like greek football ( aka soccer ) , it 's on 24/7 - was there during the world cup last year and had a blast watching it with the staff while enjoying my meal , good people .
0	i paid for the premium car wash 15.99 $ and they did n't even wipe down the inside of my car ! then when i called bk to point it out the manager ( robert ) was very defensive and insisted that i could n't prove that they did n't wipe down the inside of my car ! what , how says that to a customer ? terrible service , did n't get what i paid for ....
0	awesome pistachio and dulce de leche . customer service could improve , and prices are outrageous .
0	so , the food was pretty great overall , with the exception of the chewy pork . everything else was just ... weird . went for the 6-course pre fixe nye with wine pairings . the atmosphere is just odd . it 's like they just moved in and have n't had time to decorate or set the environment up . but , i asked , and they 've been there since march . it 's really puzzling . there is nothing on the walls , and i mean nothing . not a painting , art deco something-or-other , sconce , etc . just plain brown walls . and then the majority of the tables have the view of the hallway going to the kitchen and bathrooms . it looks thrown together . the service was confusing as they just kept bring us stuff but not really talking to us . and , when dishes were explained , it was done in such a low voice that i had no idea what i was eating . for almost each course , and we got used to it at some point , a little pitcher of sauce was delivered by a woman with no explanation . then , some random amount of time later ( ~15 min ? ) , a man would bring a course and pour the sauce onto it . the wine was served at odd times for pairings , but the pairings seemed sort of thrown together anyways . the food was pretty creative and delicious for the most part , but i do n't think i 'll go back till i 've heard they have their act together . it would be one thing if they were new ....
0	decent sushi horrid service they forgot half the rolls took them 40 mins to make 4 rolls and was not busy taking excessively long times to bring out nonsushi items had to ask for refills on drinks . will not come back
1	what a beautiful place , went for happy hour great prices , nice portion sizes , beautiful presentation , the staff was friendly an attentive , the food tasted amazing , could n't of asked for a nicer time , the chef was amazing , very professional , would definatly recommend this place an take out of town guests ... loved it ! !
0	i live in las vegas and just called the local number here to get more information . i spoke with jessica and i must say she is probably the rudest person that i have ever spoke with . if she was like that to me , a new prospect , i can only imagine how they treat their actual customers . needless to say , i will not be using their service nor will i refer anyone to them .
1	when i start craving ice cream from here , it 's hard not to give them a five star rating , plus the staff has been super awesome each time i 've visited .
1	do your friend 's a favor , and bring them here for lunch or dinner . i 've turned on 2 more people this week . they are both planning their next pizza 's . hint : they will do half and half , so pick two pizzas in one . if it 's bad it 's your fault . 10 stars !
0	yelp must be broken - this was barely edible . i ca n't possibly understand how the average ranking is so high for this place . honesly , i over-ordered so that i could get a sampling of a few different things . even with that shotgun approach i could not find any of the four dishes that was worth eating even half the portion . is this really the best chinese food in town ? ? it definitely feels like you are in a restaurant in china when you are at a table but .... not when it comes to the food .
0	not terrible stock . but not as good as the store on rainbow .
1	i order from these guys about twice a month .... always friendly on the phone and the food is usually quite good . they 're close to my house so i always pick up . i recommend for those who do n't like pizza chains ( i do n't ) .
0	we drove by this place next to taj mahal , and decided , when we saw a new peruvian place , to stop in for lunch . i had n't had peruvian food for some time , as rincon peruano is a bit far to make it a realistic lunch option . the first thing i noticed is that the menu was very disappointing . the selections were limited , and they were listed in english with spanish translations secondary . sorry , but `` poor man 's steak '' just does not sound as appetizing as `` bistec a la pobre . '' thinking that maybe this was an authentic place that just did n't have everything on the menu , i asked the server if they had parihuela . he looked at me like i was speaking greek , indicating that not only did they not have it , but he was probably not actually a peruvian . with this minor setback behind me , i ordered my food , and what seemed like an eternity later , we had our meals . the portions were acceptable , the presentation was good , but the actual food was pedestrian . it was n't terrible , but rincon peruano did the same dish better , and in greater quantity . the bill ? $ 15 . probably $ 3- $ 4 more than it should 've been . i guess we still do n't have a reasonable peruvian lunch option .
0	i 've been here about 3-4 times so far and though the ambiance is cute , the food continues to disappoint . even with the restaurant.com coupons , the food seemed orverpriced . the only dishes i 've consistently enjoyed are the free bread & hummus and baked brie . meh , i 'm over this place .
1	i just spoke with giovanni , the owner of the business , and while he was n't able to help me with my particular problem , he went out of his way to recommend a few things and suggested a couple of options . wow ! so nice , and so very professional . i 'm very impressed . he 'll be my first call when i need upholstering done .
0	i would give this place 0 stars if i could . on feb 7 , 2013 we paid $ 1,027.40 for two couches from this horrible store . within the first few days , an arm on one of the couches broke . when we tried to fix it , we discovered the furniture was made of cheap particle board and 1x1s . $ 1,000 for that ? seriously ? ? i sent the owner , rick , a message : `` the arm of the $ 1,000 black leather couch you sold us broke within the first few days and we had to rig it up because the receipt and your signs said `` all sales final . '' richard just spoke to kevin and he said that we could have brought it back . '' rick responded : `` i would have ordered the parts to fix or we would have replaced it right away ... i still can ... all i need is some photos of the damage and i will send it on to the company ... no problem ... '' i sent him photos and invited rick to come take a look at the couch . in the meantime , the other couch 's bottom fell entirely through and the couch with the broken arm lost all four of its legs ! they are unusable and we now have clients bringing their own chairs to sit on when they come watch their kids practice karate . rick told us we 'd be able to get a refund , as acme ( the manufacturer ) has a warranty . he stated : `` acme corporation furniture company has agreed to refund the purchase of those two couches they will give me a credit on my account ... '' he told us that he 's not going to carry acme anymore due to several customer complaints . he never once gave us a deadline , expiration date for the warranty , etc . in fact , when he had stated that `` they will give me a credit on my account '' it seemed like everything was set . we had him look for a replacement item over the next few weeks but we found nothing so i told him that we would just take the refund . then , he tells us that we can no longer get a refund because we `` waited too long . '' what ? ? he told us that he has a credit on his account and that we were able to get a refund . now he 's reneging ? ? he sold us poorly constructed , cheap couches and by his own admission , agreed that acme produces furniture that his customers will no longer buy . he told us that his hands are tied . umm , sorry , i 'm a business owner and my hands are never tied when it comes to customer service . lying to and cheating your customers is the most unethical decision a business owner could make . as a business owner , i would never do this to a customer . i highly recommend steering clear from this store . their furniture is cheap . they are disgusting liars just out to make a quick buck . he 'll be out of business in no time if he continues to treat people this way .
0	why would you come here and eat anything besides the $ 7.77 steak special . that is a rhetorical statement , not a question . apparently you have to have a player 's club card , but maybe they do n't ask me for one because i 've frequented the establishment so much . the steak has always been cooked to my liking , mashed potatoes have varied between buttery , creamy goodness , or delicious chunky bites , and the salad is a nice complement even though i do n't even like salad ! to me , this is a 5 star meal for the quality and price . there are 2 stars missing from my rating because every . single . time . i have visited this diner , the service is wack-tastic . especially the last 2 times when i had the same lifeless , blunt , unpleasant and slow server . short for no reason ( in manner , not height ) and just someone i would not want to interact with . i 'm pretty sure my demeanor is friendly and respectful at the least so there is no reason to come at me with that rude ish . and why does it take 15 minutes to get a check when my food is obviously gone ? i hate looking around like i lost my mom at the grocery store ( we are actually both short in height so that has happened quite a bit ) . it wo n't hurt to come here for the special , but make sure you are in the mood to not let anyone ruin your experience .
0	az bread company is good . its not bad , and its not great ... i enjoy it in the morning for a bagel . some co-workers of mine have gotten some salads from them . i have also had a wrap . its not somewhere i have to go , but it is somewhere i enjoy near my job : ) check it out if youre in the area , maybe i just havent had the right menu item
0	i ca n't believe people wait 90 minutes to eat here . maybe it was just an off day but i was disappointed . bad service and bad food . if you ca n't cook eggs correctly , than you have no business serving breakfast .
0	i hated this place from the moment we arrived at the hostess station , but i did n't pick the place and my friends were seemingly committed to it . we waited for 20 minutes for a table for 7 , but they lost our name and then told us to go upstairs to the open air bar where there are no tables at all . what ? ! we went upstairs and sat at a couch/lounge area . the misters were so strong that we were getting practically showered and thus wet . i asked the server if we could turn them off/down . she said , `` i ca n't survive without them ! '' well , i was certainly more concerned about her comfort than mine , or so she assumed . server 1 , me 0 then she tells me that she ca n't do separate checks . i argued , this is a bar , do we have to figure out how to split the bill among those people who are not in our party right next to us ? completely unlogical , and irritating . we were n't all eating , and we were n't all drinking . i lost this dispute . server 2 , me 0. next , you could see her counting how many were in our party . 7. the menu said , parties of 8 or more will be charged gratuity . we had 7. we saw her count . she charged us gratuity . server 3 , me 0. at this point , i was so angry , i almost threw money at her and ran out . food was also terrible . only positive might be the patio/view if i were n't being showered by misters . hated this place . wish i could rate in the negatives .
1	my favorite restaurant on the strip . everything i 've ever eaten there is amazing ( baked cheese app ) and the service is great .
0	i 'm not sure why anyone would come here for bunch ! ! the wait was n't that bad for a sunday , but after waiting for 30 or so minutes , the host sat us down at a table with another couple we did n't know , which was n't so bad because the table sat 6. so after looking at the menu which i thought was pretty small and simple for all the hype about their brunch . the waiter took our order before the other couple , we started off our meal with a warm fruit bowl which was inedible . then the other couple received their meal before us even though we ordered way before them , so after mentioning that to the server he came back a few minutes later with cold food that had to be sitting there waiting to be picked up . so overall i would not ever go back to this place ever again .
0	nothing like waiting 10 minutes at the bar to get service . nothing like watching the other bartender hit on three girls while you sit there , waiting for this unseen bartender to quench your thirst with a tasty man soda . even worse , the other bartender wo n't help you because it 's `` not his section , sorry . '' so we got a table and told the hostess why we were going to take a table to get a couple of beers and an appetizer . she did n't seem to care . the manager even walked by , looked at us , and kept walking . he talked to at least 2 tables around us but skipped us for some reason . what 's really sad about this place is they have so much potential to be good and just fall flat . they have sooo many delicious beers and the staff does n't know anything about beer . this place apparently brews beer and has their own beer on tap but our server could n't even sell us on trying it . he did n't know much about it . it sounded like he did n't know much about beer , which to me is bad if you have 30+ beers on tap and call yourself a pub . my husband tried it and it was pretty decent ; we were quite impressed but puzzled that the server could n't tell us much about it . the food was pretty good and did n't disappoint , but it did take a while to get it ... we probably wo n't be going back to this place again .
0	having met the man twice and finding him quite the entertaining character , i decided to try the restaurant inspired by him . oscar goodman . the ( formerly ) happiest mayor on earth . and former mob defense attorney . he and his image are quintessential vegas . i had to try his steakhouse . entering with a coworker at 8 pm on a monday night , we were seated right away . service can only be described as short and surly . from the hostess to the two servers we encountered , i consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time . a stark contrast to , say , vic & anthony 's steakhouse over at golden nugget ( see separate review ) . the menu is mob-inspired , consisting of names of gangsters you 'll recognize . i went with the spilatro 's steak with garlic mashed potatoes . it may not look like much from the attached photo , bit it was actually quite good . the restaurant is adorned with photos of oscar and his career . i think the theme works fine here , and the location is great . it 's in the area formerly occupied by firefly , directly at the west end of fremont street . the dining area over looks the fremont street experience . it 's an excellent view . all in all , the food was good . the theme was fun . but the service not so much . i 'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service . how do other places like vic 's get it right consistently and places like this do n't ? i think it starts at the top . carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them . consistently . oscar 's needs to make an attempt , here . and until they do , the servers will bring down the house . this may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during spring break week . i sincerely hope they do bring it around because i 'd like to see this place survive . if enough people point this out to them , maybe they will .
1	i lived next to this restaurant for 15 or so years and never went . even when my mom would ask me to because they prepared food they way her mom did when she was young ... nope , that did n't get me to go . needless to say , i 'm not a super big fan of trying new foods that i know nothing about ( thankfully , i 'm changing on that , bare with me ! ) a few years after moving away , i get a new boss at work who 's from cuba . so my work team decided to bring her to havana cafe . after so many years of boycotting this restaurant , i was forced to go . thankfully ! who knew cuban food could be so amazingly delicious ! now that i was `` forced '' to go once , i 've been so many more times and love it even more every time i go . the bistec encebollado ( thinly cut steak with onions on top ) paired with moros ( black beans and rice mixed ) are my absolute fave ! but you ca n't start the meal without getting the calypso chips ( warm plantain chips with a cold black bean dip ) ! havana cafe is now one of my absolute favorite restaurants !
0	pretty cheap but prob bc they 're off the strip at the end of it . the rooms are nice but so far from the strip . nothing to offer really for entertainment here unless you like old couples yelling at each other for spending their social security checks on the slots
1	perfect from start to finish . i wanted to wait a few months and make sure everything was done as expected . we did a layover my current asphalt shingle roof . jared came out , walked me through the whole process and why lyons would be happy to do this job . i made it very clear that i was going to have multiple quotes done and he gave me some great tips and questions to ask . after that whole process they were a bit higher than most ( about $ 1000 ) . after a conversation with jared he was able to make the number fit a bit better . my concern was quality over price and i made that very clear to all roofers who came out for an inspection/estimate . they came out on time to start the job . the crew was very informative and courteous . the job took about 2 days longer than anticipated .... but , i was n't going to be home , and it was my roof . it could have taken them a month and it would n't have hurt my feelings . when i got home from my trip i had a new roof , new ridge top vent , new chimney cover , painted roof fixtures , and a new ac unit put back exactly as it should have been . yard was spotless as well . i would recommend these guys to anyone . another very deciding factor , was they would handle any and all insurance clams due to hail , rain , or wind . that 's really important as those things are common here in arizona . piece of mind , from a great local company , that follows that up with great work !
0	i have a love/hate relationship with this place . on one hand they have one of the most delicious salads i 've ever eaten with all my favorite stuff in it . the `` bleu cheese & walnut salad '' has dried cranberries , tomatoes , strawberries & balsamic vinaigrette dressing on a bed of mixed greens ... and it comes with a muffin . it 's just awesome . dang , i want one now . * drools a little * the downside is that the restaurant itself is one of those kitchy , family-friendly chains with garish , faux-french crap littering the walls . really , it 's just too much . eating here makes me feel like such a tool . what 's the solution ? get it to go ! i can place an order for my coveted salad and walk out the door with it 5-10 minutes later to be eaten wherever i please . sweet !
0	i really like the location and the layout of the restaurant/bar . great place to watch some sports and have a beer . however , for a vegetarian who likes ipa 's this is n't the place to go . pizza or salad are your only real choices . from a beer standpoint , i just do n't like german beers , so thats my fault not theirs . their hefeweizen is actually pretty good , but i really do n't go beyond that . i do n't like the pilsners , lagers or kolsches . i wish they 'd go outside the box and do some more styles of brewing and add some vegetarian things to the menu . as it is , we really only go about 2x a year due to the limited options . not saying it 's a bad place , unless you are a vegetarian .
0	i am only giving this review 3 stars because of matt . we waited at total of an hour and a half for service at the bar and the table , we actually never got service at the table for 20 minutes . that 's when we decided to leave . we payed for bottomless mimosas and only got 2 for the hour and a half we were there . matt took care of our tab , not expected but super appreciated . thank you for making us actually want to come back just based on integrity of your restaurant . much appreciated . they were also very under staffed and we get that so thank you for trying guys !
0	on a sat , there was only 1 waitress for the whole restaurant . not once i was asked if i needed anything . service did not meet my expectations because no one would come to my table . a little smelly as well , not food but odor coming from the silk plants that has not been cleaned . not coming back
1	shopped here a few times when it was lowes foods , but never really was a fan . i never could find the low prices everyone spoke of ; when they did run sales it was never for things i needed . now it has reopened as a harris teeter and that 's fine with me . the retrofit was done very nicely , the produce section in particular looks great ; nice selection of organics . the only minor quibble i have about the teeters is that each one is laid out slightly differently , which can make it a bit more time consuming finding items if you stop by different stores . they are staffed for bear this weekend ; everyone is almost as bubbly as if it were a trader joes . almost . 10 % of everything this weekend with your vic card , so check it out if you 're in the area this weekend .
0	the server offered a taster , but took it to another table . after 20 minutes , we had to flag down a different server to get a beer .
1	we to the amazing thai bistro on a friday night . the food was great . i had gluten free seafood curry . very spicy . we had a large party and they were very accommodating . we sat at the bar waiting for our friends and some how they handed out free shots ! bonus for my friends that drink . i will be going back and enjoying this great place ! they do have a gluten free ! ! ! !
0	too many people working but nothing getting done . took too long for my order . i asked for refund . i 'll check in a few days to know if it went through . they gave me another order gratis that they messed up . they were friendly but too slow . time is of the essence in an airport .
0	i tried making an appointment by phone and when i asked if they took my insurance , they told me that i would have to call and see if they were in my network . how is it they ca n't tell me if they take my insurance ? why are they making me do all the work ? no thanks . next .
1	wow . ca n't believe that it took this long to check out bean ! some may be a little deterred by the idea of veganism , but chef really puts an end to that debacle . the flavors here are incredible , innovative , thoughtful , and really fun . we came in on a saturday afternoon and pretty much every table in the main dining area was full . we sat immediately , however , and worked our way up and down the menu . the service was friendly and very helpful with some of the items i was unfamiliar with . we placed our order and had a chance to just hang out whilst waiting . it did take a while to get our food , but chef was the only person in the kitchen and seriously putting in some hustle . fun to watch ! our food came . delicious . i ordered the buffalo bean bowl -- rice , kidney beans , kale , vegan ranch , and tofu coated in buffalo sauce . it was magic . so flavorful and all of the spices swirled around magnificently . we also ordered a side of the northern white beans , more kale , and braised cabbage . all were perfect . it 's so nice when fresh veggies are flavorful in their own right and not slathered with butter or some bogus sauce . chef really puts time into making each item flavorful . my wife ordered the seitan burger sans bun . it was wonderfully smoky and hearty . each of our plates came with a banana nut muffin . holy cow ! those things are amazing ! no dairy whatsoever . we were stuffed . so much food and both of us dined for less than $ 30 . where i love the food and the staff , i think the ambiance is a little droll . think their still working on the space and trying to liven it up a bit . some simple decor would be great . also , the men 's room is a little dingy . not a huge deal , but think it just lends itself to being a dated building off of independence . though a bit difficult to get into ( hyperspeed traffic on independence blvd ) , it 's totally worth it . i ca n't wait to go back .
1	so i do n't ever go downtown because well downtown is kind of icky . eh , whatever i guess that 's really besides the point . anywho , after getting my eyebrows done at princess nails from michelle ( eyebrow fairy ! ) i needed to cut a new set of keys because apparently holding onto keys is lost on me . i doubt my landlord wants to be woken up at 2:00am to let me in again either . after calling 7349651474 locksmiths that would n't duplicate keys because they 're stooopid someone from the office depot sent me to ulrichs shoe repair . yes , shoe repair . fix your shoe , make a key . upon entering ulrichs ( i think it was the owner ) was super friendly and i 'll give him credit for being somewhat funny . gave him my keys and in literally 30 seconds flat both keys were made and they both worked . usually going to somewhere like home depot you have to go back like 3 times for the key to work properly . not in this case . overall customer service amazing . quality of service amazing . plus super cheap too ! $ 2 bucks a key . um that 's a deal if i ever saw one .
0	to be honest , lulu does not deserve any stars . the food here is mediocre at best . the food is either too bland or overly salty . the waiters/waitress here have an attitude and are very impolite . sometimes they forget to bring utensils , napkins , or plates . one time they pretty much forgot to bring me my food . it also takes me a lot of effort for a waiter/waitress to pour me water every time . the cashier yelled at me once for using a credit card . it might just be my personal opinion , but i feel like the staffs are nicer to white customers than asian customers . also , rose tea cafe has the best bubble tea in pittsburgh , not lulu 's .
1	great steak which was the most important thing , got the porterthouse for two . the stuffed potato was minimalistic ( not stuffed ) and totally uninspiring . waiter was a good guy , hostess was a post high school vacuous tart who clearly wasnt listening .
1	everyone needs a local sushi dive , where saki is poured when needed and sashimi reigns supreme . wild tuna fills the bill . happy hour roll specials on week nights make the perfect stop in after a long day . the only waitress is friendly if only just competent , but the job gets done and the rolls are scrumptious . make sure to drop in before 7 to get the half off specials .
0	i do n't often get down to the arboretum area , but we were over that way one morning and decided to stop for a bite at the charlotte cafe as a change of pace . it 's an interesting little place - nothing too pretentious ( like le peep can be ) , just a little cafe that has a diner feel to it . you have a decent choice of menu options , and most of them are pretty good-sized for the price . while not the cheapest place in town , you do get a good amount of food , and we found that the staff was very friendly , and the always kept the drinks filled - something that is tough to find these days ( and something that i 'm always picky about ) !
1	just stepping inside , you get an immediate feeling that this is going to be really really good . i clutched my wallet several times to make sure i had not forgotten it . it would take a hell of a lot of dish washing to pay this bill ! i had not even sat down yet ! on this visit i was with out my niece , my brother and his friend . we sat in the lounge where live music provided jazzy energy to the room . it seemed like the ceilings were low and the glass partitions between the dining room and lounge were just illusions . there was a flurry of activity from the various servers and other guests . the place was jumping ! one by one , our white napkins were immediately replaced with black ones as if to signify we were an active table . we selected sparkling and still water for the table although all of us ended up drinking the sparkling . it seemed to be the perfect rinse for our palettes . our martini 's , however , were the best rinse of all our woes . a bread basket that featured a variety of crusty temptations arrived next . we ordered the standard steamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes as our sides . just because , we added snap peas and sweet potato fries too ! my niece had just the cesar salad which she said was amazing . that did not stop the rest of us from ordering the fillet . once everything began arriving , it was very difficult to keep up . there seemed to be a dozen hands replacing silverware , collecting old plates moving and refilling glasses and shaking the last drops of poison from the martini carafes . finally the meal was perfectly in place . it was a sight to behold- everything was steaming hot and vibrant with color . i do n't have to tell you that it all tasted even better than it looked . our server check in frequently . the music continued to thrill and the meal settled in our bellies with satisfaction . even though we were completely filled , it did not stop us from diving in to the drmy butter cake with freshly whipped cream on the side .
0	ridiculous . i have had better fresher sushi from a supermarket . the place is overpriced and completely poor quality . pretty sure they gave us canned tuna and canned crab soaked in mayo . the service is a joke . it took forever to place an order , the woman next to us had to flag down a waitress to even get a drink order and she was there longer than us . the servers checked on us once after we received our food . we literally waited more than 20 minutes to get the check and another ten to get my card back . the rolls are so oversize and we did not even get a plate to put our rolls down . i am pretty sure most of these reviews are fake or these people have never had semi-decent sushi . the rolls were just a huge mess and fell apart if you tried to move them . each bite of sushi here was equivalent of three bites of normal sushi . i was really excited because this place had such amazing reviews . i just wasted 40+ dollars on a terrible experience . i should have just gone to a supermarket or gas station , because at least they are honest about ripping me off .
0	i definitely wo n't be going to this place again . first off , who puts pink roses on a ninja turtle cake ? that 's just bad planning right there . secondly , the cake was terribly bland . thirdly , after many attempts via e-mail ( since i live in california ) to get them to use the right image to put on the cake , their inability to respond to let me know what images would work and what would n't led us to a horribly pixelated cake , even though i had sent them a better , higher-resolution image . when i picked up the cake , i laughed in astonishment at the hideous pink roses they had used to border the cake , and they listlessly scraped them off and bordered it with pale green squiggles , still not really fitting if you ask me , especially with the pink frosting remnants that remained . if a deposit had n't already been put on the cake , i would n't have bothered taking it , but this was a travesty .
0	its so bad ! i dont know what kind of lsd the other reviewers were on ( obviously the good stuff ) but seriously its that bad . stay away !
1	we enjoyed our stay here . only complaint is the noise level coming from the hogs and heifers bar until two o'clock in the morning . if loud noises bother you make sure to ask for a room that faces away from the bar .
0	accomodations ( rooms/suites , staff , restaurants etc . ) are very good . my only complaint is the plazzo/venetian complex does not accept responsibility for lost or stolen items . case in point ; on a recent visit to vegas my wife , niece and i did some shopping at the north las vegas outlet . we made several purchases , including two identical purchases that my wife and neice made from one of the oulet stores . upon our return to the palazzo , we had our car valet parked and left all of our purchases in the back of our suv . we did not take the car out again until the next morning when we checked out to go home . we stopped no where between the hotel and our home in southern california . when we got home , we noticed that the two purses were missing . i immediately called the hotel and was conected with the security department , who initiated an investigation . a week later when i called for an update on their investigation , the facility 's risk management office informed me that the investigation had been closed with no action to be taken . i was informed that the hotel would not reimburse us for the missing purses , which did not surprise me as that was not my reason for requesting the investigation . what did surprise me was their insistance that the hotel takes no responsibility for items left in your car even when they have charge of the vehicle . i thought at a minimum that they would at least offer to comp us for a room on our next visit , as a good will gesture . nada ! although this $ 300 mistake was a good lesson for us to learn , needless to say we wo n't be staying at either the palazzo or the venetian anytime soon .
0	so most of the reviews we read showed how the flamingo was a bad hotel . i beg to differ . we got a great rate for room and flight through vegas.com $ 236 for a flight and hotel for 2 nights , 3 days . we were n't expecting much for the room , because who stays in there room in vegas anyways ? pool : why we chose the flamingo , the pool ! the go pool is totally worth the stay . there is one major big pool with a waterfall and there is a small pool towards the entrance . the upstairs area pool is for kids and families . there are palm trees in the water and there is a small lagoon area . dancers come out at around 11 - 12:00 pm noon to dance while trendy tunes are blasting around . they have happy hour specials from 8 to 12 pm . $ 20 bucket of beer ( 5 ) and $ 5 bloody marys and coors light cans . there is a grotto , several drink stands and servers that walk around to take orders of food and drinks . we ordered a chicken quesadilla and chicken tenders and were super happy with the taste and portions . ca n't complain here . you are not supposed to bring in food or drink . they will allow coffee and water . yes , things are a bit expensive in regards to drinking at the pool . their collective flamingo cup with slushy alcoholic beverage runs about $ 22 . get there at 8:00 am when the pool opens , so you can get a good seat , otherwise you wo n't find one and you will have to lay your towel out by the pool and sit . cabanas get booked fast . daybeds are $ 249 . not sure how much lounge chairs are . think you can book ahead on the cabanas , possibly online . need your id and room key to get into the pool , so plan ahead ! towels as you walk in . room : we arrived around 11:00 pm . we asked for an early check in . it would have been $ 30 , which is n't a big deal . but the lady asked us if we wanted an upgrade for $ 20 and she would wave the early check in rate . sold . our room overlooked caesar 's palace . the beds had white sheets and covers with a pinkish furry thing at the end of our bed . there were two flamingo property photographs that were trendy on the walls . the couch was grey with pink trimming and our view was great . we were pleased with what we had . yes , the bathroom looks a bit dated , but everything was functional and clean . again , you should n't be in your room , so we were happy with the location on the strip and our view . the flamingo is a great location on the strip . you can easily get to caesar 's and its about a 10-15 min walk to bellagio and the paris . about a 20 min walk to cosmopolitan and aria . taxi cab rides to cosmpolitan or aria were about $ 10 . split the costs with your friends and you are saving a lot more money . amenities like coffee , shampoo/conditioner in one , soap . tv was fine and the ac worked very well . tip : if you have a total rewards card , you go into check in a lot quicker . we bypassed 100 guests by going into the total rewards line for check in . cha ching ! if you do n't have one , go over to the total rewards desk , get your total rewards card and then go check in . you 'll save time . also , your total rewards card will get you discounts here and there on harrah 's properties ( harrahs , flamingo , the quad , caesar 's , ballys etc ) paradise buffet : we were planning on going off the strip for lunch , but we were at the flamingo and saw a buffet . we paid $ 30 but added on a $ 9.99 all you can drink beer , wine , bloody marys , mimosas deal . the buffet was typical with prime rib , shrimp , chicken , pasta , salad , mac and cheese and lots of desserts . i drank my $ 9.99 mimosas and beers and had a great buzz going on ! so , if you sit there for awhile and drink , you 'll get your moneys worth , especially since all the casinos charge so much for drinks . of course you could sit at a machine or gamble and stock up , but that could get expensive . so remember that many of the harrah 's properties have the $ 9.99 all you can drink option for their buffets , expect for caesar 's bacchanal buffet . casino payoffs : pretty good . i had luck here . played star wars , played sex and the city and the hangover and won money , so i 'm a happy camper . there are flamingos as the pool , real live ones . saw a lot of people eating at a pizza bar located by the paradise buffet . looked and smelled delicious . a reasonable price to stay at a central location . they have renovated areas and rooms , so give it a try . again , dont compare it to bellagio , encore , wynn or the new places . if you want to save some money , stay here .
1	fat . fat . fatty . fattyness . so fat . fat . fat . fat . die . that 's how you feel when you eat here . much like all las vegas buffets , wicked spoon offers a huge variety of things to eat and you will eat until you feel like vomiting . or you can take a poop break mid-meal ( like my husband ) and continue on when your stomach creates more space . i filled up quickly on their mac-n-cheese bar , the pastas , and their pizza . luckily for me , i have two stomachs ( like a cow . ) one for regular meals , and one for desserts . they have a large dessert section at wicked spoon , complete with a gelato/sorbet bar . so save room for dessert , if you do n't have two stomachs like me . some of the great things about this buffet was that it was n't crowded ... it was actually pretty empty , the price is fairly reasonable , and it is located in the cosmopolitan hotel . such a pretty hotel to visit if you have n't been !
0	this place needs help . i came for the batting cages . it looked closed when i pulled into the big parking lot . but at the end of the creepily quiet building is where we buy the tokens for the cages . i only saw two employees for this place . i so wish more people come here . it could be a real hot stop .
1	i ca n't believe their doughnuts are vegan ! the boston cremes are amazing . they also have soy milk for the coffee .
1	i used to associate this ultra-chic restaurant/bar with those who liked to be seen in edinburgh ( yah 's etc ) as it was once a private-members club , so imagine my surprise when i went to hawk and hunter for a friends birthday - it was really , really lovely ! ! the decor is really chic and the toilets are amongst some of the best i 've ever experienced in edinburgh . there are two quality indicators i like to use when reviewing places - the toilet and the temperature of the wine . i give hawke and hunter 10 out of 10 for both . especially the bathroom , it 's worth visiting for that reason alone . the georgian style of the restaurant is typical of edinburgh new-town , with a really dramatic sweeping staircase taking you up to the bar , and up again to the restaurant . it 's really cool , and i loved just sitting on the sofa 's looking around me . the only thing i would criticize , which i would by lying if i said i did n't expect , was the price . you just know you 're going to be paying for the drink as well as for the surroundings . otherwise , it 's really worthwhile paying it a visit . plus it 's open till 3am - for the suave amongst us who like to be out but do n't like the stinky clubs , this is the place to go .
0	i stayed here during my visit in dec. 2011 and let 's just say it was n't what i expected . i did n't plan this trip . i was pretty much a fill in at the last minute . i did n't know what i was getting myself into . the hotel itself is old and it smells weird in the lobby . they had entertainment and restaurants but we were n't interested in neither . i did however eat at a mexican restaurant at the food court . the gentlemen who worked there were very nice and the food was pretty good . there was an indoor pool but it was only for senior citizens ... really people ? the beds were very comfy and and the linens were clean . we had a fabulous view of what looked like a vacant outdoor pool area and the tacky looking circus circus hotel across the street . it 's a decent hotel if you 're on a budget and want to experience the old vegas feel . however it 's located on the old strip so you 'll have to walk or drive to the excitement . i was there almost a year ago so i do n't know what it 's like now .
0	my wife and i visited las vegas during memorial day weekend . we visited this casino several times . my wife won money playing bingo and i won money playing video poker . the casino is nice and has good ventilation . the staff ( waitresses , bingo runners , dealers ) were very friendly . we did not stay in the hotel because they charge `` resort fees . '' as much gambling as we do , we do not feel that we should have to pay resort fees . we stayed at another fremont street hotel/casino that does not believe in this `` resort fee '' garbage . if the plaza ever stops this resort fee nonsense , then we would love to stay here .
0	burglary hotel ! we just entered this hotel `` the quad '' on november 21st to stay with my parents and left everything in the room and went down to get water in 10 mins all are expensive gadgets and my id and my parents passports and money were robbed ! and im sure this is an inside job ! after seeing so many burglery incidents here in the span of three months ( for proof - see facebook page `` the quad casino and resort '' ) im guessing its bad management from they side for not warning or safe quarding they customers after so many customers are being robbed ! ! sadly our trip was badly ruined because of 'the quad ' ! please do n't stay here ! guessing management and security are involved coz there blame each other but wont resolve the issue !
0	i was kind of expecting a burlesque show with , well , more feathers , or a giant martini glass , or something a bit less one-layer of bikini top . it was entertaining , and who can turn down hot women doing rather fine dancing , but it was n't so much burlesque as it was like a quick one-minute striptease and out . the comedian was amusing but brief ; back into the breach of more and more sort of strip-dancing . alright for $ 35 with friends .
1	went here for breakfast and the selection and food was good .
0	ok , let me start by saying , i 've only been once , and i wish there was a 3.5 star rating . perhaps if i go back more , they 'll earn the 4th star . on a recent stay in vegas we were given a $ 50 dining credit to be spend on a `` fine dining '' restaurant in the mgm grand . we chose this restaurant because they had the broadest selection of food given the choices . from the hostess stand outside , and the decor , it gives you the appearance of fine dining , but i 'd have to say different parts of the experience do n't say fine dining . in my book to qualify for fine dining , music should be soft in the background and you should n't notice it it should just be a light soundtrack . music was a little loud and they played an electric selection . also to be fine dining , tables should be far enough spaced apart so you can talk in a normal inside voice and not hear your neighbors conversation and also be far enough away that you can make a graceful exit to the ladies room without bits of your body being in front of the people at the next table . also , long sleeved flannel shirts should n't be allowed . the waitress and serving staff were very professional , my water glass never got lower than half , and they did n't get that snooty ignore-you-attitude because we did n't order alcohol . menu choices ranged from burgers to seafood to chops which was nice , there is something for just about everyone . to start they bring you grilled bread that has been grilled on actual wood which was tasty , but we only got 2 pieces and we noticed the tables next to us ( which are so close you ca n't help but notice what is going on ) got a basket full . luckily one of the servers came over right away and asked if we would like more . for entrees i got the kurobuta pork chop which came with swiss chard and toasted farro salad . my dining companion chose bacon wrapped scallops which came with sauteed vegetables and lentils . i do not eat seafood , so i did n't taste the scallops , but they were larger , and my dining companion said they were delicious . i got a taste of the vegetables that were n't near the scallops , and they were various shades of carrots sauteed in butter and they were good . the lentils came out in a small iron crock which made it easy to share , unfortunately they were not share-worthy . basic plain , meh lentils with not much other flavor . the pork chop was cooked over wood , nicely charred on the outside but juicy on the inside . it was my first time with kurobuta pork and while it was nice and juicy , i ca n't say the flavor was any better than regular pork . the swiss chard was braised and delicious and the toasted farro salad was really , really good . i 'd never had farro before but based on this i am now a big fan . to cap off the night a delicious silky smooth maple creme brulee which had a nice maple flavor without being overpowering or artificial tasting . on the way out , all the servers we had made a point to wish us a good night which i thought was nice . i 'd like to go back again , and perhaps try other dishes , i would have liked it better if we were n't packed in like sardines with tables being six inches away from each other , i was close enough to hold hands with the person next to me . the restaurant was no where near full by the time we left , so we could have been spaced out more .
1	this coffee shop is fantastic . i have been a customer for years . they are at least twice as fast as other coffee shops and the customer service is top notch . the reason i kept coming back when i originally found this place was the smiling faces and how well i was treated . i ca n't say enough about moka or their friendly staff .
1	best pizza in vegas - and they 're open 24 hours ! you can order takeout any time of day and the quality is always amazing . the duck tacos are to die for , and they do a great job with hummus and salads . we 're working our way through the full pizza menu , and i have n't had one pizza that was n't head & shoulders above all the other pizza places in vegas . if you 're looking for a good , quality meal late ( i 'm not talking taco bell or jack in the box ) this is the place to be . late night dine-in specials include 1/2 off appetizers , and the jukebox is n't half bad ...
1	great food , great atmosphere . friendly staff !
0	pros : the place is spotless and the service was great . prices are reasonable and the foods made fresh to order . cons : the food was absolutely flavorless . i rarely need to add salt to my food but it was needed on every item . chicken was bland and the rice was terrible . the best part of the meal was the pita . nice place with a great staff but the food was average at best . i would n't return on my own but if someone insisted on going i 'd be ok with it .
0	we had dinner here with family and friends . the food was n't bad , but the service was down right lousy . asked for water twice and never received any . they took away our teapot and never brought it back . the rest of our party was n't even there yet and a couple of waiters came by to ask if we were ready to order . need i say more .... we had the garlic ginger lobster with yee mien base , salt and pepper pork chops , stir fried garlic pea pods , frog hot pot and if you spend over $ 38 , they give you a dish of either steamed chicken or soya sauce duck for free but on the other hand if you do n't ask for it , they wo n't bring it out to you . i saw tables with over $ 38 of food but no chicken or duck . this is not honest in my books . anyway , the lobster was quite good , but i did not particularly like the noodle base that we ordered for it . the salt and pepper pork chop was a little bit too salty and was too fatty for my taste . the pea pods on the other hand was perfectly prepared and the frog hot pot was quite delightful , no fishy taste . the place was very busy when we arrived , but after 9:30pm it died down considerably . i 'd give this place 3 stars just for the food but minus 1 star for lousy service and dishonest .
0	i love thai food and have had it often . this food was disappointing . chicken was minced and green beans raw . i asked for eggplant added to my dish and it was not prepared correctly . we left money on the table and left with only eating a few bites .
0	there hours here are what attracts me the most , especially last semester when i was up until 6am doing networks and needed coffee . the coffee here is actually good especially if you get a shot in it . the espresso are ... eh ... and the pizzas are pretty greasy . in fact most of the food here is n't that great , but when it 's hot , a fro-yo comes in quite handy .
0	im finding it very hard to rate this place ! i have been for dinner a bunch of times and some of those times disappointed and then i came for easter brunch and it was really disappointing ! ! so i 've liked it and i 've hated it ! ! dinner has been good with the exception of dishes that i 've learned not to order again . while at the same time i 've fallen in love with some other dishes ! ! the dreadful easter buffet was really a let down it had sooo much potential but it really made us sad ! ! one thing i can say was they had good deviled eggs ! they had gnocchi with a mushroom cream something ... gross , a penne bolognese ... grosser , it was so dried out and bland and horrendous looking . paella was just not good ! they had a carving station where the prime rib was all fat and the ham was dry . now i think my biggest let down was that it was brunch and they did n't have any breakfast food out ! ! you ca n't call it brunch with no breakfast food ! ! please call it `` unch '' because there was no `` br '' in sight ! ! i will go back for there normal `` brunch '' because the menu has breakfast items on it and it looks good so we will see ! ! wish me luck ! !
1	i stayed here overnight en route ottawa . you are pretty much paying for the location . all in one morning , we visited old montreal , chinatown and st. denis ( a street with restaurants and pubs ) walking . the rooms are very minimal . yes there are two flights of stairs if you get the room on the third floor , but if you have a carry on it is pretty manageable . the bed was really comfortable that my boyfriend and i missed breakfast . couple of tips : 1. note that only one person would be able to log on the wi-fi at the same time in one room . 2. giovanni ( one of the owners ) is very helpful . ask him for directions and ways to get around . 3. the reception desk has limited hours , call in advance and tell them the exact time you will be arriving so they will be able to open doors for you . once you are in , you 'll get security codes to get inside . 4. they only have soap . be sure to get toiletries in advance ( there is a bodega-like place right next door , and there is a big pharmacy right down the street ) . if you are looking for luxurious hotel experience , this is not the place for you . if you are on a budget , need to get to places and a solid bed to sleep , hotel stay centre ville will suffice all your needs .
0	it appears the lfc is closed . last few times i have been by , it has been dark .. sad to see it go .. when it was good , it was really good .... just a shame that they were so inconsistent .
0	fun fact : the number listed above ( 608.259.1668 ) is not the number for lee 's garden . i 'm thinking it might be the downtown location for hong kong cafe . i called the number to place an order for delivery , and after giving my address the person taking my order said they did n't deliver to my location anymore . most delivery drivers have never heard of my road , so i figured they thought i was farther west than i am . i 'm only about a 1.5 miles away , so i switched my order to pick-up . when i got to lee 's garden , i told the person at the register i had an order for pickup . she checked the kitchen , then went and got a manager . the manager asked what he could do for me , and i said i had a pickup order for sesame chicken . he said no problem , sesame chicken is quick , 10 minutes . this means there is a lonely order of sesame chicken congealing somewhere far , far away . poor little guy . as for the chicken i got - it 's okay . the veggies are good , but the ratio 2/3 veggies , 1/3 chicken - and for $ 10 i wish it was reversed , or at least equal . the food is good quality , but it 's pretty flavorless . there 's some heat to it , but not a lot of spice , if that makes sense . in any case , it 's the best chinese food i 've found on the west side , but i think i 'll try something else next time to see if i can bump this up to four stars .
1	this is the place for excellent tacos . would love to see tacos al pastor on the traditional gyro spit tho .
1	ravenous is a great sandwich bar located on dundas street and offers great quality food at very good prices . the sandwich bar is relatively new to edinburgh and opened only a few months ago . i was first attracted to the bar by the modern d\u00e9cor and the cool name . the bar does breakfasts and lunches- in the morning you can have porridge and rolls , although i have not tried this yet . in the afternoon , you can get a good selection of sandwiches , soups and paninis and there is also a good range of salads , where you can get a selection of salad to choose from to put in a salad box . there is a few seats in there although not many , and the place can get pretty busy at lunch times as the office workers fill the place , but the staff were very good at providing quick and polite service .
1	one of my favorite places in tempe , i get really good vibes here , all of the staff are friendly and the owner is great ! you can order anything off the menu and pretty much be amazed by it . i am upset for 1 reason though , after having a vanilla latte here i can no longer enjoy a latte from other places , it is n't the same ! i wish i lived a bit closer to crepe bar , but when i go it is always a great treat ! i recently had a meet-up here : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=m9xb1wzwjte thank you for your superb customer service : )
0	empty tables . told 15 minute wait . ok. 5 minutes into wait ( by the door , bumping elbows with counter patrons ) , 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes . we left at that point
1	great selection ! great prices !
1	on my last night in vegas , i figured i 'd hit the strip for some tried and true authentic thai cuisine at none other than the famous lotus of siam . located in a dilapidated old strip mall north of the main strip , you 'd easily miss this place if you sneezed but make no mistake , this place is the real deal folks ! at check in , we were told it would be a grueling 45 minute wait . we were then invited to the bar to pass the time . needless to say , we enjoyed a shot or two at the bar and made some new friends in some cool gals . before we knew it , our table was ready ! way less than 45 minutes i might add . our server was kind courteous and very helpful . she took our orders and within moments , our tasty dishes were basking on our table . sea bass drunken noodles - if you like chow fun , you will enjoy every bite of this phenomenal dish ! order it medium spicy and top it with the buttery sea bass and you 'll be good to go ! satisfaction guaranteed ! crispy duck - served with a coconut panang curry sauce , i was blown away by the incredible texture and zesty tang of the panang curry , awesomely delicious ! garlic prawns - jumbo prawns served nice and crispy with the most enticing aroma i 've experienced in years . it will make you drool at first whiff and the explosive garlicky flavor will keep you pining for another decadent bite ! overall , awesome service , impeccable food and good times = a+++ from this guy happy eats !
0	the first time i went to l'etoile was back in 2000 while i was attending school there . it was a `` stumble upon '' as a friend and i were just walking around the capital square and decided to enter . at that time , it was in a different building on the same street . we walked up the stairs to the second level . dressed in street clothes we almost turned away , but the staff was so warm and inviting . i preferred this location much more than it 's current all open , no privacy , and wall to wall windows ... definitely lacks the warmth that it 's previous location had which was more victorian ' esque . and , being a vegetarian i remembered that there was still at least one soup , appetizer , and mid course and entree which catered to my diet . i still remember the entree to this day , which was spinach , shiitake mushrooms , and tomatoes in a saffron like sauce but placed in phyllo wrappings . in 2000 , 6 stars ... my last visit was very nice but my taste buds were n't exploding . and at a cost of $ 160 plus a $ 25 tip i would have rather gone to a few of my other favorite restaurants in madison , like kabul , chautara , himalchuli , baraka , etc . thankfully my date paid , but i talked it up so much , i think he probably felt the same . i was also bummed out that there were less choices for vegetarians . the entree i picked ( the only option ) was a cute idea ... little pumpkins that were filled with seasonal ingredients , but definitely not worth $ 36 . the salad was good , but again , overpriced ... i can get a ridiculously delicious salad somewhere else for half the price . and since it was a semi chilly day , mid fall , i was craving a bowl of soup . big mistake l'etoile ... any restaurant , especially a high end one should always have a vegetarian soup as an option . this establishment emphasizes local organic food , and many of those types are going to draw in vegetarians . when i asked the server if they could make a soup he said no . the attitude was more snobby than the last time and i was even dressed much more formally . not going to eat here again . sorry `` l'etoile '' , but you are no longer `` the star '' restaurant which you claim to be .
0	this was an ok experience .... thanks to my awesome friend 's dad 's winning ... he treated us to this restaurant for my friend 's birthday .... very pricey restaurant ! ! ! ! ! the food was ok ..... i did n't think it was that special . high priced chinese food . hmm ... oh and we had fiji water ... haha .... that was extra cash spent there .... anyways .. all in all .... i didn'tsee anything that special here .. just that it was a nice looking restaurant . =x
0	anyone who eats at tj 's homestyle restaurant is taking their life into their own hands ! seriously , we sat at the counter and i have never seen such a disgusting display of unsafe food handling . there was one waitress working that was not sick all of the rest were and non bothered to wash their hands after coughing into them , or touching dirty rags , or running their hands through their greasy hair . our waitress took our orders then ignored us , fortunately the gal not coughing on herself was the one that realized our food was sitting there getting old . the 2 people seated and served after us had already gotten their food and left the restaurant before we got our food . prices were cheap , but in this case you really do get what you paid for . definately not worth the wait for a seat . not worth your time !
0	my son has been going there with his friends and though its different times of the day , he has been finding hair in his food . that 's fucking disgusting . i hope this place goes out of business . my family will never eat there again .
1	everything was incredible ! ! ! from the drinks , appetizers , entrees , and desserts . ambiance was relaxing . monica was amazing definitely would recommend her . great service and made us laugh all night . thank you for a wonderful time and making sure we try the chocolate bread pudding
0	gross and disgusting- what happened ? i used to live in area and the food was really good . now it smells in there like damp and sewer and the furniture and carpet are dated . the food is nasty ! tortilla chips are over cooked . pollo fundido is supposed to be shredded chicken crispy tortilla and cream cheese . we got greasy stewed chicken meat , soggy tortilla , a smear of cream cheese . i asked the server why my fundido was n't crispy and she told me that the cheese makes it soggy ! obviously she 's never had a decent fundido - only the garbage they serv there . and when i asked for more cream cheese they charged me for it . next time i want pollo fundido ill go to carlos obrians . but ill never go back to valle luna on cave creek , so disappointing and not worth the $ 32 we spent on 2 lunch entrees .
1	so much fun will be had in vegas this week ! i figured the only time i will be coherent enough to write my own name i might as well get the review completed . we started off with some pints in the phx airport and sat next to another hot chick that let me touch her leg every now and then ... and got word that we would be partying with perez hilton for his b day ! great things about the new york new york staff is that they follow the vegas rule ! tip and be spoiled ! we had a laugh with the desk clerk talked about our bfs allowing to have a girl weekend and got the free upgrade ! ! ! woohoo ! ! ! the beds are amazing ! i do n't find us spending too much time in them though . the record label got us into pretty much into everything . but any resort that knows a gay man needs his cuddle pillow that goes between my legs is 5 star to this yelper ! ! ! enjoy life everyone !
1	my wife and i were looking for a nice dinner after the michael jackson immortal show in vegas .... thought this place would work nicely . this was my 2nd stint at this place ( 1st time was w/my boys for my bachelor party ) , i must say this place does not disappoint . for appetizers i started with the stone crab ( their famous for ) and crab cakes , both were pretty delicious . ordered the 20 oz bone-in ribeye w/garlic creamed spinach and hash browns . their service is superior , if you 're looking for a meal that will do the job , here it is , lol there 's only 2 of these in the u.s. one in vegas and the other is where else .... miami .
1	spam , eggs , and rice was delish ! it 's a nice little whole in the wall with friendly staff . if you 're in downtown las vegas , its a place you should visit
1	excellent breakfast spot , two of us ate and the food was fantastic . bannana cream pie pancakes ( yes thats what they were ) , were as fantastic as they sound , , , ,it was bannannriffic . bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly and bacon was tasty . definately not the cheapest , but you get what you pay for . this is definately a place worth frequenting if you enjoy breakfast out .
0	after reading reviews on yelp we decided to try this place . the iced tea was terrible , light brown and had a weird after taste . the salsa & chips were disappointing , all i could taste on the mild salsa was thei onion but my husband said the hot salsa was better . we had a quesadilla which was okay . my son had a bean burrito with rice , he loved the burrito but generally is n't a fan of spanish rice . my husband has the chile rellano and was disappointed . i had the machaca chimi & beans . both my husband & my plate were beyond hot ! the refried beans were actually bubbling ! i am not exaggerating when i tell you we had to wait about 20 minutes to eat our food because it was so hot ! in all fairness the chimi & beans were actually good but overall not a pleasant experience.the service was okay but not great . sad to say we were sorely disappointed !
0	i have been twice now . the thing that assaults me as soon as i walk in the door is the smell of baby poop . i have no idea what causes the smell but it is very strong . my children noticed and mentioned it to me the moment they walked through the doors also . the sat at the table with their noses plugged . my kids liked the deep fried tofu for $ 3.50 and it was a good portion size . 8 large chunks of tofu . i tried the braised noodle with sesame paste ( vegetarian ) for $ 4 . it was so plain with very little taste . tasted slightly like peanut sauce . i had to cover it in srarachi to get it down because i was so hungry . kids liked the beef with fried noodles for $ 7.95 . with the tofu it was enough food for my 3 kids that i brought home leftovers of both the noodles and tofu . i tried the vegetables with fried noodles on my first trip for $ 7.25 . they were just okay . even though the noodles are being made right there and you can watch through the window the taste was very similar to panda express to me . had three of the smoothies- watermelon , papaya and strawberrry- all with boba . the boba was pretty good but the smoothies were n't great . i prefer boba house around the corner in the same shopping center . i do n't think i will be back .
0	great space . came to pick up my bib for the r & r marathon . stopped at tortilla 's mexican food inside and it was delicious ! chicken taco plate was pretty good !
0	the manager , a man , was very kind . the staff could not accommodate a simple v design for my nails saying they could only do it in gel . that it would take too much time ... after i had already made an appointment and was 30 min early . the nail tech did n't speak to me at all . very cold and aluff feeling . the work was good , but i asked on the phone to have nail art . not impressed at all ! not happy at all . i was referred to bond first , and i should have gone there .
0	my recent fresh spring roll craving was fully satisfied . thank saigon noodles for existing in madison . for entree , i ordered stir fried rice noodles with beef in their `` house sauce '' - ok , the sauce was just hoisin sauce and not much of anything else . my friend 's pho tasted pretty good except the noodles was slightly over cooked . overall , not a bad place to come for a quick vietnamese fix . sorry for the bland review , but it was one those places . except , of course , the spring roll .
1	everything about this place was awesome . friendly service , no wait , and good atmosphere . our waiter had great timing , did n't rush us . i had this amazing cucumber martini that i wish i could get back home . two of us got a spicy seafood risotto that was perfect tasting and portioned . the others got pasta , all loved them . and two of us got starter salads with pear and gorgonzola that were superb . they were huge too . went great with the cucumber martini .
1	got so excited when my husband said we could come again after church today ! we ordered chile rellenos , gauc dip , chicken taco , enchilada , beef taco , tostada with guac , and some other stuff , but the main point is everything is good ! this was my second trip and we loved it ; )
0	the shrimp taco is to-die-for . spicy with a hint of cilantro and the crunch of cabbage and good sized prawns .
0	here 100+/year . hellhole . overcrowded , and not one but two police killings inside gate areas ( passed tsa ) in recent years . sunburnt rednecks abound . post-security dining options dismal ; gate areas too small for current traffic .
1	despite a notable reduction in staff from my first visit , i am pleased to note a considerable improvement in taste and timeliness since my first visit to down south late last year . take note however that the regional truism to the effect that one should not be in a hurry when one goes down south applies here as well , only more so . thankfully , norm r and i were not in a hurry , and we both felt the food was worth the 27 minute wait from ordering to delivery of first dish to table , with all others following in reasonable succession afterward ( as opposed to the 90 minutes on the first visit ) . on this visit down south got `` fried '' right on all accounts . the chicken that was `` pretty '' but flavorless on visit one , was perfectly seasoned and delicious on this try . the first visit 's bitter collard greens were a mess - while these were a proper mess ( batch ) of collards , well-complimented with a dash of hot-pepper vinegar , as opposed being a necessary disguise to the first . the two fried pork chops , decent sized and battered with breading of similar seasoning to the chicken , were moist and delicious . the mac n cheese , the only standout ( aside from the 7-up cake ) of the first visit , was the creamy , cheesy , comfortingly delicious equal to that of the first . the experimental side of the night was the fried corn on the cob with same breading/batter , and to my surprise delicious and not remotely greasy . there was a sizeable biscuit included with the meal , but with no butter , no jam , honey , or anything supplied to go with it , not a worthwhile inclusion . we were welcomed on entry by the owner and told we could take our choice of seats and chose one of the large , deep , comfortable booths . the owner checked with us a couple of times before we decided on our orders , took the orders and supplied us with our respective beverages . there were far fewer folks working , and things frankly seemed to working far more efficiently without so many people and so much conversation among staff . the owner , who served as our greeter , waiter , server , and cashier , was friendly and solicitous of our opinion on the food and appreciative of our compliments . service was adequate if not exactly attentive in the nearly empty restaurant , as our glasses ran dry for extended periods , but can be excused somewhat given the range of activities having to be covered by the one individual . all in all , i 'm glad i made the effort to go back down south . the food on this visit was delicious in flavor , generous in quantity , the service improved , and the overall experience satisfying and economical ( even aside from the coupon deal ) . we would both go back and would encourage you to go down south too - as long as you 're not in a hurry . note the $ 15 `` gospel brunch '' on at least one sunday a month where you can presumably get your soul food and eat it too .
0	i came here to have a meeting and i could n't believe how difficult it was too find . it sure would be nice to have a sign that faces the street , but that 's probably too `` commercial '' for this place . the tiny parking lot was full so i had to park a couple blocks down the street and walk ; not a huge deal . the inside was soooo loud and the music was blaring ; i could n't believe this was a coffee shop . to be fair i did not taste any food or their coffee , so i 'm sure there is room for improvement and i thought the outside space was quaint . i will come here again with my friend who swears by this place and give the food and drink a try . this places seems like more of a cool place to be seen then a coffee shop ; i could n't imagine trying to get any work done .
1	the best non-brick-oven style pizza in pittsburgh . this is the only place i would recommend picking up a single slice from . the slice has a thin crust but is sturdy enough to fold the slice in half . the tomato sauce is flavorful . the cheese is uncompromised . and the slices come out hot and quick ! i was literally in and out within 45 seconds during my last stop .
0	my first experience here was about 7 years ago and minus the fact that on the way out i was witness to a murder ( yes , that actually happened . my date and i witnessed one man gun down another and run away . and yes we called 911 and yes we were called as witnesses at the trial but i digress ... ) i had a good time . seeing as how my last visit ended , i 'm sure no one would blame me for never returning . the only reason i recently visited again was a very close friend 's party . i 'm very happy my 2nd experience here ended on a much better note than the first . there are better bowling alleys outside of the city-i recommend going to one of them .
0	it is a shame that i have to give an irish pub one star , but after my last experience here i will never go back . i met a friend out one night for the typical laid back night of drinking which ultimately ended up turning into a long night of drinking and socializing . the only problem was that when we i got the bill there were tons of drinks on it that were not ours . we had been sitting on the patio and anyone that we would talk with who randomly stopped by our table and ordered a drink , we would end up with the drink on our tab . we also had another friend stop by and get drinks and we actually watched him pay his tab , but there his drinks were at the end of the night . this service was horrible . the waitress was n't willing to do anything about this to help us . our bill ended up being nearly $ 300 ! ! ! granted about 200 of it was ours between food and our drinks , but they were never able to explain the other drinks on our bill . the next day i called the manager and he stated he would take a look at it and get back to me . he never did . i ended up eating the cost on this one and just chalking it up to a place that i 'll never return to . this happened a while back but since i am new to yelp , this experience was so terrible that i could n't not give this place a review . i have to imagine that this has happened to several other people . i hope if you do make the poor decision to go to this place that you double and triple check your tabs . there are so many better places to have a good time in downtown chandler stay away from this place .
0	it is just ok. i 'm not a local so i was hoping to find a place off the strip on my visit to vegas . the reviews appear to be promising but unfortunately the service and quality of the food was not the best . the restaurant is within a small hotel that does need some renovation . lobby is quiet and after leaving the cosmopolitan my first impression was that it was dead . any other place in the usa i probably would n't have noticed . the actual decor is nice and in good taste . the place is tiny so i do recommend making reservations . the hostess did offer outside or inside seating . i recommend inside since the outside is a simply patio and the decor of the inside is nicer . wait staff . although they were nice an accommodating , it did take awhile ( 15 min ) to get our drinks and some bread . speaking of bread , i would have appreciated a heads up that the bread has bacon in it . i do my best not to each pork/beef etc so that was n't cool . the waiter really pushed hard for the special after i came thinking the scallops might be a good choice . not sure if that was because of the quality or what but he made it clear not to order the scallops . the food was just 'ok '' . the octopus , slight over cooked . they also gave me a huge piece that needed to be cut , not knife so left that on the plate . foie gras - not cooked enough , cold . made the fat taste like fat . foie gras can be delicious and this time it tasted like fat . the special and halibut were tasty but not worth ever coming back . the only good thing was the barrymore drink . that was good . overall not really impressed . to bad , i would have like to have had a great meal .
0	i went there for breakfast and was early enough to avoid the lines . when i was seated the server asked me what i wanted to drink . when i asked for a latte it was like i was speaking another language . i settled for their coffee . the layout of the food is bizarre . there is a station for toast but the jam is on the other side of the room . if you want cereal and milk , you can help yourself to the cereal but have to ask hour server to get you some milk . they had smoked salmon and nearby was a bowl labeled whipped cream cheese . it turned out to be whipped cream , a little sweet for the salmon . there was a lot to choose from and none of it looked or tasted very good .
1	have had several tattoos done at staytrue by jason murphy . he is friendly and professional . i could n't be happier with his work . i have a ton of tattoos all over my body some more than 30 years old and from great artists around the country and i always recommend jason locally . there is a reason he sometimes has a waiting list , just like a good restaurant requires reservations . just check out his website to see his work .
0	bartender on wednesday night total a $ $ . 3 times i had to ask what beer they have on tap after he gave me a menu that does n't list what beer they have and then gave me an attitude moron should be fired . i will never go there again and will bad mouth to everyone i know
0	i 'm not to sure what the big deal is about this place . i was staying at the hgi up the street and so i moseyed into this place for some barbecue . i decided to have some ribs and beer so i rolled up my sleeves and got to work . unfortunately , that 's what the ribs were ... work . they ribs were no where near fall-off-the-bone . the beer was perfectly cold but the ribs were forgettable . i knew i should have ordered the chicken fried chicken . ah , well . next time .
0	if you 're a black male do n't go to bar charlotte , they are racist . i was denied entry on 12/21/12 . the door man , said i was denied entry because of my boots.on the website it says that the dress code was no construction boots , which i clearly had on aldo boots . i am a successful , preppy looking black guy . this has never happened to me before at any other club downtown.i cant believe people are still bigots and its about be 2013 : cc
0	full disclosure , i am from the southern part of the united states . fortunately i have been to plenty of restaurants named `` smoke stack '' in my life . the expectation i have is that the food would have some beautiful smokey flavour . unfortunately this place does not meet that expectation . the location and atmosphere are great , which is the only thing saving this place from a 1 star . the price is high for what you 're getting . i got the ribs , which had never come close to a grill or smoker . they seems to have been boiled in too much sauce , and reminded me of the mcrib . my wife got the prawn and avocado salad . prawns were completely unseasoned and the avocado was a wee bit past it 's prime . the highlight was the elderflower martini . one last thing i would like to add ... for the love of god take the bloody mary off the menu . that was a joke in poor taste to the wonderful drink that has saved me from many a hangovers . i believe it has cranberry juice in it . disgusting .
0	i do n't tend to give restaurants bad reviews but this time i had no option . here is a little background on a recent experience we had at copper . a cousin of mine graduated from college this past weekend and we decided to go to copper 's sister restaurant blue taj for dinner . i have had food from blue taj before and the type of food they serve was perfect for the group of people that were going to dinner . when we called to make reservations we spoke to the owner who said they had no room available for our large party but copper his other restaurant copper could accommodate us . he said the restaurants were the same and said he would make a reservation for us there . we agreed and thought nothing of it . i have heard from a few people regarding copper and they had said the food was good there so i decided to do no further research . after graduation we arrived at the restaurant and within minutes i realized this might not have been a good idea . the concept of copper is not the same as blue taj . anyone would tell that from the menu and the ambiance . considering we had a large number of vegetarians with us the menu was lacking on those options . we had already sat down and ordered drinks so there was no other option for us . the portions at copper are small and not worth the price they were charging . the type of india restaurant i was expecting was one where we could all share different dishes but that definitely is not the way copper is set up . the food here is what you would call modern indian food and not traditional . that was why it was really hard for me to find dishes for my family who are used to the traditional dishes that are served at most indian restaurants . the one dish that was very well executed was the lamb meatballs . it was cooked perfectly and the sauce it was served in was delicious . on the opposite in the chicken appetizer and the shrimp appetizer were horrible . the chicken was extremely bland and and not well executed . as far as the shrimp is concerned if i 'm paying almost $ 15.00 for a dish i expect more then 4 small pieces of shrimp with no flavor . the dinner portions were bigger but should not carry an average price tag of $ 20 a dish . if this restaurant was well executed i know i would enjoy it . i enjoy new age indian food and do n't mind splurging ever now and then but it has to be worth it . this place was not . and the fact that we were told it was the same as blue taj was a huge blunder on management 's part this is not a place you should take everyone for a large family dinner . this is a place for smaller groups and corporate dining . the service and ambiance is nice but again because of the food and confusion i ca n't give it more than 2 stars .
1	i 've lost count on how many times i went to pho dau bo in here . not only their pho and vermicelli are tasty , their drinks are wonderful as well . try their ch\u00c8 ba m\u00c0u - 3 kinds of bean pudding , and specialty pho , and friend chicken vermicelli . they are awesome !
1	the waitstaff was so refreshingly different from your normal overly pleasant servers . green was our waiter and everytime i ask him for a suggestion or recommendation he immediately answered , matter of factly with a menu choice . almost my entire meal was what he recommend and the food was outstanding ! the quality is exactly what anyone would hope for and the flavor combinations were absolutely delicious . i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that 's in the mood for delicious pizza . trust me , go here !
0	gallo blanco makes me a saaaaaaaaaaaaaad panda . seriously whats up , dude ? the service lately has been pretty crappy . way disappointed . i keep hoping it 's an off night but that 's turned into a pattern so i ca n't excuse it any longer . the food is still good , but it takes forever . and the worst part , the last two times i ordered cochinita tacos they were dry and one was just grissle . what the heck are yall doin back there ? i want the old gallo back .
0	i used to really enjoy getting takeout from this location . lately the store has become a little rundown and the service ( especially when ordering over the phone ) is really lacking , to the point of being rude .
0	the fish is above average , not great . the hush puppies however are amazing . they have a nice selection of sauces to choose from and premium beers are only $ 3.25 !
1	not a bad hotel . it 's nice and clean and quiet ! ! ! i wish they had more breakfast selections , but that 's the only downside . and it 's about 2 blocks off the strip , so not a bad location of your looking for a cheaper and quieter experience !
0	i went to the original hofbrauhaus in europe and thought it was a giant tourist trap ... well it 's even more of a tourist trap here ! let 's play the adjective game : oom-pah filled kitschy super-loud brown creamy sauce-y ( have to make it an adjective ) wtf ... what 's going on with those spankings ? ( not an adjective ) ok , so i 'm experiencing a classic vegas moment of cognitive dissonance ... something i know ( and do n't quite love ) from europe has been transported via the starship enterprise to be adjacent to my hotel in vegas . i can see how this place could be fun , but really ? is there where you come in vegas ? the food : food is standard german fare , and it was acceptable but nothing special . sausages , spaetlzle , sauerkraut , big cuts of meat in brown creamy sauce . it 's served promptly and without any circumstance . the beer : well , they have the basic hofbrauhaus beers : light , dark , a few seasonals . prices top actual oktoberfest prices by quite a bit ... they even make canada and nyc seem cheap . the germans are not imaginative with their beer styles , but what they do , they do well . the atmosphere : loud ! it 's this strange super-new looking version of what is a very old establishment in germany . they have an oom-pah band going which they seem to have imported , however , they 're quite hard to make out because the sound system is poor . the crowd is a little bit rowdy . you even see some real germans there , well , because they like to eat german food when they travel . the weird : whack ! is that middle-aged , fat business man being spanked by the waitress ? wtf ? they have this uber-strange practice here , in which a busty `` shot girl '' comes over , sells you a shot , and gives you a very loud whack with a wooden paddle . this is apparently their las vegas twist on the hofbrauhaus ... super strange ! this is not a german tradition , in any way , shape , or form . it was kind of creepy seeing groups of drunken middle-aged men bending over to get spanked in public . they even sell t-shirts that announce `` i 've been spanked at the hofbrauhaus '' ok , so i can see how this is something you might enjoy , but i , for one , can certainly skip it .
0	i used a groupon for a swedish massage and facial . i could probably sum up the experience with a white people problems meme : `` went to the day spa '' insert white whine photo here `` overcome with ennui '' the ambiance is not very aesthetically appealing for a full service day spa . it 's a bit choppy and disjointed ; the bulk of the space being used as a hair salon with no locker/changing area or real relaxation area , so you get to drudge your bulky belongings around as you proceed from one treatment to the next . glad i had a groupon . i think most of the aestheticians , massage therapists , etc . who work there are independent contractors on call ( not positive about that ) and there 's a certain overall disconnectedness that permeates this place . no robe or slippers there , had to be found , clanging hvac system , no music , cd 's taken by previous therapist ; all just enough to detract from that `` calgon , take me away '' feeling . glad i had a groupon . my massage was ok. my facial by suzan was excellent . glad i had a groupon .
1	i did n't stay at bally 's so i ca n't comment on the rooms but i did spend a good deal of time in their casino . my favorite casino on the strip . why ? because they are who they are and they 're not trying to be something they 're not . they 're not shiny or new . the cosmopolitan this is not . the waitresses are a bit rough around the edges and look like they probably work a second shift at some seedy dive bar off the strip . they ca n't pull off the tight revealing uniforms that you see the much younger girls wearing at the newer casinos . and that 's ok , well at least for me it is . i do n't care what you look like as long as you keep the ( free ) drinks coming . i went here early one day , maybe around 11am and our waitress was so on the ball . she 'd plomp a drink down in front of me and be back in less than 5 minutes to ask if i needed another one . my drink was as full as when she left it but got ta love that initiative ! another biggie is that they 're one of the few casinos that do $ 10 minimums as opposed to $ 15 . this can make a huge difference . also , wut up to michelle at the roulette table . she was awesome and i had the quintessential beginner 's luck gambling experience at her table . i think i had at least a 20+ win streak going on and it was the best time ever . my first time ever gambling in vegas and i walked with $ 240 that night . not bad for a rookie .
0	we ate dinner for thanksgiving . the lights were so dim that we had to use the our phones to read the menu . food portions were large . the server clained it serving size is for 1-2. she was absolutely wrong ... was enough for 4-5 folks . bottom line is that we had ordered a lot of food based on her recommendation . the server looked like she was high or just a ditz !
0	typical wal-mart supercenter , but the smallest parking lot for one that i 've seen . it is very new and very clean and has all the usual stuff that sc 's have - a subway , tire and lube , etc . one thing to note is that the signage on sc-160 is minimal . you have to know where this place is or you wo n't find it . i drove right past the turn the last time !
1	very friendly staff ! they were quite attentive to my little one 's requests , and did n't ignore her questions . decor is really cool - i liked all the classic rock posters and memorabilia . ice cream was delicious ; especially when eaten outside on their front patio . it 's a great place to check out when you are in aspinwall , and i highly recommend it !
0	sad to say , this place is going down hill . hard to believe an italian restaurant that does n't offer penne or bow tie pasta . also their prices have gone up , like they were n't already high enough . hope they wake up before it 's too late .
0	this place is a health scam of the worst kind ! what makes high fructose corn syrup unhealthy and unsuperior to `` real sugar '' ? the fructose . this is why we hate hfcs and avoid it and shun it for the unhealthy substance that it is . it 's curious that the general public is so gullible that they believe a substance made of 100 % fructose is healthier for us than a substance that is 60 % fructose/40 % glucose . http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crystalline_fructose this crystalline fructose they use is still a chemical and far , far worse for you than table sugar ( 50 % glucose , 50 % fructose ) . `` as of january 2010 , the fda has not designated crystalline fructose to be generally recognized as safe . '' `` any positive health benefit of crystalline fructose consumption is fueled primarily by the fact that fructose does have the same value as glucose when burned . however , fructose is processed by the body differently ; fructose 's causal relationship to hyperlipidemia , fatty liver disease , cirrhosis , coronary arterial disease and obesity remain a concern for public health analysts '' . personally i avoid all hfcs anyways , but the idea that a product higher in fructose is better for you is nothing but a scam . protect your health and avoid products the fda does not recognize a safe ! !
0	i recently went for a pedicure and manicure . while using a cheese grater type device on my feet , the technician cut my toe . this was while her head was turned talking to a customer near the door . i required urgent care attention with shots and medication . i was in pain for over a week and could only wear sandals . follow-up with the owner has been of no use . would love to give 0 stars .
0	this restaurant seemed a little clustered with many different things . first you have the bakery , and then you have the seating area for brunch . now i was highly disappointed with the service , overall i felt i had to wait a little longer than you usually should . first off , i do n't think any restaurant should have a seat yourself option . unless you are ordering from the cashier service yourself and then seating yourself , this should never ever be an option . it took about 20 minutes for our server to come and get our order , and it took another 30 mins for our food to come . so overall , almost an hour to actually eat and order which is something i do n't find lightly . i think the girl near the bakery section felt bad for us so she came and got our order , which i found nice of her . aside from the clustered and noisy ambience , the food was ok. my boyfriend and i ordered the crab eggs benedict , french toast , and the biscuits and gravy with a side of eggs and sausage . the crabs benedict was good , i think i got way too much meat i did n't even find the bread at the bottom of it . the flavors were all there though . i was n't too fond of the potatoes , i thought it was mushy and to weird of a spice for me . the french toast was good , a little thick cut and huge but i understand the big serving idea . i think i needed a little more syrup instead of the small side they gave me . the bread was really thick , i think more syrupy sweets would do it justice . the biscuits and gravy was ok , personally i thought it was too light . i actually like the biscuits and gravy from south point which is rather odd . but i thought they had more flavor . overall this place was ok , i do n't think i 'll be returning soon because of that clustered feeling . on top of that i paid $ 43.00 for everything which i thought was little too pricey . i could 've gone to egg works and paid less than that , but hey that 's just me .
0	chicken noodle soup was very salty ! rinaldi 's needs to find a better way to secure the lids and/or provide the employees with rubber bands so that the lid is secure when you are taking it to go . sadly , my soup went all over my car because the lid was not tight enough . the egg salad sandwich was delicious but was served rather messy when it was cut in half . i would only recommend rinaldi 's if you are really hungry and do n't feel like going to a subway .
1	by far the best happy hour deal in all of phoenix ... free burgers , chips and salsa and 1/2 price beer !
1	this is a very nice market . their produce is generally very good , and if you ask they will usually cut something open and let you try it . they have bulk spices , allowing you to get as much or as little as you need . same for their bulk grains and nuts . their store brand salsa is better than any national brand i can think of . their store brand chips are also very good ( better than most national brands ) . their meat counter is small , but features all the basics plus a few specialty items . and many of these meats are `` no hormones , no antibiotics '' products . oh ... and on wednesdays they honor both the previous week 's ad and the new week 's ad . we come here almost every week ( often on wednesday ! ) . it 's a very good market .
1	this is my favorite place to pick up bread . i love that it is in the atwater market , it makes my shopping easy . i usually get the flax , or other loafs of bread on a weekly basis . their other products are all good . great bakery !
0	the banana fosters pancakes are a decadent dessert for breakfast . when we travel we like to spoil ourselves and go out to breakfast . the breakfast club is a fun place with an 80s vibe . it has outdoor seating and is dog friendly . which is one of the main reasons why we go because our little pup can join us . there 's an extensive breakfast menu and full coffee bar to choose from . my husband had the huevos ranchero , which he loved . the banana fosters pancakes were good - but you have to be in the mood for sweet and indulgent . it 's topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . i have also had the challah french toast . it was too sweet and rich for me but i know it 's would be a favorite amongst the kids . it 's a place that we 'll revisit again .
0	visited this joint over the summer and three stars is being generous . very strange menu , spotty service . poutine was nasty . we were the only people in there yet our waitress went to take a smoke break so we sat there waiting for her to return so we could get our check and get out of there . they had some weird nature program on the tv with a guy skinning a snake which seemed to go well with their odd burger menu . that seemed to be about the only animal that was missing from it .. would not recommend this place unless you 're a starving carnivore .
1	do n't let the theme-park like location fool you , this restaurant is serious cuisine for serious foodies . the atmosphere is elegant , yet lively , with art-deco inspired fixtures and furnishings complementing a spectacular view of the strip . the staff is warm and attentive , without being intrusive . and , the menu ... an absolute delight . you can choose from chef joho 's exquisite seven course signature tasting menu or extensive a la carte selection . i highly recommend the warm lobster salad with garlic braised artichokes . a superb blend of flavors and textures . the roast rack of lamb is also quite wonderful . cooked to perfection with a crisp herb crust drizzled with a tarragon jus . make sure you save room for dessert . the souffl\u00e9s are not to be missed .... i recommend either the pistachio or grand marnier ..... and the raspberry napoleon is splendid . also , do n't be surprised if you 're visited by the eiffel tower 's manager , laurent ertle , during your dining experience . he works to make sure that every guest is treated with exceptional care . i 've now been to the restaurant about a half-dozen times and each experience has been marvelous and memorable . one final note , prices are what you would expect from a fine restaurant , but they are realistic , not inflated , and the value is outstanding .
0	i like sloan it has a large jewelery section - it 's great for gifts and myself . they have a lot of itemy pieces- unfortunately i purchased a necklace here in february for my sister and she wore it once and the next time she went to put it on it broke in her hands for $ 55 i would have at least wanted her to wear it a few more times : ( other than that though its a nice boutique they gift wrap for you at no charge and they always seem to be having a sale of some kind- definitely worth a peek
1	the good : 1. one of , if not the most aesthetically great looking ballparks in the country with beautiful mountain views . 2. excellent food options such as asian , mexican , and your typical `` ballpark '' fare . i highly recommend the crust pizza a local pizzeria who have a stand here . 3. tons of parking and shuttle service to and from old town scottsdale . 4. intimate feel 5. casino nearby for post game entertainment . 6. there are no bad seats in the house . 7. it is quite literally the disneyland of baseball with easy access to practice fields and players . 8. free sun tan lotion . 9. the facility has 3 party decks . ( pepsi patio , coors and miller decks ) 10. local favorite and former d-back luis gonzalez is usually here and hangs out with the fans . 11. has more intimacy than chase field , the d-backs regular season home . the bad : 1. lack of vegetarian foods . 2. feels like a regular season stadium with regards to the size of the building and the prices . 3. it can be a long walk from the parking lots to the stadium unless you manage to park very close . 4. unlike other spring training parks outside food is not allowed .
0	placed an order for deliver about 1.5hrs ago . lady said it will be 40 min . ok i get even 50 min but hell ... why pay extra for delivery . little upsetting . maybe if its backed up tell customer you 're busy it could be up to 2hrs ?
1	i guess the promoters there actually made my first experience here better ... we skipped the long line as we got brought in , first floor was kinda empty for a friday night , second floor was packed . music there was n't great but did n't bum me out either . we had a few drinks then my friend complained there were n't enough asian ( seriously ... ) and that 's when we left . wish i could stay longer ! but overall i had a good time there .
1	over all great food and drinks . waitress are nice which is a plus !
1	this is where i came to see lorreta lynn on saturday night and although the area is incredibly scary ( we are talking do n't make eye contact/lock your doors scary ) once inside you can forget that . you can get a patron margarita for $ 10 ! ! ! not the best selection of what i like to call adult video games ( slots ) but they have enough to keep you occupied . on saturday if you had a card for the hotel , frequent customer , as long as it was in a machine you had the chance to win $ 500 ! cool deal . the biggest plus for me about this place was the people , everyone was nice . a huge relief and change from the strip where you are a barcode of a person .
0	now please let me start by saying that my time is valuable to me , so i am going to spend the next couple of minutes writing this review as a warning to others that might be thinking of visiting this establishment . i put one star for many reasons . 1. because yelp wo n't allow you to write a review with no stars . 2. because i have been going to gallagher 's around phoenix for years . 3. the food at this location was terrible for 3 out of the four guests . 4. the staff overall was anti customer service . management being the worst . 5. the smell outside as you walk in the door . so let me explain 3 - 5 , i would try and explain 1 and 2 but i think they are self explanatory . 3. the food . i/2 rack of ribs with two sides . the ribs came out looking way over baked with no moisture to speak of extremely dry and void of flavor . asked for extra sauce just to get some flavor and moisture into the meal . the two side were asparagus which was actually very , very good , and sweet potato fries which were rubbery and again very under seasoned . bad meal # 1. honey mustard wings and a greek salad were the choice of our second guest , and my wife . the wings were so bad that my wife questioned their freshness had kind of a pungent sour smell , when we asked our server ( who by the way tried to be helpful but seemed very overwhelmed ) she was told by the manager that it was the smoke that made them taste and smell that way . i have eaten smoked chocked on many occasions and this was to that , nor that smell . i did not try the greek salad but my wife stated the the dressing had way to much vinegar and was not that good . she only ate one wing and i ate one wing to confirm the foul taste . bad meal # 2. the third member of our party actually liked his scoville burger . he liked the flavor however thought it would be a little hotter considering is name . good meal # 1. now finally for the forth and final member of our party . me . i had the mild wings and again they had the same pungent sour odor and what i did eat tasted like it had a little more bbq sauce on it than mild wing sauce . after the wings i did not order anything else . bad meal # 3. the staff . when we were greeted our server was very nice , and she asked if we wanted something to drink and if we were ready to order which we were . we ordered our drinks the meals above also asking for the ntn game consoles so we could play the ntn trivia . she took if order and was very nice . our next encounter was with a different waitress who brought our food and seemed very bothered that she had to do so but again our server was nice . now mind you this is about 30 minutes later and we asked for the ntn game consoles again . 20 minutes later she brought them out . by now we have determined that the food was terrible and that someone should call the health department about it seeming to be spoiled , but we decided to just hang out and play trivia as a group for a while before heading home . this is where we discuss the poor management . just as we start playing trivia the manager comes up and changes the trivia from the tv that was displaying it . when we asked our server she stated that she would ask for it to be changed back . when she returned we were told that we could turn around and see the tv behind us if we wanted to play trivia . i asked to speak to the manger and she got him for us . i told this person that we were playing trivia on this display and that we would like it changed back to trivia so we could continue . his response was that the table of guest sitting directly below the display wanted it changed to the re-broadcast of the game form last night . please note that i earlier stated the table of guests sitting directly below the display . really only two of the people at the table could watch the game . the others would have to look straight up and slightly behind them to see the tv . the manager then said he would try and find us another tv to use . once he realized his mistake he went over to the table under the display and talked to them and returned the tv to is original channel displaying the trivia game . however i am not sure what he said to the table under the display but they continued to give us nasty looks and make snyder remarks under their skin which made us all a little uncomfortable . we informed our server that we were going to be leaving after all and explained why and she then informed us that the group under the display were friends of the managers and that they were always acting t like they owned the place and were also very rude in regards to other customers . it is my suggestion to avoid this establishment at all cost . try bull shooters down the road , or oune of the other sports bars on the immediate area .
0	i wanted to order a cake for my son first birthday . i went to the store , as i like the cake designs on their website . i did n't ordered right away but got four cupcakes to go : chocolate , vanilla , lemon and red velvet .the lady told me those were basically same as the ( some of the ) cake flavors . i am sad to say they were : dry , very dry , so dry and super dry : ( and i went in the morning ! after that i decided not to order from them . maybe it was a fluke but that 's not good when you 're trying to sell cakes : -s my rating is based on the cakes/cupcakes .
1	good stuff sushi , fresh and fast !
0	very average - my pasta was cold , the steaks were ok but very small but the service was what really let it down.the waiter was exasperated by simple questions and when one of our party did n't get a bread roll ( as they had no side plate ) and requested one it was unceremoniously dumped on the table , minus a plate.i wo n't be back .
0	pretty good food and really good beer but service was not the best . got the wrong order and it was not corrected . also waited a really long time with an empty beer for the check .
0	tgif is always my last resort kind of place . the food is meh ... you get what you order and its obviously cooked by someone who 's not a cook . the drinks are standard giving this place nothing special . food quality below average to average . the service is slow and inacurrate . it never seems like they care about you giving service quality poor . the price is average . not much to say about the price because it 's mostly cheep , but so is the food . value below average to average . over all there 's not much to say about tgif . definitely not worth going out of your way for or visiting when phoenix has so much to offer . my advice to tgif ... do something big and unique and train your staff .
1	breakfast was great ! ordered the western omelet , the eggs were so fluffy and the hash brown was crispy to perfection . the best experience of coming here was the atmosphere and the serve . the owner greets u at the door and is so friendly . a definite place to visit when were in town . do n't forget to order the cinnamon roll and biscuit and gravy , a must have ! ! !
0	when i picked up at phoenix the service was good . it was quick but nobody did a walk thru with me . upon looking at the car i notice several scratches all over the rear of the car . once i reached my destination i noticed several scratches underneath the front of the car that were hard to see at first . i immediately called and the lady on the phone was helpful and made a note . upon dropping off at the airport the staff was rude ! by the way the car was given to me without a full tank of gas even though they told me it was full . the seats were filthy ! stains everywhere . it was gross . then they accused me of doing everything . i will never rent from fox again .
1	this is going to be a simple update . i still love the crepes so i 'm keeping my rating the same . finally tried their chai though . they make them with honey so it really changes the taste . makes them way sweeter than spicy . trying that once was enough . i want spicy .
0	i was not a big fan of renegade canteen . bacon wrap shrimp stuffed with cheese and jalapenos over grits was good but that is where the good flavors ended . the risotto in the short rib over 'creamy ' risotto was more like short rib over wet soupy undercooked rice . the sauce on the flank stake hit only one note and the steak was a bit tough , even for the cut . pork osso bucco was very bland . i grinded some salt from the grinder on the table into the dish and it elevated the dish about 2 starts . simple things like seasoning could have gone a long way . i passed on dessert .
0	2 stars and that 's me being a little generous . we arrived here after lunch with friends that are also yelpers . i 'm not going to speak for them , but in my opinion , ice monster has some work to do . ice monster cafe is new and a couple of hiccups are to be expected , right ? they 're new , clean , and a decent place to hang out at . however , what 's lacking is a knowledgeable staff and desserts that are worth the price that they have them at . i had their coffee ice cream , which is literally a small scoop of blue bunny ice cream . tasted good , but not worth the $ 5.95 price tag . the biggest disappointment is the overall service . my gf had a few questions about the items on their menu and the staff could n't even speak to it . they even stated that they could google some of the items on the menu for us . really ? google it ? ? i do n't expect a new business/staff to be experts , but at least have some knowledge of what you 're serving . a few of my friends had orders that either took too long ( ie . 20 minutes for boba ) or were just wrong ( i.e . coffee instead of tea ) . overall , not a fan , not as good as it gets , but giving them a break with an `` i 've had better '' only because they 're new . i 'm sure they will improve and i hope they do . i look forward to reading better rated reviews and i 'm willing to give them another go when that time comes . as for now , 2 stars are all they get from me . ps : the check-in offer reads `` 1 free purchase of 2 items '' . they 're speaking yoda and really mean `` buy 2 items and receive another 1 for free '' .
0	are you kidding me ? this very morning i walked over to this `` hidden treasure '' as i had found it a few weeks ago . i saw the fantastic baked goods and could n't wait to share with my friends ... i would n't spend a nickel here . rude rude rude . 10:20 this morning i was treating myself to breakfast and the little girl behind the counter was sweet . i spotted the menu and decided to use the table service the girl was bringing me a menu and a muffin ; as i 'm sitting the owners whipped husband comes to the table and tells me he needs the table for the lunch crowd . i said and lunch is when ? he says well you have a computer and you may stay for hours and i need this table .. so i proceed to another and that was the wrong table too . he wants me at a tiny table in the doorway in the sun . i asked if he was kidding , i had been in the hospitality industry and he was not acting hospitable . the little girl is trying to hand me the plate with the muffin and i 'm telling her it is okay please wrap it to go ... i 'm not wanted here . the queen bitch sitting in the wing back chair with her strap on under her apron in case the husband acts up .. pipes up to tell me that i do not need to buy the muffin - i told her she was absolutely right and walked out .
0	had lunch here today ... the tables in the sun = super fantastic ... waiting 10mins to order at the bar = not so fantastic ... waiting what felt like ages to get food = really not so fantastic ... as it made me very rather late back to work ... a great place for a leisurely lunch and a couple of drinks in the sun ... should really have thought through restaurant choice on a one hour lunch break ... my chilli dog was tasty and the chips were thick cut , crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside ... = win ! ! look forward to heading back after work one evening maybe when i can properly enjoy the outdoor seating ! !
0	this place used to be a great spot for a quick meal , or an option when the weather is bad outside , because they are never busy you could get in and out . however the last two times i 've went down there i have stood at the grill station for a few mins and ignored by the 2 guys back there . i 've left and went somewhere else . it 's a shame that even when a place is so dead they do n't want to wait on you . the food was always `` ok '' at best but now with the poor service twice in a row i wo n't be back .
0	terrible , terrible , terrible ! beware of hidden fees , slow movers , and thieves . my credit card was stolen during my moved and used at a gas station miles away from my new house . when i made the appointment , i was not told of additional fees for stairs or that the company only accepted cash . the two men barely spoke english . stay away , i would rather move myself than use this company .
0	this place was so packed ! ! ! wall to wall tables ! ! ! great service ! but if you step out of your booth , you might get ran over by a server ! ! ! over all , the food and drink was good ! ! ! coconut prawns were awesome !
0	as with the all the ghost tours around edinburgh , its always more fun if you succumb to the advertisement 's hype and let your imagination run wild . deciding it would be fun to take my girlfriend on the tour i expected my hand to be squeezed in fear , to be clung on to in desperation as she quivered at the thought of the ghouls an frights that lay ahead . unfortunately the more informative ( compared to an entertainingly frightful ) style of the tour resulted in a weak hand grip and a fairly relaxed pulse rate . there was a little too much information with regards to the history of the sights visited and not enough focus on the scary stuff . indeed , it may just have been the tour guide we had that night or it may well have been that the tour bruised my macho image ... but at \u00a38.50 it will have to be a one off .
0	the customer service at the avondale location is terrible ! lets start with the vet . we brought our puppies in for their shots and the vet was so rude ! she question why we got two puppies , where we got them and why did n't they have their shots ? then she preceded to lecture us on what a big responsibility it is to take care of one dog let alone two and that she does n't know how we are going to potty train two dogs . my husband and i are not stupid , we have grown up with dogs which our parents still have to this day , we know what it takes to take care of a dog . now lets talk about the receptionist . we had to listen to her life story while taking forever to get our payment and give us the next appt . we got a call when getting ready to head out for the next appt . telling us that they scheduled wrong and that they could n't see us at our appt and to reschedule . this happened to us three times . after the third time we decided it was time to find a new vet .
0	uggh . i wanted pho really bad , but theirs tastes like warm ramen broth with 4 little pieces of meat in it . got the fried spring rolls , too , and they charged $ 5-6 for four little rolls that were obviously prepackaged frozen spring rolls . i got ta stop trying out restaurants without checking yelp first , because everyone else is dead on . avoid this place unless you 're in the strip and absolutely have to have some vietnamese ( and do n't care too much about quality ) .
0	it blows me away how many times i hear people rave about this place but i am not a fan . not even a little bit . every time i have been there the sushi has been warm- gross . i have crowned this place the most over-rated spot in charlotte .
0	god i wanted to like this place . regardless of my experience , the place is georgeous ! please read my letter to the spa below . i sent the letter and had no reply for over a month . when i contacted them again to see if it was received , i got a short email saying `` sorry '' and that i should come back and try it again . if they had customer service , they would really have something . i had a spa appointment on february 19th , 2007. i was really excited about trying out the spa , since i almost chose the sanctuary as a vacation several years ago , but ultimately decided on canyon ranch . i was also excited because i was hoping to find a great spa to use on my frequent visits to scottsdale . a couple days before my appointment i called and found out there was a yoga class at noon . i decided to attend the class since my appointments did n't begin until 2pm . after yoga i went to shower and water barely dripped out of the spout . i dressed and later was informed by the spa staff that there was n't any water . many clients opted for the hot tub . i had planned on ordering lunch before my appointments , but instead spent an hour and a half waiting to see if the water would come back on so i could hurry and shower . the water came back 15 minutes before my appointment . unfortunately , there was n't any hot water . i proceeded because i did n't want my therapist to have to massage me dirty . now freezing , i sat in the freezing lounge . i went to my massage and although the massage room was warm , it took me a half hour to get warm enough to enjoy the experience . unfortunately , the second half of the massage consisted of the maintenance men yelling back and fourth as they continued to tackle water issues outside . my second appointment was uncomfortable because my stomach growled the entire time . i have to say , i almost did n't write this letter . when i travel to spas around the country i put the greatest priority on the actual services themselves . in this case my services were top notch . the aesthetician and massage therapist met my expectations . i also have to mention that the attendants in the spa were on top of every detail , water was always filled , bathrooms always clean and everything was in place . when i was leaving , an older woman asked me `` how was everything ? ' '' i explained my disappointment with the showers and she said understood . i also mentioned that the waiting area was so cold and she said that it is because they turn off the heat at night . ok , so why is n't the heat turned on in the morning ? it was almost 2pm and no heat ? leaving the facility , i did notice that the heat had finally been turned on . before i left i stopped by the bar hoping for a quick snack and the bartender took care of me with a hot chocolate made from scratch . i was finally warm . the bartender was my best experience . i own a small business and i think it is very important to hear from my clientele . like i said , i almost did n't write this letter because my treatments were wonderful . however , i ca n't help but imagine how nice it would have been to experience those very treatments after a hot shower , a good lunch in a warm lounge and without screaming repair men .
1	on a friday night with nothing else going on , we decided to try a new place in our quest to find the best pizza in phoenix . lamp is a little out of the way in north scottsdale , but it looked good . it was a little more crowded than i expected , and after 15 minutes or so , we were able to get a table . lamp is a mid sized venue with an upscale feel ( the area is fairly insulated from any normal working class neighborhoods ) , with a very open food preparation area , as wood-fired pizza restaurants tend to be . i went with the gem ( red pizza with sausage , pepperoni , ricotta , garlic , and oregano ) , and my friend had the geppetto ( white pizza with sausage , gorgonzola , and caramelized onion marmelade ) . according to the menu , all of their sausage comes from the fantastic de falco 's italian deli in south scottsdale . the crust was excellent , and i really liked my pie . often when i get pepperoni on a pizza , the flavor overwhelms all the other ingredients and completely ruins it ( i 'm reminded of the terrible pie i had at lgo ) . on this one , it was just right . the sauce was delicious as well . i tried the white pie , and i did n't like it as much . it was n't bad , but it just did n't seem that special . also tried the ricotta cheesecake for dessert , and it was delectable . i think i really like this concept of using ricotta instead of cream cheese . do n't get me wrong , i like a good chunky new york cheesecake , but i guess the italians do it better . my biggest complaint about lamp is the dining experience - the place does feel a bit cold and pretentious . it probably goes with the north scottsdale territory , but it lacks the welcoming air that phoenix 's smaller pizza restaurants enjoy .
0	fast at lunch time that 's for sure . i had a thin crust tomato and basil , skimpy on the basil and was n't that hot but i was starving so it sufficed . my client had the meat cravers pizza or something ilke that , she loved it . the side salad was pretty barren but the lettuce was very fresh so i did appreciate that . jose luis was a very attentive server .
0	i know not to expect much out of airport food but i was hoping for more out of this place . sadly it is slim pickings in this terminal so you have very few choices if you are hungry . the server was not very attentive , not good if you are in a rush . the menu is very very very small . the food was decent , but i have had much much better in other airports .
0	pizza marginal . many items were very overly salty . service was very slow . for me and my daughter to spend over $ 60 for a pizza and a salad on one visit , was ridiculous . rethink that $ $ price category folks .
1	jolaine gave me a cut , color and highlights . my hair has n't looked this good in years . she knew just how to shape it , and the colors were perfect .
1	margaritas to go ! come here grab your yard stick to-go and proceed to explore the rest of the vegas strip drink in hand !
0	mehhh ..... prices are too high and service is slow ( 20 minutes for a hot dog ! ) . would n't cross the street back home to eat at this place . but , if you are from chi and need something to bring you back home this may do the trick ( although it may be cheaper and faster to fly home ! ) .
0	we were scoping out the spiffy new cosmopolitan hotel when we passed by this very interesting looking restaurant . there were two `` to-go counters '' on either side of the entrance -- one said `` open : chinese food , '' the other `` open : mexican food . '' intrigued , we decided to see if we could get in for dinner on the spot and got lucky scoring the table of a no-show reserved party . vegas can be a gamble , but sometimes you do win ! as its name ( and exterior ! ) would suggest , china ( pronounced chee-na ) poblano is an experiment in mixing asian and latin cuisine . from dim sum to tacos to noodles with huitlacoche ( corn smut , apparently ) , this is where chinatown meets the mission . yes , i 'm sort of from san francisco . i give this place 5 stars for the decor ( and service , which was also very good ) . the outside that 's set up to look like a city street with cheap mexican and chinese eateries side by side is a front for a very swanky restaurant on the inside . bicycle wheels hanging from the ceiling , random asian and native american-looking knickknacks stacked upon the walls in artsy fartsy fashion , splashes of colorful paint ... i was in interior design heaven . great job on that . on the other hand , for the food and its value , i can only give three stars . it was delicious , but ridiculously overpriced . $ 12.88 for four pieces of har gao ? teeny tiny pieces too , like a third the size of the shrimp dumplings you can get at any authentic chinese restaurant . $ 15.88 for won ton noodle soup ? ? $ 15 for guacamole ? ! ? ! i get it that this is a trendy fusion restaurant and that the chef is famous , but come on now . ethnic street food in a fancy hotel in las vegas is still ethnic street food , which means it should be cheap . essentially , you are paying to dine in this very nicely and expensively decorated business venture . all things considered , it was a satisfying meal and i 'm glad i got to try this place . our party of six ordered about half the menu and doubled up on some dishes as well . clearly i was not buying dinner that evening ... i 'll save whatever money i bring back from vegas for my neighborhood taqueria , thank you .
1	hooray ! ! another new restaurant in dtlv . before i review this place , i need to apologize to the rest of our party for the service . yes , i admit that i was part of the reason why some of the people in our group did n't get 5 star service . heck , i did n't even get 5 star service . but i did get what i thought was a very attentive server . carina was very nice , gave her recommendations on what i should eat & drink , and even chatted up a storm with me . one thing i 've noticed about restaurants in las vegas , waitresses always like to chat and sometimes the conversations can get out control where service for everyone else suffers . while i got excellent service , the rest of our group did n't . for that , i apologize to terri r , alicia r , sugi , toni r , and merrick . wo n't happen again , i promise . as for the actual food , i thought it was pretty good and different . the items on the menu reminded me of a fusion type hash house without the huge portions . prices for the food are about average to what you find off the strip , but cheap considering you 're in tourist land . i had their fried chicken and waffles with sweet potato tater tots . i thought that this was flavorful with a bacon after taste . their sweet potato tater tots was something different and thought it was pretty good . i washed my meal down with water , the unicorn , and some old school olde english 800. ambiance is a solid 4 stars , maybe a 5 during the weekdays . we ate outside , which was great for people watching . the only issue with eating outside is the smell coming out of the sewer . my suggestion , try to eat inside if you can . it will be tighter , but at least you do n't get that horrendous sewer stench . for drinks , you can take advantage of their bar or backyard garden . the drinks , or lack there of , was a problem . park on fremont was not prepared for the amount of people for their first week that they ran out of a lot of drinks that were on their menu by 8 pm . hopefully , this gets fixed soon . overall , i give this place 4 stars even with all the hiccups . i 'm giving park on fremont a break mainly because this is just the first week they have been open . food/drinks : -fried chicken and waffles ( cap n crunch fried chicken with applewood and smoked bacon waffles ) : http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas ? select=gdrgpzfkvb96qtlx9iulag # ypmbv7kxicmectxn5f7p3q -the unicorn ( ketel one citron vodka , lemon juice , simple syrup-mint , ginger beer , and lemon wedge ) : http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas ? select=oyv1wrwbhcfkvtlxjmkv8q # cr5ftbdqdrnffqj1sp-6yg -olde english 800 ( 8-ball ) : http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas ? select=gdrgpzfkvb96qtlx9iulag # 0ce0o4i3lxdqxccefhuyvw ps : park on fremont needs to change their business hours that are posted on yelp . the hours are obviously wrong at the moment . and again , hopefully their beer stock improves .
0	while visiting from california we went to a few bars downtown and were pleased with all except acme . this was the absolute worst bar i have ever been to . it took forever to get a drink from the tool of a bartender . then some nasty chick with std 's written all over her was dancing on the bar next to our $ 5 bottled beers . my boyfriend and i decided to walk upstairs to get away from it all only to be stopped by what assumed to be a bouncer , whom was sitting on a couch . he told us females only upstairs though we saw males up there . later to be told by the bartender `` you have to have a vagina or act like you have a vagina '' . we left after one beer and went to saddleranch where we had an absolute blast .
0	i give this two stars for the actual dance - they 're extremely traditional in style and programming , and appeal greatly to the nutcracker fans out there . sharp , cutting edge , brilliant they ai n't and their dancers are competent but lack style or pzazz . if you like little girls in pink tutus , you 'll probably go see them . however , do not give them your contact details . they phone you again and again asking for money ( on top of the ticket price ) . last year , someone phoned and asked for a donation . i said i was busy . she said she 'd phone back and did , though not at the time we 'd agreed . i told her i had talked to my husband and we had agreed that , although we had allocated our budget for donations to local groups , we like to support the arts and so would like to donate something to their next auction . she told me that was fine , but would i give some money too ? i repeated that we had decided not to give money but would donate an item . was i sure ? yes . she then started saying how much money they needed . i cut her short and told her there was no money on offer . ok , i 'll pass that on to someone and they 'll contact you . i assume she was on commission . months passed . eventually i got a request in the mail for a donation - i fired off an email telling them they had never acknowledged our offer , let alone accepted or declined it . i got a phone call from someone saying oops , passed this to someone else , an email saying sorry ... i shrugged and decided to forget it , and them . then a couple of weeks ago , i got a call asking for money . i stopped him halfway through his spiel and told him i had asked not to be contacted again . a few days later , someone phoned me to ask what had been the issue , as she 'd got a garbled account . i told her the saga . strange , she said , it does n't say on your record here that you do n't want to be phoned ; i 'll amend that . after she hung up , i thought `` know what ? i do n't want ot be phoned or written to or emailed . i told them that last year . why do they have a record of me ? '' so i emailed and said do n't write or email or phone . remove me from your records . today i got a mailing from them . mebbe they think persistence and ignoring my requests will wear me down and i 'll start scattering them with largesse . what is actually happening is that i am now telling everyone and his aunt `` for god 's sake , do n't give them your contact details ''
1	love this place . great garlic fries and they are super fresh . pulled pork is awesome and the rueben is very tasty . some of the liquor prices are a little high but great atmosphere .
0	located inside aria right by the guest hotel elevators . it stands out against the darkness of the casino and is visually appealing with its bright lights and array of colorful sweets and pastries . me and the galpals decided to get breakfast here before heading to our cabana by the pool . the line was a little long , but that was mostly due to people standing around admiring all the colorful treats on display . you place your order at the counter and then wait for your number to be called to pick it up . i ordered the smoked salmon sandwich : cream cheese , hardboiled egg , sprouts , and red onion all on a baguette . yum-o ! the cost of the sandwich was $ 9.50 ... normal for vegas standards . seating is extremely limited so if you 're a big group expecting to find seats together , it 'd probably be easier to take it all back to your hotel room upstairs and eat there . luckily we found enough scattered seats so we could enjoy the food .
0	the food is just ok. the burgers are really salty & greasy . other than the salt , there is no flavor . the fries are salty too . on the plus side , the service is good . the employees walk by & ask you how is everything .
0	some girlfriends and i went here to find shoes for our friend 's wedding . there was a wide selection and we were able to find shoes we liked . yes the shoes were cheap , which means lower quality , but what the heck do you expect , they are $ 9.98 ! unfortunately we went on a day that the trashiest of clientele chose to shop , and well , we ended up in the crossfire of an altercation between some angry ladies and the store owner . other than the low class behavior exhibited by fellow shoppers , we walked away with loads of trendy shoes without breaking the bank .
1	the woman who helped me pick out my frames was amazing . being my first pair she went through all my options to find something that looked good on me . the doctor i saw explained everything to me so that i understood , he went a little fast for me but that 's ok. the techs were not that friendly and they had me going back and forth a couple of times because of the machines stopped working .
0	tried this when i was stopping by postnet a few stores away . the place was empty at lunchtime but figured we would give it a try anyway . the staff were very friendly but the food was really uninspiring .
0	i left my card at town tavern sunday night . i 've been calling every day to ask them if i can come by and get my card . today , about $ 2000+ in charges posted to my credit card account . there is a bar tender or waitress at this place who is either using my card or sold my card to someone . i would n't go to this place , ever .
1	by far the best tuna sammich i have ever had ! i do n't know what they do to make a simple tuna sammich so addicting but its a problem for my waistline . i tell myself though that tuna is healthy so it cancels out all the mayo . whatever makes me feel better , right ? their turkey cranberry sammich is very good as well and can be somewhat decent for you if you get it with no mayo . paradise makes great pasta salads and soups as well . i am in love with their paradise pasta salad . the greek pasta salad is also delicious as is the seafood pasta salad . make sure you get a small bowl of the seafood pasta salad because it has alot of mayo in it and can be a bit overpowering unless you like to eat mayo as a meal . for soups , i love the low fat tortilla soup . its brothy but has an excellent flavor and i can feel good about eating it . make sure you get the roll that is supposed to come with it . its soft and a good accompaniment . i have also tried their roasted tomato soup which is very tasty as well . as for their salads , i 'm a fan of their bbq chicken salad . lastly , the one reason you much try paradise bakery is their cookies , particularly the chocolate chip . these come with all sammiches which makes me very happy . the lemon zester cookies are amazing as well and not too lemony/ tart . if you are looking for a bakery to get cookies or sweets from , this is actually one of the lower priced places to go . i got a dozen to have in the hotel room for a bachelorette party and they were only 8.00 whereas other bakery 's wanted to charge like 15.00. not a bad price in my book for cookies . however , i did mark a star off because all their other food ( sammiches , salads , and soups ) are a bit overpriced . to get a whole sammich with a cup of soup ( no drink ) , its 12.00 ! ! ! that 's a bit steep to me considering that their sammiches are not that big . i still come here though because their tuna is just that good !
1	super fresh and amazing flavors ! one of the better vietnamese places i 've been to . try the mushroom soup while you 're there !
0	wanted to get a sectional reupholstered and ended up with a nightmare of an experience .
0	two stars because a friend 's room was broken into by one of their staff and we received no good explanation or an adequate apology . bed was fantastic , room has a nice modern design , although the ubiquitous and played out light granite was in evidence here . really like the gadget oriented amenities ( video hook up for ipods and iphones ) . after comparing it to the venetian , however , there are far better options . i doubt they will remain a high end establishment at the end of 5 years and will fade out like the luxor . i guess it 's true that you want to avoid any mgm owned hotels . not bad , but there are far better options .
0	stay away ! this place used to be awesome ! i probably spent around $ 500 here since i learned about it , but unfortunately they replaced all of their management with new people . normally , this would n't be an issue . but the new management informed me that they no longer do any of the deals that the old management did . also , the new management was incredibly rude . every time i asked them a question , they would stare at me like i was stupid . i really liked chatting with the old employees as they were actually nice to people . needless to say , i am taking my business elsewhere and will never go back . i put up with the insane prices because i liked the employees , now it is just insane prices and rude employees . go elsewhere or order online , it will be cheaper for you .
1	best carne asada in vegas . the burritos are massive . nice variety in the menu . definitely light years ahead of roberto 's and other mexican fast food places .
0	i am not all that impressed with the service at the venetian . the room was fabulous , i will say that . 3 flat screens including one in the bathroom and a lowered suite section , as well as a giant wall sized window made me feel like i was royalty . this was after all a birthday present from my family . after i checked in though and paid my $ 100 deposit , things sort of went downhill service-wise . i found that one of my remotes did n't work and when i called the front desk , it took nearly 45 minutes to have someone come up with a replacement . he did n't even check to see if the replacement remote worked , just handed it to me and bailed . glad that it did work though . i eventually wandered down to the casino and redeemed my coupon for my $ 25 in free slot play . joined the players club and sat down to follow the instructions to redeem my $ 25 but no luck . i was hesitant to go back to the huge line and wait again for help at the players club because the agent had told me that once you put your card in the machine to play your $ 25 you could n't take the card out or you would lose the whole bit . ( why , by the way , would you only have 2 people working the players club counter at 7 pm on a saturday night ? i live in vegas , and i can tell you how insane it is on a weekend night ! ! ) anyway , i pushed the button for service and then waited nearly 30 minutes for someone to come and help me . he then had to go over the players club counter and after about 20 more minutes came back and said that they had set my card up for table games , not slots , but he had fixed it . quite aggravating to have sat there for nearly an hour . i went to dinner at cannaletto , and have nothing but amazing things to say about that restaurant , but i will post that review separately . i got back to my room at approximately 11 pm , and as soon as i opened the door i realized someone had been in my room . the lights were on low , there was music playing , and the glass i had used had been replaced . now not that i mind what was in essence turn down service and ambiance setting , i was just a little bit freaked that someone had gone into my room without my permission or notice . i decided to order room service the next morning about 9 am . i was on hold with `` in-room dining '' place for close to 10 minutes and then was told since i had only paid a $ 100 deposit i would have to pay cash for my order . apparently , you can pay a $ 100 deposit and do a pay as you go basis or pay $ 150 deposit and `` open a tab on the room . '' would have been nice to know that ahead of time . checking out was a nightmare . i was told that the room was $ 40 more expensive than originally quoted so i would have to pay the difference . originally the room had been booked on a weeknight and then changed to a weekend , and apparently the difference was n't charged to the credit card provided by my family who bought the room for me as a gift . ultimately after a discussion with the manager on duty , the hotel removed the additional charge and only billed me the $ 1 for my single local phone call . lastly , when i requested my vehicle from valet , it took 38 minutes to be brought up to the front . yes , i timed it because at that point i just knew there would be a long wait and i was curious how long it would actually be . so in short , be prepared to wait wherever you go at the venetian . the weekend i went was nothing special just a normal old saturday night in vegas . it could have been so much better .
1	my wife and i ate here twice over the weekend , once for dinner , and one for breakfast . we signed up for the ph players club thing and got a good coupon book . i do n't use coupons much , but it was $ 10 bucks more my wife could pump into a slot machine . the food was good overall . dinner was hot and they had a good mix from `` around the globe '' . the greek stuff was out of this world , and a little treasure hidden in the corner is the mexican . i do n't eat mexican food at buffets , but the beef fajita is really good steak cut thin and was yummy . breakfast was what you would expect ... nothing great but nothing really bad either . we used another coupon and it cost about $ 11 per person . i 'm sure i drank $ 11 worth of milk and oj while we ate so it was a good deal .
1	one of mine and my wife 's favorite place to dine for chinese food . service is spot on and friendly . it does say that the price is $ $ ; however , unless you 're a big eater , one entr\u00e9e will cover two people . their pot stickers are amazingly delicious !
0	the remodeled this place ... did n't really see a difference . i totally did n't know they had cabanas to rent out and what not . it was like 300 for one though and you get the cabana and a bottle . little much considering its hurricane bay . i could get that in vegas for less and at least it 's vegas ! it 's right down the street from me so i 'll go if i have friends going . its very casual and they have a dance floor and karaoke in another room . mixed crowd . smoking patio . its a-ok. parking sucks and there are tons of cops ... so be careful .
0	this place is really worthy of 2.5 stars , as it 's passable , neither good nor bad . i ordered the general tso 's chicken dinner portion , and while the portion size was decent , both the rice and the chicken were about as bland ( and overcooked ) as one could get . it did n't taste `` bad '' by any means , but if given the choice , i would order from some place else .
1	so good .. so fun .. .. definitly worth it ! !
0	they are expensive , and rude and inexperienced customer service reps. the cable guys came out 7 times and still could n't connect my cable from outside , finally the last guy said .. '' oh we are not allowed to do that from the outside , you have to get a private company '' ... wtf ! ! ! ! and they charged me for it , i called and siputed for months ! ! !
0	we sat at the bar on new year 's day to use a gift card . the bartender gave good service but the food runner was not friendly at all . as for the food , it was not up to par . the southwestern egg rolls were good as they are at any chilis i 've been to . the beef tacos did not have seasoning . the beans that came with the tacos were cold and the rice was under cooked . we do n't frequent chilis a lot but this by far was the worst one food wise . we heard others complaining about cold beans as well . their beer cooler was also broken and they had only two beers on draft . unless i get another gift card here i wo n't go back .
0	my family decided to have a 3 day luxury vacation on 2/20/2013 - 2/22/2013 . i made a big mistake ; a huge mistake to picked mgm . on 2/1 , i reserved the room ( they named it skyline marquee suite ) , paid a fairly high price . on 2/3 , i sent an email to reserve 4 tickets for the show `` ka '' in the hotel . on 2/5 , i called in and confirmed that the tickets will be ready at the time we check in . finally , the day arrived and we drove to mgm with a great happy holiday mood . we arrive at 4pm and the room was not ready . when asked , `` please wait around , we do n't know when will it be ready but i will call you . '' of course , there were no show tickets . 2 adults and 2 kids , we were walking around the hotel ( with our bags and cases ) from front desk to concierge desk to box office ( each of them following a line ) , still no show tickets . finally we got into our suites . i need some robe . i called the housekeeping requesting 4 pairs of sleepers . the housekeeping told me there are sleepers in the bathroom . after seriously searching around all the 2 bathrooms while talking on the phone , i still find no sleepers . after a lot of conversation finally i have to yell `` could you please bring us 4 pairs of sleepers anyways ? 30 minutes later , the sleepers were delivered . the sleepers are inside the robe inside the closet , not in the bathroom . next morning , i walked my family to a grand canyon tour downstairs at 6:00. partially dressed ; still sleepy like hell , at 6:10 , i could not open the door because the room key decided to quit working . i went to the front desk and was asked to show id to help me get back into my room . i had no id with me . mgm computer was down and can not verify my key and give me another key . i had no id , no money , no room , no working key , was so sleepy and so poorly dressed . i surrender . i wanted to sleep on the carpet . the manager heard my horrible experience and decided to waive some money from my bill . i do n't want money ; i want my show , my bed , and my nice luxury trip back . it is my first visit to mgm and of course the last visit too . next time if someone invites me there , i would sleep in my car instead . at least i can always open my car with my key without showing my id .
1	all great tapas . pricey . and i only complain about prices when the portions are small . but look up the definition of tapas . bocaditos might be more appropriate . if you have the money to burn , come . my favorite part was when the hot waiter poured a lemonade/spanish beer mixture into my mouth . ; -p you can never go wrong with sangria . i was slurring my words by the second cup . this is definitely the place to be pre-marquee .... or heck even post-marquee . oh and the lobster paella was okay . my mom 's is better . but if you do n't have the luxury of having a spanish mother , then you 'd probably enjoy theirs . just get the damn full lobster because we ordered the half and i was left yearning .
1	15 years we 've been going to nw clinic for children . since the week our daughter was born . we 've been going to dr. kennedy since before she was a kennedy and we prefer to see nobody else . we 've seen other doctor 's in the office at times , but none are as fabulous and dr. k. love her . trust her . highly recommend her . simply awesome !
0	came here because the other restaurants around had a long wait . so- we tried this . the appetizer - antipasto board sucked ! do n't waste $ 11.95 on that . did i mention it sucked ? i 've had this at other places and i was so disappointed . the wait time was long just for the appetizer- waiting long when i 'm hungry makes me very unhappy . my 3 stars goes to the over priced pizza . meat lover and artichoke was very good . not coming back- but wanted to share that the appetizer was nasty . good luck .
1	i used to work nearby , and after a 2 year hiatus , returned for dinner . it 's a small strip mall joint , with wood decor and accents , with a bar running nearly the full length of the place . my usual bento box lunch was n't on the dinner menu , so i opted to order a la carte . i started with a bowl of miso , it 's always nice and flavorful here , not watered down , and worked wonders on my sore throat ! i 'll have to remember that the next time i 'm sick ! we also started with spicy calamari . the calamari is served in bite-sized squares , lightly fried and served with spicy mayo . it was a nice departure from your everyday deep-fried calamari appetizer plate . as for their sushi , i love their tootsie roll , it 's so crunchy and sweet , and is a must try . i 'm also a fan of their shrimp killer and spicy tuna rolls . this time i got the tootsie roll and the lighting roll . the tootsie was fantastic as always , but i was n't a huge fan of the lighting roll , i 'm not sure if i just did n't like the flavor combination , but it tasted too oniony . service is decent , although i remember our servers being more attentive during lunch hours . still , no complaints . all in all , if you 're craving sushi , it makes a great lunch spot , and it made for a good cheap dinner with friends . there are better sushi places out there , but sushi q is worth a stop if you 're in the area and in the mood .
0	my husband purchased a very expensive desktop for me for my birthday . when we set it up , we had difficulty with my emails not being received , as well as a few other issues . i packed it up and brought it into the store where it was purchased , looking for assistance with set up . the staff was polite , but for the first 30 minutes the 'team ' was feverishly trying to sell me programs for the computer . they were really giving me the hard sell to buy all of these programs at an additional fee . one of the guys even asked me to pull up and show him photos of mine on the internet . every time , i mentioned trying to 'fix ' the issue of email first , they kept steering me towards purchasing additional items or a more expensive computer . after the wheeling and dealing of the clearly commission based staff , i had to be rude and say , `` look , i just want my computer to receive my email ! '' i was told that , my husband should have set that all up in the store at the time of purchase and that now it would cost an additional $ 200 for any assistance ! ! basically i had to tell them to effoff and now i have a very expensive dust collector at my house . apple customer service blows .
1	my dread started as soon as i bought the tickets . check yelp before not after you buy tickets . damn . i should have learned that after watching chris angell make my money magically disappear the previous summer . still , bombs are still my best reviews , so it was a win win either way . except i thought he was funny , really funny in places . as a disclaimer to the yelp community , i am neither related to nor employed by frank caliendo or subsidiaries thereof the guy does impressions . if you want to see clowns , see cirque , but his morgan freeman , al pacino , charles barkley , john madden and barack obama were excellent . his george bush although old was a classic . ( the real joke is on us , because we reelected him ) . let me reiterate : this show is about impressions of presidents and celebrities ... if you want to see someone jump into a cup from the ceiling , head down to the beligio
1	always enjoyed coming here . i 've been to the location in scottsdale and denver at park meadows mall . never disappointed . decor is beautiful . great for lunch or dinner . the one at park meadows is located next to an american girl doll store that does n't have a cafe inside . they honor the girls bringing their dolls to lunch . cute . skinny on the food : i am one for mixing things up when i go to a restaurant but this place is the exception . filet mignon cobb salad every time . it 's big enough to split with another person too .
0	`` it is better to look good , than to serve good . . . `` first of all , the burgers are very good . i ordered mine medium , and that 's how it actually arrived . not many places will actually cook a burger to order . maybe they say they will , but no . the fries ( both sweet potato and regular ) were tasty . so no real complaints about the food . but . . . come on sam fox . . . you ca n't just put model-looking women out there as servers and hostesses , have them take far too long to seat us because they could n't figure out which tables were open , deny that a special was being offered ( until i showed the email for it on my phone ) , have them take 10 minutes or so to bring a glass of wine , delay a simple food order by about 20 minutes or so , repeatedly neglect water and drink refills , forget that the burger was ordered without a bun , and expect customers not to notice because they 've been blinded by an abundance of voluptuary feminine goodness . i 've gotten better service at actual stripjoints that served food . so , not really a fan . maybe caught them on a bad night ( though the tuesday night crowd did n't seem like it would have been too imposing ) . i might give them another chance , but then if i 'm paying $ 11 for a burger ala carte , basically everything needs to be perfect to convince me to go back . smashburger and 5 guys are just down the street , and i 'd rather not pay for the pretention of service .
1	i stayed at the mandalay bay for a bachelorette party and was pleasantly surprised : you walk into the lobby and it looks like an old charming ( huge ) hotel straight out of the movie titanic . check in was uneventful , but the bell desk was very responsive with my luggage . the room itself spacious and the bathroom was great . 2 sinks , separate toilet , tub and shower and all clean and fresh . only thing is that it is too far to walk to the main strip ( bellagio et al ) but a cab is no more than 10 bucks . casino is less crowded than others on center strip . i would recommend it .
1	we really enjoyed the food and the service ! the co-owner who catered our wedding came to greet us and took care of our 9 month old . talk a about family-friendly restaurant ! we are from san francisco and when visiting az we will definitely be stopping here for exceptional food and service !
1	fear farm was pretty good . there are 5 separate haunts to go through which breaks down to about $ 5 a piece . not a bad deal . the houses are all themed differently and are pretty well done . my biggest issue with fear farm was the `` club dead '' teen pop blaring at full volume . it really took away from the feel of the haunted houses . we went on a sunday and the crowds were n't to bad but i 've heard it gets really packed on saturday nights ...
0	they have really great food , however do n't expect food to come out quick . sometimes service is amazing and other times it 's pretty meh . still it 's a really good food spot if you just want to chat and have lunch with someone .
1	not a daring sushi eater . i only eat cooked stuff but this place has some really good cooked rolls . according to my person , they have really good tuna selections .
0	i read quite a few reviews on yelp prior to checking this place out with a group of 10 or so . we arrived and the table was n't ready just yet - we ordered a variety of cocktails , menu driven cocktails , beer and wine . i had an 8th street ale - always a good choice . i had to ask for a cold glass to put it in and when i was served the 2nd one , they did n't include it . i had to ask again . the food : pretty good , actually . however , its totally overpriced and the portions are pretty small . so it makes the hurt on the wallet that much more severe . our waitress was cool , she put up with a lot of conversations in our group , sometimes being loud and not paying attention . i would go back again , but most likely for lunch . hopefully you would get the same size meal for a few bucks less . by the way , i had the pasta with rib eye in it ( i forget the name ) and my wife had the carbonara . they were both good !
0	dirty , not well maintained at this location . the numbering of the rooms is absolutely crazy . simplicity is not in the mindset of whoever needs to redesign the classroom addresses .
1	awesome happy hour and the staff is great ! reasonably priced average plate is between $ 10 to $ 15 . live music every night ! awesome local talent which sets the mood !
0	came in for lunch and had a horrible time ! i 've never been to a macaroni grill but have worked in the food industry long enough to know what good service is .... the server neglected us ... multiple other tables who arrived after received their orders before us ... and when our food did finally come the it was barely warm and my friend recieved the wrong sandwich ... we called the manager over to voice our concerns only to be scolded him . he did comp our meal .... but our overall experience was terrible ! needless to say they 've definitely lost our business .
1	had lunch here today with my mom around 12:30pm . the place was busy , but not packed . i like the fact that two of the walls of this restaurant are windows so there is plenty of light and people watching to be had here at scottsdale quarter . we were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away . we quickly realized that the chairs are n't comfy at all . the ones on the patio look like they might have more give , but the ones inside , well , let 's just say my bum has had better to sit on . the waitress came soon after and got our drink order in , just iced tea 's for us , although i did see a full bar along one of the walls . i ordered the blt & e ( the ' e ' standing for fried egg ) that came on 9 grain bread with a side salad . my mother ordered the pulled pork sandwich as recommended by the waitress . we had our food out to us in about 6 minutes , wowza . my blt & e was tasty , but what really had me going was the cucumber vinaigrette dressing that came with my salad ( yes , a salad dressing stole my attention ) . i could have eaten that with a spoon it was so good . my mother 's pulled pork sandwich was delicious , it came with appleslaw which was unique and totally made the sandwich . you can get the appleslaw as a side and i would recommend that if you are going to eat here and not get anything that already comes with it . the food was good , i would come back and try it again . i like the open kitchen the restaurant offers and the fact that they have a bathroom inside this restaurant . i know some do n't around here and make you go to a general public one outside . just as an fyi there is no light switch in the bathroom so stop trying to find one and just walk in .... the lights will turn on automatically and you 'll save yourself some time and confusion , but i like to learn the hard way : )
0	play here , but do not stay here . i 'm a vegas local and i 've seen far better hotel rooms in most of the other station casinos . i booked here on the 4th of july because it had good rates and it was last minute for my mother . the room looked nothing like the photos on their website , which were conveniently taken at night ( most things look better in the dark , right ? ) . the air conditioner made a ton of noise and smelled . the ice machine on our floor was broken . the phone did n't even have labels of how to call the front desk ( just a phone with normal keypad ) . we requested a non-smoking floor , and about 1 hr into our stay , smoke from the hallway was pouring into our room . my mother 's asthma kicked up , and we had to leave . walls were paper thing and you could hear everything next door . the room next door was screaming children , screaming parents , slamming doors ... if that tells you anything about the type of patron that stays here . we immediately checked out . they were nice enough to refund us and not ask any questions . maybe it 's happened to them before ? haha .
1	a little pricey , even for a gourmet burger , but the burger was good . we sat on the balcony , and enjoyed a view of the golf course . the service was lacking a little ( we had to find a waitress when we first sat down and continued to look for someone for refills for water ) . this place is on my list of top burger places in the valley but just be prepared for the bill .
0	i recently hosted an event onsite at the four seasons . i have to say , it was by far the worst experience i 've had in my seven years of hosting events for my company . i set the expectations with our rep in regards to av needs and signage needs in advance . i took the time to tour the space the day before in order to iron out any kinks . our rep even offered up her cell phone number so that i could reach her in case we encountered any trouble during our event on sunday night as she would not be onsite . sunday evening rolls around , and the only people available to help me are the servers and bartender - no onsite event coordinator , and the av team has gone home for the night . i certainly did n't expect the servers or bartender to be able to help with setting up the event space tvs and sound system , so they did the right thing by calling the manager . the manager claimed to not know how to set up either of our needs , so she did n't bother to come help us . she did , however , decide to come up to the space half an hour later letting us know we could not put directional signage up in the lobby or anywhere outside of our event space . this would have been nice to know upfront seeing as the venue is extremely hard to navigate as-is . since she decided to make an appearance , we asked about the sound system . she showed us right where we could hook up our ipod to play music , which could have saved us a lot of headache had she decided to show up when we requested her half an hour earlier . on top of all of this , i had called and texted our original rep ( who stated she 'd be available if we had any issues ) and did not receive a response until 11pm - after our event had ended . she also never bothered to ask how the event went . needless to say , i would sum this review up by saying that the four seasons does not have the staff or means to support events . they are disorganized and clearly do n't care to follow through once they take your money . i would strongly encourage you look elsewhere as vegas has no shortage of much better options available .
1	wanting to pretty up my toes for the big d-day , i headed over to polished nails and spa . i was first excited about them because they had raving reviews ... but lately it 's been going down so i definitely went in with some hesitation . first off , i 've been trying to sign up for their email specials but have yet to receive anything ( even though i signed up months ago ) . the receptionist said they sent an email out in december , but i never got it . bummer . on their website , they have daily specials and i wanted to take advantage of one of them . when i called in on a thursday , the receptionist was n't that familiar with what the special was or even if it was valid since they had n't updated their website in awhile . she eventually did look it up and it was supposed to be `` free nail art with purchase of a pedicure . '' she said it was still valid and i went forward with booking our appointments . i initially tried for a 4:00 appointment for two pedicures , the next available time was 5:00 pm , but she was able to get us both in at 4:45 pm . we arrived a bit early so we could get situated and pick our our nail colors . they were packed - all the workers had customers in front of them and the phone was ringing . no kidding about making an appointment ! there 's also a self service cooler on the left - so help yourself ! we were seated in the pedicure chairs by 4:50 pm , so there was no delay there . now , i have n't been to too many nail salons , but i guess i 'm used to be being taken care of . the simplest thing like helping me into the pedicure chair , moving the arm rest out , helping me set down my beverage , and showing me how the massage chair works can really do wonders . unfortunately , that did n't happen here - and the sight of watching a 38 week pregnant girl stepping gingerly into the chair can be quite a sight . a little assistance would have been really nice ! ( plus , we were carrying our purse , magazines , beverage , shoes , etc . - so we definitely did n't have any extra hands available . ) after the mom and i finally got settled into our chair and we figured out how the controls worked , we tried to relax for our little pampering session . diane ( aka mom ) was assigned to take one of us and she chose me . my pedicure got started and it was pretty standard . diane kept the conversation to a minimum , which was totally fine with me . i did notice that she started cutting my cuticles and went for the baby toe first . and yes , she made it bleed . i could tell by the way she kept wiping it , covering it , getting the blue stuff to put on it , and then the way it would sting when i put my foot back into the water . hmmm ... bleeding on the first toe ? also , i think diane might have had a cold or something because she was coughing ( a lot ) on my feet . and all i could think about was thank goodness i was n't getting a manicure too . i completely forgot about the free nail art that i was supposed to get until after the fact . whereas the mom had a younger girl working on her ( nicole ) that was very chatty from the beginning . at first , i thought she was talking to the mom , but then i realized she was actually talking to another customer next to the mom . i learned later that the mom did n't really appreciate that and wished nicole had spent more time focusing on her and her feet instead of facing someone else and chatting with them . she also mentioned that nicole could have spent more time massaging her feet , which i would have to agree with too . the mom was finished first , despite her starting later and having more work done . nicole sent her to the drying station so she could dry her toes further , whereas diane just said she was all done . i did n't really know where to go after that since there were only two chairs available in the drying area and they were both taken . there is a really young staff here and they are quite the social bunch - the employees do talk a lot amongst themselves ( in english ) and i guess it feels more like a hair salon with all the random banter going on regarding house stuff , weekend plans , etc . they are extremely busy and walk-ins will get serviced , if you have something minor to take care of . ( which sucks if that means your technician leaves you to take care of a walk-in . ) they also have a referral program , but the new customer has to have the referral card with them for you to get any benefits from it . other promotions include : * buy 4 spa pedicures for $ 99 and get a mani/pedi free . ( $ 137 value ) * buy 4 acrylic fills for $ 75 and get a acrylic set free . ( $ 100 value ) * buy 9 manicures for $ 99 and get two manicures free . ( $ 132 ) you get 10 % off your next appointment if you book immediately . it 's been a week since i got my pedicure and my toes look pretty damn good still , so that 's a major bonus point . i wished she did scrub my feet more so they could be baby soft , but that did n't happen . i did purchase one of their value cards , so i 'll be going back at a less busier time i hope . 3.5 stars .
0	this is in no way , shape or form an exceptional or good starbucks . it was busy , and overall not super prompt with their service . however , it was n't really bad either , and after my super early morning flight to vegas , i was just so darn happy to have a place to get a latte on my footpath in to my room in my hotel , that i could squeal . thank you for rescuing my caffeination and my coherence with a latte , my friends .
0	the first time i went there after it switched from exxon , an attendant came running out to pump my gas for me . i checked to see if i accidently pulled into the full service island ( do those even exist anymore ? ) i had n't , but the guy pumped my gas and cleaned my windshield just the same . wow ! great service or so i thought . i gave the guy a $ 2 tip ( all i had on me at the time ) . he just looked at it , then looked at me with a disgusted look like i was supposed to kiss his feet and give him a $ 20 because he actually did his job . i guess the tips were n't adding up because these days , they do n't even acknowledge you anymore . there are never any squeegees to clean your window , either . i guess they 're afraid that someone might steal their precious $ 2.63 `` assets '' this gas station is the only one for a few blocks around , and boy do they take full advantage of that fact ! they are regularly $ 0.05 to $ 0.10 higher than even the rip-off chevron or shell stations on chaparral . anymore , i just use this station when i 'm afraid i wo n't make it to another one . just to annoy them and cost them money in credit card charges , i only ever put 1 gallon in . if you drive just a couple of miles south on hayden , you can find gas for as much as $ 0.40 cheaper ( circle k usually ) ! i 'll go way out of my way to patronize a company that does n't try to gouge it 's customers . taylor gas is not one of them tho .
1	just took my little lulu there , she started yelping and was in pain and i could n't figure out why . she 's a chiweenie , so was worried about her back , as weenie dogs tend to have back problems . ca n't remember which doctor i saw , but he did a very thorough physical exam , turns out she has a pain in her neck , not sure why . after a toenail clipping and some medications , we are on our way home . let 's hope this makes her better , i love my pets , they are like my kids .
0	my boyfriend and i had been wanting to try this place for awhile , so when we saw a meet up group was scheduled to try this place out , we decided to sign up . i have n't found my perfect burger joint in las vegas yet , and i was hoping this would be it . not so much . the restaurant itself has a good atmosphere . chalk boards on the wall that you can leave messages on give it a nice cozy touch . there is a bar area that you can get alcohol at if you wish , however , the rest of the restaurant is a very family oriented environment . a walk up counter where you place your order gives the restaurant an additional casual feel . unfortunately , the hamburgers themselves are just not that good . to begin with , the menu only offers about 6 different burger options . the woman across the table from me had ordered the `` caprese '' burger , which was supposed to be a twist on a caprese salad . which is actually a cool idea . a generous slice of mozzarella was atop her burger , but the one tomato slice looked sad and carelessly plopped on there , and the few limp slices of basil looked limp . my boyfriend ordered the barbecue burger , which caramelized onions in place of straw onions . in a weird twist , the `` homemade '' barbecue sauce is actually a cross between ketchup and barbecue , and the restaurant has neither , plain ketchup , or plain barbecue . a conservative dollop was on top of his burger , along with soggy onions that appeared to have been swimming in grease , and sitting on a fryer for an extended period of time . ( note that the menu does have options besides classic hamburgers such as veggie burgers and a salmon burger- which i did n't try and ca n't comment on . however , if you are a burger place and ca n't make a good hamburger , i just do n't trust you to make experimental substitutes ) . i will say that the `` i love bacon '' burger i ordered- a combination of ground bacon , and brisket , topped with bacon and `` bacon mayo '' was pretty good , and the most impressive of the burgers i saw . it was maybe a bit dry , but then again , that is what happens when you make a hamburger out of brisket . finally , our order of sweet potato fries were somewhat bland , a little overdone , and nothing to really get excited over . the parmesan garlic fries that our dining companions ordered were alright to munch on while we waited for our food , but again , nothing i would miss if i never had again . overall , it was an ok experience , but given the many restaurants in the area , i doubt i will be back .
1	i got introduced to frank and oak last month by a friend . and it has been a great experience so far . i hate going out to shop for clothes . i also rarely shop for clothes . and i am very picky and particular in terms of what i want in style . i am always looking for a classic , timeless style in clothing . and it 's hard to find when out physically shopping . maybe because i do n't go out looking hard enough ? i do n't know , i have better things to do than search for clothes : p i scrolled through frank and oak and found a few things i liked and ordered them : a casual button shirt , a thicker grey button overshirt , and jeans . everything fits great . their sizing charts and sizing information are very accurate . if you fall within the perimeters of their sizing style , the fit will be great . i am 5 ' 8 , 155 pounds , 30 ' waist , athletic build and their clothes so far have fit like a glove . i am very impressed by the sizing and quality of the material . i am also impressed by the style . i will definitely be a repeat customer and will order as i find items/styles i like . my only word of caution would be to closely check their sizing chart/sizing guides and make sure their sizing style will work for you . i was fortunate that for my body type , it fits extremely well . also , hunt club is a great deal because of the free shipping and 8 % back . just remember to sign onto your account and press skip between the 1st-7th of every new month if you do n't want anything .
0	i enjoy norm 's eggs cafe as one of those places that never really lets you down . the food is always on par no matter what you order , the service is always quick and pleasant , and the place always seems to have an available table . i have visited several times and have ordered various high-protein entrees and breakfast items such as the chicken fried steak and the steak and eggs meal . the highlight of the $ 7.99 chicken fried steak is the gravy . i love gravy . i love all types of gravy . but the gravy here at norm 's is phenomenal ! the chicken fried steak itself is served with two eggs cooked to your liking , homemade biscuits , and choice of potato or fruit . the $ 8.95 steak and eggs meal was pretty cut and dry . i typically order my steaks medium rare as i have learned there is more potential for flavor this way . it came out a little too done , which is fine as i am not as picky as most eaters . it was a bit dry and a bit tough to cut through and i was thankful the server had brought me a steak knife and some a1 sauce . the steak itself was 8 oz. , and came with two eggs , choice of potato or fruit , and also toast . all in all , my experiences here were okay . i 'd much rather frequent norm 's than an ihop or a denny 's when it comes to breakfast type food . also , be sure to give their $ 3.99 breakfast menu a peak ! not too shabby .
0	i was excited to finally try pacos after much delay on my part getting there . for me it was just ok. service was really good , which was a nice surprise . the food ; however , was a separate surprise . granted it could have been what i ordered too . ordered the enchiladas ( ca n't remember the exact name ) and there was so much cheese sauce/queso all over the dish that it was hard to gave a bite of anything , including the rice & beans , without eating cheese . being from wisconsin , i like me some cheese , but this was too much . either way , i 'll give it another shot because the location is great !
0	when we entered we were greeted by a whiff of a backed up septic system which lingered throughout the evening . we were early but they still made us wait even though there were 20 empty tables . the service was good . . the steaks were ok but not at all worth the price they were asking for . the sides were small and the whole experience was cheapened by giving us forms to fill out about our dinner . the atmosphere might have been ok except for the horrible smell . i will not return
1	good food but , as always , very crowded . i wish they 'd open for bakery service during the week and use the profits to expand the seating area .
1	best steak special in vegas ! ! ! i live in the mid-west ( ks ) and have my share of great steaks . $ 100 steak in kc on the plaza , home raised steak you name ..... ellis island is good as all of them !
0	really not impressed at all . after waiting twenty minutes for a table ( when half of them were empty , apparently they were trying not to open that section or something ? ) , we sat down and waited for drinks . ten minutes later , after not having seen a waitress , we decided to get food and figured we would order drinks when we got back . after finishing my first plate , i got up and asked one of the hostesses if she could send a waiter/waitress over to get our drinks , as ourselves and the other three tables around us were still waiting on that . she could have been polite . instead , she literally told me that i was being impatient ( no water or any other drinks after 20-25 minutes ) , and basically told me to sit down and be quiet , and that they 'd get me drinks when they were ready to . we should have left then , and asked for a refund . the manager did very little to help , though she did say she would have a talk with her staff and see what happened . we got our drinks more than a half hour after being seated at our table , and the food was mediocre at best . i also had an upset stomach that afternoon , and that was the only thing i 'd eaten since the day before . i only rated it two stars because the food was so-so , but it was pretty bland and after the entire experience , it was not worth it . i would n't go back , and the staff 's rudeness has made certain that the aria will not see another dollar our of my wallet .
0	horrible ! do n't go to this place ... with the new owners they probably changed chefs as well . they suck big time ! mochi was ice frozen ... when we complained about the quality of sushi & how hard the mochi was they did n't care . horrible ! stay away from this sushi joint !
0	you will be horribly disappointed if you have to pay to get into this hellhole . terrible bar service , overpriced drinks , unattractive drunk girls being pulled on stage . there were 3 coyote girls trying to run the show , but were n't doing a very good job of it ... it was as if they were just going through the motions , and they looked bored . after 5 minutes watching a bunch of drunk girls making spectacles of themselves , i was bored to tears and wanted to leave . please do yourselves a favor and go somewhere else , there are so many other better options out there ! !
0	this service , actually a contradiction in terms , is horrible . booked a rt 2 weeks prior . on the departure the vehicle never showed up . they told me to take a cab . escalated to a supervisor but best i could get was a promise of a refund claim . back in the taxi line from caesars . stay away from these guys .
1	yes , i know it 's a carl 's jr , but the guy who took our order ( drive thru ) was very polite and happily took our coupons without any hassles . added bonus ... they give free doggy treats to anyone who has their dog in the car with them . totally cool !
0	now i love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off ! ! ! it was packed as usual so the food took extra long . the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal , when they seated us it looked like the booth had not been properly cleaned , and the bathroom was just the nastiest bathroom in america . like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was . i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day . i believe when you are an establishment with meals over $ 10 your bathroom should be spotless . this is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere , not red lobster . i know red lobster is not a 5 star restaurant but come on .
1	i do n't really like bbq . i do n't really like southwest style cooking . i actually do n't really like bobby flay or his cocky attitude either ... ... i liked mesa grill . while the location may not do it for some , my buddy and i stopped in here for a quick bite to eat while betting on the nfl games as it is in direct view of the sportsbook at caesars . immediately on being seated we were brought a complimentary bread basket with absolutely amazing jalapeno corn bread , biscuits , and a cheesy garlic bread that was out of this world . i ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around bsing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced . for meals , my buddy ordered the mesa burger with double cheddar cheese , grilled vidalia onion , and horseradish mustard on a house roll with southwest fries ..... the burger was enormous and per his word `` awesome . '' i opted for the thick cut ahi tuna nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas . while it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu , i still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna i 've yet to consume . the portion was large and at only $ 11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread , nachos , soda , and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $ 15 . while this is n't `` 5 star '' dining , it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice 'bar ' setting when in vegas . in retrospect i wish i 'd have ordered dessert , but with dinner reserves at simon later that evening i did n't want to overindulge ..... y'know , after eating the paris buffet for breakfast .
0	the fruitmarket is conveniently located just next to the train station which means that if you have some time to kill and fancy a coffee and/or a bite to eat , you do n't need to settle for expensive and sub-par station food . our coffees were lovely , but our cakes left a bit to be desired as the man 's carrot cake was quite dry and my orange and almond cake was swimming in frosting/sugar drizzle and tasted nothing of almonds . staff were a bit funny about two people having to sit on a table for two ( rather than a larger one ) , which i could get if it was at all busy and if we did n't have a million bags between us , but there was only one table other than us and we ended up crammed in a corner with our bags spilling into the walkway . totally fine for a pre-train coffee , but not somewhere i would come otherwise .
0	miranda has been screening my text messages and calls for weeks now regarding a refund for the living social deal that was never used . i have never been in contact with someone so unprofessional . do not go here , she will rip you off . i imagine the only reason this place is still even open is because she manages to take people 's money through her group on and living socials and not providing actual services .
1	this place is great ! bought a brand new hd on my birthday . the staff was super ! they walk us through the entire building , clothing , accessories and shop . we even went into the shop and checked it out , awesome ! they gave us education on the bike , how to 's and what all the buttons are , the do not touch unless you know what your doing . sales guy rob was a very good wealth of knowledge , defiantly helped with making our choice ! clothing sales lady very nice , if i could have been slower on trying on my clothes she would have been able to cater to me even more . the entire staff at chandler hd eventually came out and talked with us , started our bike before we made our final decision .. vvvrrroomm , vvrroom , vvrroomm ! thank you chandler hd
1	best mexican food in town -- the fact that it is healthy is a bonus ( that is if you can resist those warm chips ) ! i 've never been disappointed and have been a customer for 17 years !
0	we 've been there three times . one time the food was excellent the other two it was very bad . they do n't seem to have any consistency in the kitchen . all three times the table service was lousy . they did n't bring plates or forks to the table and when they brought the food out i had to ask them to bring us something to eat with . they asked us what we wanted to drink we told them water but then did n't bring it . i had to go to the kitchen and ask for it . we wo n't be going back .
1	we went here for a late morning meal on saturday . i am in love . i had the caprices sandwich with the sweet potato fries on the side . tasty sweet potato fries are the way to my heart and maizie 's did an awesome job with them . my sister and mom had the omelette and french toast and also had good things to report . the setup was great , it 's a little small , but i did n't feel like the tables were crammed together . our waiter was super attentive and friendly . my sister tells me they have great drinks so i will be returning in the evening hours to give them a try for sure .
0	first tall asian looking girl waitress no smile no greeting just says what fo u want to drink worst customer service ever i order a chicken marsala it was super sweet the waitress told me the all sales are final what the hell is this a dollar store owner told me i am stuck with this dish he wont take it back and get me what i want he lost a customer been coming here for 7 years
1	food is good and the price is good . staff is friendly as well . it is a great place in this neck of the woods . i am looking forward to going again and again .
1	some odd food combinations and strange english translations , but well cooked , professionally served , and entirely approved of . breakfast is of lesser quality , with buffet scrambled eggs and cooked from frozen pastries , and some items ( osso bucco , for example ) not american diner friendly - but very good . `` modern '' french cuisine , with locally sourced ingredients .
1	my family and i had dinner here during the week night , and it was n't too busy . we were seated right away at a table near the water fountain and had a nice view of the buddha statue and with a pretty lotus flower sheer screen backdrop . the restaurant has a nice tranquil ambiance with romantic dim lighting and modern asian design . the service was friendly and attentive . we had the tup tim fritters appetizer which were crispy chicken & shrimp dumplings with a chili sweet-sour sauce for dipping . for dinner , we had pad thai with chicken and shrimp , brown rice and the tamarind seafood combo with crispy fillet of tilapia , shrimp , scallops and squid in a spciy sweet and sour sauce . our thai appetizers and entrees were delicious but pricey .
1	i 'm not a fan of the krispy kreme donut . not at all . i like little donut shoppes operated by people and not machines with burnt sienna tables . al 's is just that place . it 's been at its location on maryland and harmon for decades , and these puppies are made by hand . the people who come in here are regulars and there 's a reason : these doughnuts are simply better . there 's no shiny machine , they do n't offer you paper hats , but my goodness do they fry up some delicious rings and bars and anything else you can imagine .
1	i acutely came here the first time cause i was in the area and looking for a new place to eat since the mcdon down the street was closed . i found this place it had all good reviews except for one , that one was s new account with no friends and only one review . i figured it had to be a false hateful review but there was only one way to find out and that is to try it out . i am so glad i did food is great you know for a burger place .
0	very bad experience on 7-30-2014. took two interns for lunch at the cafe fiesta . it was senior wednesday . one third of tables occupied-30 minute wait . told it was the kitchen staff . computer system down and can not use points-cash only . online menu many more items than sit down menu . $ 28.00 for meal-no senior discount with points . was told that is the way it is and i was n't the only one affected . last visit for me .
0	this place is as trendy as they get . they put more effort into the gimmick of a sushi restaurant than they do the sushi . for starters , the sushi is way too expensive . something i 'm seeing all over the valley . the happy hour prices were even expensive . if you go , go during happy hour . that 's the only way it 's justifiable to buy sushi at those prices . also , the sushi selections were not that great . where is the seared ahi tuna ? i was surprised to see they had poke on the menu ( which they spelled poki for some reason ) , but of course , it cost way too much for what was probably not enough . i just got back from living in seattle for five years . there , sushi is made by actual japanese people ( or , more and more these days , koreans ) . it does n't cost so much and they put a lot more effort into it . i swear to god , the guy behind the sushi bar at sapporo was mexican trying to pull off the most stereotypical fu-man-chu look imaginable . i guess my biggest complaint was the waiter and service . he took way too long to take our order , did n't bring me my beer , and it took way too long for our sushi rolls to come out . also , do n't try to correct my pronunciation of sapporo with a mispronunciation of the word . maybe i 'm being too harsh based on just their sushi . they do specialize in japanese food . maybe they have great udon noodles i 'll have to try .
1	awesome , they always do the most amazing job , very clean , very friendly , never rush you and are never rude ... so glad my friend told me about this hidden little gem . i wo n't go anywhere else for my nails they are far superior to anywhere else in the area .
0	i left ferraro 's disappointed . good service could not make up for lackluster , overpriced food . i had the caesar salad and the risotto aragosta e tartufo nero ( italian vialone nano rice , lobster meat , seasonal black truffles , mascarpone , truffle oil ) . the caesar salad was good . two hearts of romaine topped with a decent caesar dressing and shaved parmigiano reggiano cheese . the risotto was a total disappointment . if there was any lobster meat in it , i could n't tell . i could neither see any or taste it . to make matters worse , i could not pick out any truffle taste in the risotto . so , essentially i had what amounted to a $ 38.00 bowl of rice . even though someone else paid for my dinner , i felt cheated ! on a brighter note , the three people in our party that had the seafood pasta absolutely raved about their dishes . the four others in the party neither complained nor expressed anything positive about their meals . finally , ferraro 's does not allow any outside wine . so , if you have a special bottle for a special occasion , plan on going somewhere else ! the best way to sum up ferraro 's is : michelin-rated prices with yelp 3 star food .
1	fun ! i was here for a convention at the hotel and we wrapped it up with a few rounds at the chandelier . bartenders were attentive , knowledgeable , chatty , and fast . the waitresses were equally pleasant . crowd was cool ; old young , ceo 's and weekend partiers all shared the same space and intermingled . not a stuck up person in the house . it lost a star because , 1. the music is pretty loungy and 11oclock hits and everyone is waiting for the uptick that never happens . 2. it seems like a stopover place for marquee , so around 1130 the place empties out and loses some energy . still , it was fun , and welcoming to the business traveler that shows up alone and the group of long time friends , alike .
0	i really like the idea of this place but for some reason i always have trouble getting served so i had to write it off . completely . while the milk shake line is pretty straight forward the line for chocolate is pretty much like a bar where everyone stands and tries to flag down one of the girls who are usually not paying attention ... the end result can be waiting 20-30 minutes to order while watching people who just walk in get their order before you ... as for the prices and quality i would say the milkshakes are a good value at around $ 5 but the chocolate is very expensive i grew up on sarris 's and the quality seems on par but twice as much $ $ $ .
0	the menu lists a $ 7 charge for upgrading any burger with soda and fries and when the bill comes $ 3.50 is listed separately as a soda and the other $ 3.50 is included in the burger line item . confusing pricing scheme and mediocre food .
0	i 've never been to the nobu in nyc . i 've heard that it blows vegas away . however , we went on a friday and dropped serious coin on average sushi . the fish seemed fresh . the sushi rice was dry . the apps were average . to bright inside to fit a 'hip ' feel . never again .
0	found this place on yelp while we were running errands in their area . previous reviews mention that it is a 'vegan ' restaurant and i want to clarify that since they use eggs , including some of the noodles , it is a vegetarian restaurant , but there is no shortage of options to choose if you so desire a vegan meal . we ordered the crispy wanton appetizer , veggie house soup , crispy beef , crispy scallop , and the fried rice with egg . the filling in the wonton was sort of a veggie mash that was bland and the wonton wrapper was thick and rather starchy . you definitely needed to dip it in the sweet sauce that accompanied the dish . the soup was a mild cabbage broth with celery , bits of carrot , fennel , and tofu cubes . i found myself adding more and more white pepper to season it . i appreciate low sodium in dishes , but it still should be seasoned well to avoid a blah blandness . the crispy beef was pretty tasty . you have to eat it right away or the sauce gooeys the crispyness into mush . the crushed peanuts on top added a nice texture . the broccoli that was served along side the dish was just steamed and a bit on the cool side when it reached our table . the crispy spicy scallops had a sweet in spicy sauce that had red bell peppers and thinly sliced persian cucumbers . the scallops were good for me but my partner could n't get over the chewy texture . they use giant oyster mushroom stems to make the scallops . there was definitely a taste of mushroom . not the dish for you if you do n't like mushrooms . the fried rice had raisins , pineapple , peas , egg , veggie ham , and veggie crab . the rice was typical fried rice in flavor with a small note of sweetness from the raisins and pineapple . the veggie ham pieces were so small , you did n't even notice them . the veggie crab had the consistency of little gelatinous snot balls and did nothing for the dish . i picked them out . the service was great . our server was overly happy and constantly smiling and even brought our toddler a free bowl of steamed rice . the ice tea is worth noting . they brew it there using red tea leaves . it was crisp and refreshing and we prob had 5 refills . the green tea is not loose leaves but is in a tea bag added to your tea pot . i would not go out of my way to come back , but if i was in close proximity , and hungry , and it was lunch time so i could get the $ 6.50 lunch special , then i 'd prob pop in for more of that crispy beef . so 2 stars for the food and an extra for our friendly server .
0	i wish i had stopped at the ihop around the corner which has now been downgraded to the second most disgusting place to eat breakfast food . it has the same overused , undercleaned feeling of ihop but without the swing-and-a-miss decor attempt . the service was friendly , if not accurate nor timely . the `` homemade '' blueberry muffin tasted as if it was a mixture of krusteaz and cement . i ate two bites of that brick twelve hours ago and i 've had the displeasure of constant `` reminders '' of its taste every few minutes since then . i ordered the alamo which was three small breakfast burritos that managed to rank below mcdonald 's similarly plasticine product in taste and texture . the beans that came with it were a brownish-gray paste that i have to admit i did n't have the courage to consume . my friend ordered eggs and hash browns and was pleased . but then , she 's not writing this review . this was , by far , the worst meal i have ever had in vegas ; and i 've eaten the $ 3.99 steak and eggs special on fremont street . i can not recommend this place to anyone that is not completely 'faced before ever entering the building .
0	personally , this location is not as good as the other one on st. rose parkway but it 's not horrible either . the food chicken fingers are so so but the artichoke dip appetizer is pretty tasty . generally they are not to busy when i go which is always a plus and they are very close to school . honestly , there is really not much to say about this place other then if your in the area and looking for either a bite to eat or a drink , it 's worth stopping in .
0	they got the worst service ever . i have no idea what 's going on with the lady there . she seems like she hates everyone and all the customers need to appreciate her service . i will never ever go there , i prefer to walk all the way to ups or fedex . i seriously do not understand how can people like her still work there .
0	walked in as i needed a simple nail polish change , which i figured i did n't have to do too much searching since it was so basic . i think i got the owner ( a woman ) as she was the only one not wearing a white coat and had an air about her that she was the boss . anyhow , i asked how much a polish change was and i was told $ 6 for my hands , $ 8 for my feet . i thought that was a bit steep , but it 's been a while since i 've just gotten a polish change , so i chalked it up to inflation . i was seated quickly and she proceeds to take of my finger nail polish . i say attempt , cause apparently she was having a difficult time ( i had good polish on and it was n't coming off as easily as she had hoped . she gets frustrated after a few seconds and proceeds to take the drill out . wth ? so i tell her , i have natural nails and do n't want my nails drilled , if she needs me to take off the polish i will ( cause she was obviously annoyed at the fact that it was n't coming right off . ) she says nothing and goes back to rubbing her cotton ball on them . a few seconds pass ( yes , literally seconds ) and she gets irritated again and reaches for her drill . this time i told her firmly that i did n't want her to use the drill . she kind of , aggressivly pushed the drill away and proceeds to try and pick off the polish with her nails . ok ... yes , the polish was tougher than usual , but honestly it was n't that serious . i 've had other techs take it off w/o getting their panties in a bunch , and it was rather alarming that she was so ticked by it . then as she 's working away , i start looking around and see they have a price chart on the table and also on the wall . i scan the prices on the table , which do n't mention the cost of a polish change , so i look on the wall and see the polish change is cheaper than what she quoted me . finding this a bit odd , i ask her if her prices have changed and she says yes , points to the one on her table and says they 've gone up . so i compare the 4 services she has listed on the table chart , to those on the wall , and they 're exactly the same . at this point , i 'm feeling a bit scammed and annoyed , but since i need to get this polish changed for a wedding i was attending shortly , i figured i 'd just stick it out for the few extra bucks i had to pay . she finishes up my hands and tells me to go sit in one of their pedicure seats to do the polish change on my toes . i asked if i could leave my shoes on ( i had sandals on ) because i 'd need to leave quickly and i did n't want to ruin my hands or feet trying to put my sandals back on or dig through my purse . she looks down at my feet and shakes her head yes ( again looking irritated ) so i get situated in the pedi chair . i thought it was a nice touch for her to put a towel under my toes so that nothing gets wet when she doused the polish remover on my feet ... and all was good , until i left the place and my toes were sticking to my shoes since the liquid soaked through anyways . once i got back to the hotel and was getting ready for the wedding , i attempted to take my shoes off , only to find the polish remover actually bleached my shoes and my feet were stained from the color of my soles . needless to say , i do n't live in phoenix anymore , so i never have to return ... but for those of you who do , i hope i can help shed light on a place where you may or may not get good service ... and a nasty attitude to boot .
0	went in at barely 7pm on a sunday night ( the night before thanksgiving , but still ) and there was no one inside but the bartenders . asked if they were still serving supper and was told that they could order us a pizza or pasta from the italian joint next door . we passed and ended up at mckibbin 's instead . maybe next time we 're in the city we 'll give them another shot . also of note is that they are opening up in the nearest storefront on the adjoining street , though not sure when . do n't know what the new location will be like .
1	if you love your pet , you 'll send them to pete and mac 's ! we have been taking our beagle ( s ) here for 3 years now . we love the attention they get and how attentive the staff is to the pets and the owners ! : ) we use them for daycare , boarding and grooming . daycare - the spend most of the day in a pack of dogs accompanied by a dedicated worker . the are allowed to roam inside and out all day . boarding- they can share runs and are always well taken care of grooming - we typically get the `` had it up to hair '' which gets everything nail to toes . we also get shedex - which also gives you a follow up de-shedding appointment a week later ! we know our dogs love going there , but most of all , we know the staff loves our dogs coming ! we get report cards and you can see that the staff is authentically excited to see our dogs again ! again , i can not recommend them enough !
0	ordered a birthday cake for my sons 1st birthday . it was awful and overpriced . the design was something a teeange boy couldve done and they did n't listen to what we wanted at all !
0	it 's not that great here . they give you tiny portions of meat . there 's definitely better places in the area .
1	good pick up at a great store . the skinny i have heard of this place for over 2 years before i decided to take the trip over , i was upset with myself as i should have been going here since the beginning . they had a great sale for the holiday weekend was able to get a few tees and a pair of roshe runs for 20 % off as i donated a toy for their christmas toy drive ( awesome ! ! ) they also have jason markk shoe cleaner which i use all the time for cheaper than amazon.com the staff was great minus one person ( asian dude ) he seems like he hates my guts when i ask anything , so i just avoid him at all cost . i will continue to support this store as they are the last true first come first served shoe release store in phoenix . they also take phone orders on release day for whatever is left i have gotten lucky a few times on some pretty exclusive shoes . if your in the area and love shoes give them a try and support a local store .
0	i have been to steinberg diagnostic medical imaging centers it was , if anything medical is possible , pleasant .
1	delicious food , great service and a nine page wine list ... makes me a very happy customer ! i had been wanting to try noca for awhile and thanks to az restuarant i finally could without causing too much damage to my bank account . the food was delicious , with only one compliant . one of my friends ordered a pasta dish that contained way too much fennel , which was n't even listed as one of the ingredients . being that fennel is very much a hate-or-love spice ... probably should mention it on the menu ... just a thought . she .. is not so much of a lover of fennel ... so it would of been good to know it would be the main flavor of her pasta dish . all of the other food was amazing ! i had the red grouper , and it was phenomenal . my two other friends had the flat iron steak , which they raved about . and the dessert .. omg ... the dessert was delicious ! ! ! as for the rest of the restaurant experience it was as sweet as the cotton candy brought to our table before our dessert . the only other thing .... it was cold , so ladies bring a little cardigan or wrap , and what a weird location for a fabulous restaurant ...
0	i love trams . i love unearthing old tram lines in glasgow and edinburgh , i love the pace of them , i love how they still carry an air of superior public transport status from the bygone days of the `` trolley buses '' . most european cities and blackpool all have trams , so edinburgh ( who have n't had trams since 1956 ) have decided to bring 'em back . in theory , this is a wonderful idea , adding another dimension to edinburgh 's reliable , clean city transport and increasing interest from tram fanatics . unfortunately , the reality is grim . this is where things get grizzly , and i will appear grumpy . but i hope you see my point ! the trams are taking ages , which is causing upheaveal , disruption and general grievances to the people of edinburgh . there seems to have been a hold up on production , and the project is taking an era to complete . they have quoted 2012 and i realise there has been a dip caused by the global recession , but it 's still a bit irritating . moreover , and it really , really saddens me to think this way , but considering the project is funded by the city council and the scottish government , then surely at the moment there are better ways in which we could be spending our money ? politics and reviewing should rarely if ever entwine , but i feel that we have too many cuts to deal with at this moment in time to pour money into something that 's surplus to requirements . i do n't know as much about the project as maybe some locals do so please enlighten me if i am wrong . but buses travel to most areas in the city , there are trains , and at the moment scotland is being faced with some serious blows that may send us spiralling back to the not-so-hallowed days of thatcher . time will tell on that one , but i digress ... ... so much to my dismay , i am inclined to feel that at this point in time , this project is frivilous . there are cuts here , there and everywhere that inevitably will affect not only museums and attractions that we enjoy , but also severely threaten the physical , mental and financial health of the country at large . admittedly cameron is thatcher in a skirt , so although i am expecting to see a second blow thrown from the next hammer of the scots i do n't know if his reign will be as severe as the bitter economic winter that she brought in behind her . let 's hope not , but to get back to it , i currently feel as though our money could be invested into something safer and more necessary for this point in time rather than on a project that , although wonderful in its own way , is perhaps the least of edinbugh 's worries in the years to come . for someone who did n't want to bring politics into it , i 've not done a very good job at keeping them out . oops . no offence is intended and debate is welcomed should you disagree with my opinion - it is just an opinion , after all .
0	got a burrito and they had to change tortillas because there was so much liquid in it . i even had to wring it out when i sat down . ultimately i could n't eat the soaked and soggy concoction . so disappointed because i like chipotle
1	this fry 's has some exceptional people working here . and now , for the rest of the story ... wherever possible , fry 's gas stations have been sprouting up throughout the valley . this one opened about six months ago . after having dinner last night at red house ( excellent as usual , btw ) , i noticed i was near empty . as i came in i also realized it was the third of the month . since we had n't gone shopping yet that means we did n't have any points . no matter i thought , we needed gas . the attendant , joe t was outside helping folks . when was the last time your saw a gas station attendant outside helping people ? joe does a lot of that i found out . one woman who had a rental vw , could n't figure out how to open her tank . she asked for my assistance , but joe had fixed it by the time i walked over . i on the other hand was had problems getting the pump to accept my card . seems , it does n't matter if you do not have any points . unless you input your fry 's card , the machine does n't work . d'oh ! well . joe came by and fixed it . so we got to chatting . he believes the more time he 's spends behind the glass ; the less time he can be outside helping customers ! he told me he likes being able to help folks . feels that 's the real job , his job . wow ! so four stars to joe t for understanding the service end of the pump , and fry 's for hiring him . nice !
0	of all the hotels in vegas this one smelled worse than any of the other ones i have been in . the lobby was disgusting , the air just reeked . stay elsewhere ...
1	first , i have to thank mary p. for this suggestion . actually , she suggested the location in north las vegas . but still glad i came here . i was staying at the hard rock and wanted some sushi . had hamada 's 2 nights prior ( see review ) and it was horrible . had to redeem myself . service : tons of staff to the point that you will always have someone at your needs . good job team kaizen . now for the food . tried their spicy tuna , chicken katsu w/brown rice , baked salmon , and caterpillar roll . all were tasty , fresh , not fishy , and made to order . my co-worker had a special roll created exactly how he wanted it . always good when they can improvise . ca n't wait to try the location in north las vegas . only issue with this place is that they lack ayce . but they stated they were better than the north location . we 'll see , i will be the judge
0	this is decent , if americanized noodle cuisine . lot of sugar in everything . cool bar and unfinished concrete urban decor . nice to drop by if in the neighborhood , but real asian food is just right down central without any pretense of fusion . also , fusion .
0	i truly believe my eyes were hungrier than my stomach . while my husband and i would be open to trying other buffets the one reason we keep coming back is their king crab legs , already split down the middle for your taking . when you 're paying a bit over $ 80 for two who really wants to work at getting to their food ? i sure do n't . i swear one of the reasons we came to lv was to defeat the buffets . the buffet at the wynn defeated us this time around . i 'm still trying to figure out if it 's their food options that have slipped somwhat , while plentiful , or if i 'm getting older and ca n't eat like i use to in my late teens-early twenties . damn .
1	every time i go to this place , my taste buds thank me . i have tried many different meals , and each one has its own great flavor . i have also tried some of their desserts and drinks , totally tasty . people are super friendly there and it has a nice clean fresh atmosphere . even my meat-eating husband complimented the faux-meat dish he got . i wish they got more business though , the parking lot is almost always empty when i go . the hours are a bit weird but i can understand it if they do n't get customers all day long . if i could afford to eat out every day , i 'd go to this place for sure . there are so many things still on the menu that i want to try .
0	i was really hoping this place would have sparked me to write a glowing review . i had never been before and it came highly recommended by co-workers . we rolled in as they opened at 7:00am , just as what appeared to be the gardner was rolling up the extension cord from his leaf blower . he told us we could sit anywhere . we opted for outside seating , as the september morning weather was cooperating . drink orders were slow , as was the service in general . the food was delivered by , none other than , the `` gardner . '' a jack of all trades it would seem . the eggs , hash browns and sausage were all very good . the pancakes , on the other hand , were not . they were chewy and it seemed as though they must have been done before the rest of the meal and then reheated . the coffee was decent and the atmosphere had a cool coffee shop flare to it . the slow service and chewy hot cakes prevent a four star rating . there is better food and better coffee elsewhere , but it 's worth a trip just for the sake of saying you 've been there .
0	i really did n't expect much from this place as it seems to be really a bar before restaurant . i also did get a groupon deal for $ 30 for $ 15 which eased the pain . food was blah and boring . my wife had fajitas which had old looking tortillas and entirely too much onion . i had enchiladas which were just boring . they did have alot of outdoor seating and must systems which leans towards bar not restaurant . the staff was friendly and courteous though .
1	you know what they say .... location , location , location . it 's on the corner of an intersection within the strip mall so parking is hell and it 's right next to the ups store so that does n't help either . however , that 's the only bad things . do wish they had a drive-thru . the younger girls that work there are usually bored but that 's to be expected for a job like that . they are attentive though and the clothes always comes back clean from their central warehouse area where they actually do the dry cleaning . what 's neat is that all your preferences , and information is stored from any al phillips so you do n't have to tell them how you like your clothes done . realized this when the gal gave me a ticket after asking for my number . another neat thing is that they do have a mobile service . costs more but might need it at some point . eight pieces cost about $ 38 , which comes to a little under $ 5 a piece . a little pricier than i 've paid in other cities but as long as it 's clean , and on-time , it 's worth it .
0	only reason we stayed here was because a friend got comped room from gambling . i repeat , this is the only reason you should ever be here . we arrived at 7am and were told we could not check in until 9am , which is understandable . there were 7 of us , so we tried to book an additional room for the day until we were told it would be $ 160 for the room , and could not check in until 4pm . this was ridiculous considering the quality of the hotel , and the fact that it was a tuesday morning . ( i called circus-circus and got a rate of $ 80 ) . we ended up upgrading our comped room for the penthouse for $ 140 . the interior decorations are cheesy and dated , with a tacky `` asian '' theme . for some reason , i did not get the usual feeling of excited anticipation you get when you press the ph elevator button in a las vegas hotel . when we got off on our floor , they were undergoing renovations and there were tiles hanging off the ceiling , debris on the carpets , etc . the room itself was okay . spacious , with 2 bedrooms , a bar area , living room , and slept 7 comfortably . however , i 've seen better bathrooms in a motel 6. just a toilet and a tiny stall shower in each one . the balcony was a joke ! it was made of concrete , quite dirty and overlooked the parking lot . in the end , the service is what bothered me the most . the staff was very lazy ; we went to the concierge to ask them to send some things to our room but she was too lazy to do it so she asked us to go to our room and call down ! in addition , we wanted some hot water to make instant noodles and they wanted to charge us $ 6 . thats right , $ 6 for a thermos of hot water ! stay clear away from this place , unless you get a comped room . if that 's the case then just stick it out and spend most your time at the other hotels like we did .
0	for the price i paid i would 've expected better food and service . which of both lacked greatly . where should i start ; let 's see i had order a burger with no cheese . to my surprise my burger had cheese . keep in mind that the bun is not on top of the meat so you can clearly see if there is cheese there . before picking up the burger the server should 've noticed that it had cheese . it 's yellow/orange in color and was n't being covered . it took a long time for the food to come out and at the time we went it was n't busy . the service ; was terrible at best and probably maybe due to the server we got ; but i 'll hold the restaurant accountable since they train the people . if you plan to charge a steep price i 'd expect better service and food period .
0	how have i never been to this place before ? ! the bar itself was fantastic . the light show behind the dj who was actually really good , and the rooftop bar that was projecting a movie on a wall was a nice change of pace from most of the bars that i 've been to in the valley . overall the atmosphere was great , and even the attendant in the woman 's bathroom was nice . some of the downfalls though ... the location next to some other iffy looking bars , and the $ 10 cover .
0	multiple visits to determine consistency with the meatball parm sandwich dropped lower when on this visit , the meatballs were sliced . sorry but when expecting a meatball sandwich , slicing the meatballs changes the complete texture of the sandwich , and the bottom fell out , again ! let me know when things improve for reconsideration for the new website .
0	they recently remodeled and it looks really nice inside . they added tvs and all of there registers actually work now ( yay ! ) they hired some new people as well which seems to really be helping this place out .. it still takes forever to get your order if there busy but at least it 's only when there busy because before the new additions to the staff came along i use to go when it was almost completely dead and it would take 15 minutes for me to get my food , so i can tell that there trying but they still have a long ways to go .
0	if i could give them zero stars , i would . awful ! my car would n't start so i called the tow and he managed to get it started , but it 's been acting up so i brought it in anyways . after having my car for an entire week and not calling me once , after i 've called twice , the man on the phone told me it was ready to pick up , nothing wrong with it . when i went to pick it up , i turned it on and before i could even leave the lot , it died ! i went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it . that 's what he did . then told me it probably did n't start because it was sitting so long . then he told me `` i do n't know anything about your car '' ! i left and sure enough had trouble getting it started at my next destination , had to pump the gas pedal . yeah , that sounds like `` nothing 's wrong '' . do not bring your car here . they admittedly know nothing about cars !
0	hooters hooters hooters , very disappointing . when you think hooters you think hot chics and nice bodies . usually hooter chics are outgoing and they sit and talk and flirt . i went with my boyfriend and cousin , hello i was waiting on the waistress to be flirting with my boyfriend it never happen . it took about 15 minutes to get seated and they werent very busy . after getting seatting they took our order , i ordered the phillycheesesteak and it tasted like puke , my boyfriend ordered wings and fries the fries were a lil overdone . so after being disappointed about my boyfriend not being flirted with and not seeing nice boobies haha , there was a guy waiter that packed up his food and was extrememly nice . he was the best part of the hooters expierence . will not be going back .
0	very dated casino , staff at the check in/out desk was extreamly rude , not only to me but to several folks in line . buffet was closed during our entire stay . room was substandard . a/c did n't work in our room . we had to be moved . come on no a/c in vegas ? we were baking in our room . i 'm sure in it 's hay day this probably was `` the hot spot '' but those days have come and gone . if your just looking for a place to drop your bags and grab a shower on or near the strip this is your place . if you expect anything more try your luck some where else . you will be disappointed . you get what you pay for here . very little .
0	eat is definitely a solid addition to downtown and everything `` new and hip '' that 's happening in what use to be a crackhead filled area . i love what the chef/owner decided to do with this spot . you never would expect the beautiful attire and fresh herbs through out the restaurant considering it 's below some hood apartments . the bright orange chairs , open ( small ) kitchen , and calligraphy on the walls make you feel like you stepped into a cali spot . i was bummed that during the week it 's breakfast or lunch depending on when you arrive . i had my heart set on the spicy egg dish and the beignets . i will return for this indeed . our lunch was decent . average . nothing bad but nothing spectacular . my favorite part was the fresh avocado on my blta , and the in house chips they make . my bf 's tomato soup and grilled cheese was good , but did n't stand out . also i understand the whole `` local , fresh '' thing , but nix the organic lemonade . it was gross . needed sugar . blah . overall i was n't impressed nor disappointed . the prices were hi . for a whole in the wall on carson , $ 12 a sandwich and $ 4 a lemonade is rough . ill return in hopes that the breakfast is above average , and because i got love for the mom & pop joints . not to mention i loved seeing the chef so involved . this was the type of place i want to like , so i am looking forward to round 2 .
0	okay sammy ... we need to talk about your place . the food was okay and the service , well the service was below par to be kind . let me explain . we walked in around noon and could count all of the people in the restaurant on one hand and since the weather was awesome today `` mid 70 's and a slight breeze '' we opted to sit outside and enjoy our lunch and the weather alike . the server sat us and was kind enough to let us know that if we decided to order pizza 's it would be a little longer then normal because they just opened and the oven was not up to temp yet . that is totally understandable and i appreciate the warning . so we sat outside and decided on our order , closed the menus , finished our waters , and continued to sit . so about 15 minutes later the waiter came out and asked if we had decided , since we had plenty of time of coarse we said yes . we ordered a prosciutto asparagus pizza a kids bbq chicken pizza and i ordered a grilled chicken breast and hummus sandwich . after another 15 to 20 minute wait we received our food . the sandwich i ordered was amazing and so were the other items we ordered but the lack of service and the constant empty drinks unfortunately were to much to overlook . the three stars are for the food being good and obviously the 2 docked stars are for the service , or lack there of . if you have the hankering for sammys i would recommend the w. sahara store over this one .
0	show : * way too much nudity ! i did n't feel like it was fair that the females were topless . we do n't walk around topless normally . yet the guys get to wear a gstring . seeing guys topless is normal already . they should be be wearing a top and be bottomless . that sounds fair ! * of course there were a few funny hahaha moments but nothing that made our jaw drop and go wow . there were some acrobatic stuff but not as great as the other cirque shows that i 've seen in the past . * at one point , a girl was performing her version of an orgasm on stage on ropes in mid air . overall : * balcony area has its own bar and restroom . front viewing is the best view . not that great from the balcony . there were parts that we missed because we sat at the balcony area . staff engaged more with the audience who had floor seating . * my boyfriend and i were super bored . we 've seen many many many cirque du soleil shows before and this is by far the worst . * made me feel super uncomfortable seeing so many people naked . tips : * located in new york new york . * cash & credit card accepted . * there 's a gift shop . * just like the fair or theme parks you have that option to take pictures at the beginning of the show and you can purchase it for keepsake afterwards . * no intermissions . * 2 bar areas . this show is a love or hate type of show for many people . i would only recommend this show so you 'll be able to differentiate between what you like and dislike along with if you 'll seen all of the other shows then go . other than that i would totally skip !
0	had lunch here today with a friend . the place looks like a total hole in the wall dive but it is clean . the service was good , attentive and lots of iced tea ( one of my pet peeves ) so i ca n't complain . we both ordered sushi and it was quick and definitely tasty- but damn was it expensive ( i totally should have read reviews before going ) . for the two of us , a tea , a water and a few basic rolls , it was $ 40 . it always cheeses me when places do n't offer a good lunch special . oh well , it tasted good and did n't kill us : )
1	great food ! ! ! location , location , location ..... inside the new city center , it 's hot , overlooking everything from up top . real sexy . i had chicken parmesan .... wifey had the eggplant parmesan . some of the best parmesan 's that we 've ever had . everyone one else at the table had different pizzas and no one was disappointed . the pizzas are huge , but no one was taking any extra food to go .... we all had to do some gambling , watch the viva elvis cirque ole at aria , and a club to dj at later that night . we loved the food , the ambiance , and the overall experience . check it out for yourself !
0	confused why this location will only deliver to me sometimes . very frustrating when i only live 2 miles away . make up your mind , do you want my business or not ?
0	hands down the worst paradise bakery in arizona . i always try to give it another try because of the good location , but time and time again it highly disappoints . the food sucks , very unorganized , ran by a bunch of kids . so bad , and i love paradise bakery . dry cookies , wet bread , dirty tables , rude rude employees . avoid this place . so sad because i love paradise and like to visit others often .
0	service here sucks . i love the food still . but the service is so bad , i never want to come back . honestly . sorry zinc , ya 'll need to get new servers or some shit . awful service . awful management .
0	the food was so bland and we were very disappointed in our food . we ordered the sandwich and it had barely any meet on it and no spice or flavor at all ! this is a awful choice if you are vegetarian there are no options , i ordered vegetarian burrito and it was a flour tortilla with bland veggies and that 's it ! i was so bummed i had to spend my money ! oh ! and the prices ! ! ! ! $ 12 for my veggie burrito ! never coming here again !
0	i arrived to check in at 3pm , i was told by the front desk that they only had a studio available but it would be more money . when i explained that i had a reservation the lady again said all that she had was a studio and it would cost more money . i pulled out my confirmation ( made 2 months prior ) and she said that i could try coming back after 4pm ( their check in time ) to see if they had a room . who has a 4pm check in time ? well , i did manage to get a room in the new tower . the room number was 4329 , which deceivingly is on the second floor . the room itself was dated , but reasonably clean . the view from the window was of the first floor roof and nothing else . when i tried to log onto the internet there was zero signal so i called the front desk and was told they would get right on it and that i should expect to be able to logon soon . i called 4 times a day for the 3 nights i was there and it was never fixed . no internet ! pros : close to the las vegas convention center cons : rude front desk rude manager 4pm check in obviously they do n't care about their guest at all dated rooms dated hotel over-priced ( i paid $ 90/night with a discount ) no internet not close to the action on the strip no good bars or restaurants in hotel hopefully they will demolish the place and build a better place soon . i will never stay here again !
0	awful awful awful awful ! long wait , rude people at the front desk , and terrible massage . as a massage therapist i can offer two tips 1. if you are wanting to go to massage school find somewhere else , if you ca n't deliver on a good massage then you will never be able to build a clientele and this school does not seem to teach that ! 2. if you are looking for a student massage go somewhere else !
1	great food for a large corporate burger chain . the portions are large , their sauces are great . love the onion rings and the burgers are delicious . the prices are reasonable as well . service is on point . never have to wait too long for a refill on drinks or the bottomless fries . overall ... great place to dine .
0	i love osaka . i 've always had positive experiences here . the food is great , atmosphere is awesome and the customer service is suburb . tonight was a different story . prior to ordering , a person sitting next to me ( by the grill ) had a cockroach crawling on her arm from off of the table . after this , i will never ever eat here again . unbelievable .
0	i have heard from several people that vg has replaced rosemary 's ( respect ) as the best off-strip restaurant in town . so , i finally tried it friday . i was a bit concerned , as several yelpers had commented on the poor service . i have to agree with them . although we were seated promptly , we had to wait a good while before a server came with a drink menu . we then had to wait a good while to get our bottle of wine . although everyone was friendly , it 's like they needed a few more servers on the floor . we got a 5 piece charcuterie plate to start . the 10 year aged cheddar was great , but only had 2 small pieces . our table had 4 people , and it was not enough for everyone to really get a good taste . some other cheeses ( the blue for example ) came with a lot more on the plate . i understand that different cheeses have different prices , but i would have appreciated it had the server told us this cheddar is a small serving , so we could have ordered more or another selection . i had the porterhouses , which was okay , not great . the star of the show in my estimation was the chicken and mac n cheese that one in our party had . i will say the wine list was reasonable and diverse . i will not return unless someone else is paying . i can see why vg is popular , but i will just go to todd 's next time i want to eat well off-strip , and it certainly does not make me forget rosemary 's .
0	worst barbershop i 've ever experience do n't get your hair cut here . i went there on a friday and business was terrible the barbers are untrained and this is truly a mom and pops shop i do n't see how they 've accomplished getting a barber 's license the lady did n't even know how to edge a hairline worst place inexperienced and untrained service is exactly what i received do n't be the next .
1	this place is awesome ! everything is fresh , including the pasta . my friend and i shaqred a lasagna and a salad , we ended up getting an extra of each to bring home . with the yelp deal that 's aqvailable , it was incredibly cheap . we 're going bqck next week .
1	i really ca n't say enough about how good this place is . unfortunately they do n't pay me for reviews in money or free food . i really just want to let everyone know how good it is so they can continue to produce great food at reasonable prices . i can honestly say that i have never had anything bad here or just `` meh '' . ninos ( the owner ) has done a great job making sure the food that he puts out is the same day after day . i love this place ! if you 're sick , his soups are great for that too !
0	-- -this is for all subway locations. -- - you bastards ! ! ! why must you make it so difficult to make a simple , crappy sandwich ? this is how it goes , `` i 'd like a turkey on wheat . '' then they put on gloves and ask `` that was a what again ? '' do they only hire `` short bus '' people ? ingredients , yup they regularly screw that up too . either a huge handful of onions , or peppers , enough to make you gag , or they may give you only a single piece of onion/peppers . as if to say `` i do n't like my job , so now i 'm going to ruin your sandwich so you can have a bad day too . '' why subway why must you hassle me every time i get a sandwich ?
1	this is a belated review ! last month i was just moving to henderson and needed a mattress asap . we looked up half price mattress on yelp and caught it in the last 20 minutes it was open . christine ( i think was her name ? ) helped us out and we made our purchase and were out if there within 30 minutes . she even gave more than the 5 % yelp check- in discount . this place made buying a mattress painless !
1	i finally had a full-on meal here and i really enjoyed it ! i took my boys out prior to school starting . we went in about 6/7 on a saturday night and got seated at a four top near the bar right away . all the booths were taken . it 's a bit awkward at these tables . i do n't know why - it feels like the people in the booths are looking at you the whole time and so are the animals . but i got used to it . the food : i ordered the 6oz filet with sweet potato fries , the older boy got chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes , the younger boy got a kids cheese burger with fries . i struggled with the wine list as i was unfamiliar with the vineyards so i was searching for reviews on my phone and finally settled on a merlot ( i know , i know `` no f * * * ing merlot ! ) but it had the best reviews but then found out they were out . so i went to the bar and the bartender was awesome . she helped me find a very nice red that was n't on the list . we munched on the rolls and butter while we waited for the food . very good bread ! the food took a bit long to come out but luckily the diamondbacks game was on the big tvs . the filet looked so tiny ! but it was the right size for me , anything more i would n't have been able to finish . the meat was incredibly tender barely needed a knife . it was cooked almost perfect , i ordered medium rare and the first cut looked overcooked but it was just a small section of the meat . so either their grill needs some adjusting or the cut was n't even since the rest of the steak was a perfect red center . great simple seasoning just the way i like it - all about the meat . the sp fries were your typical sp fries , the veggies were wonderful but the presentation was lacking . i would suggest they work on that . i would also recommend they serve a small salad with the filet it 's just expected . my older boy was in heaven with the chicken fried steak and my younger loved the burger . the fries are n't as good as they used to be - just generic fries . the server was great , super friendly , a bit soft spoken but always checking on us and his other tables . got the boys refills on their drinks and water . all in all a nice meal . next i want to go back and try a burger they looked great !
0	i 'm a local and have been trying out various hotel spas over the summer . the centre for wellbeing was the most disappointing spa i went to . no spa pool ( unlike the princess , aji , etc ) the spa is actually underground so there is n't any outdoor space , unless you count the waiting area that has a glass ceiling to let light in . no menu/food and i apparently decided to go on a very bad day because the sauna was out of order on 9/25 ( which is one of the main reasons i go to a spa- i can get massages anywhere ) , my toilet did n't flush when i used it , etc . i got 4 text messages reminding me of my appointment , i think it would have been nice to get a heads up that the sauna was out of order and see if i wanted to reschedule ? for the money , this place was a huge disappointment . the facility is dated , dark and lacking . massage was average , overall experience was bad .
1	why can i say , 11 dollars and i can eat unlimited samon sashimi . it s one of the best and reasonable restaurant i ve ever been to . i personally like sashimi , so it s the right place for me and those of you who enjoy sashimi to go . the other dishes ? hmm , not so good ... but for this price and this quality of food , i ll give it full points .
0	horrible service during lunch . we orders off the lunch menu . comes with salad , which never came after 20 minutes . we got up and left . they had a 10 top preorder food before they arrived , they placed ten salads on a table that had preordered . we ordered our food before they even moved three tables together . we asked , '' where is our salads when nobody is sitting there , we ordered 20 minutes ago . '' they responded , they get their salad first since they ordered over the phone . i stay at the fairfield marriot 2 weeks out of the month . i 'll never go back and i am spreading the word that they are a week staff .
0	nearly ready for prime time . this is no falafel joint , the lebanese proprietors are obviously aiming higher . this is a full service restaurant with sparse modern decor , spot lights , artwork , and several refrigerated displays of artfully prepared foods and deserts .... when i saw the food on display i knew i had to give it a try or two . rod o. will have to take these pix , my phone is not up to par . there is no separate lunch menu and entrees are priced a little high for matthews , $ 14-17 by the time you include the `` a la carte '' rice , my guess is that they 'll have to adjust the pricing . there 's a good size patio for al fresco dining and the wait staff is very young and completely unseasoned but they try hard . they do n't offer a mixed appetizer plate ( not yet ) but they gladly obliged my request for a combination of baba ghanouj , humus , labneh and bathinjan . the presentation was picture perfect . i often buy lebneh from halal markets on n sharon amity and it tastes great , but it 's heavy and lumpy . not here , the lebneh was smooth and served at the perfect temp : cool but not refrigerator cold , very good , i only wished it was garnished with a few green olives on top -lebanese right ? the bathinjan was a very zesty salad , strong with parsley , mint onions and lemon , i could n't taste any of eggplant i expected . still , very nice for a side . the humus was smooth and almost frothy ( blenderized i suspect ) more of an observation than a criticism , but i prefer the heartier traditional way . the ganouj was really good , without any bitterness and i did n't detect any of that artificial liquid smoke so common these days , but again the consistency was a little too light . the slender kafta wrap tasted really good , all the ingredients came together gave the wrap great flavor although the kafta itself was too mild for my taste - i 'm very picky about kafta . the bakery is where this restaurant shines . the sample plate includes a cheese sambousek ( feta and haloumi in a philo pie ) i love it ! a lamb sambousek and a fatayer spinach and sumac . both tasted a treat although one time the spinach won over the lamb and another time it was the opposite . also from the bakery : a small square of pistachio baklava that i found just about perfect every time i tried it . the only fail was the turkish coffee , strangely it was bitter and weak both iows the polar opposite of what it 's meant to be , also no whiff of rosewater in it . to sum it up : a `` modern '' restaurant offering very good mediterranean cuisine in matthews .
0	dropping my review down to a single star . here 's why : came here at my suggestion for a good friend 's birthday dinner last week . her salmon dinner was ridiculously under cooked . we sent it back and another was brought out , but this should 've never happened , let alone on her birthday . it was never mentioned or offered to be refunded . tonight i dined with my children , and my daughter was halfway through her burger when i noticed it too was severely undercooked . we ordered a medium burger , and it was very raw . i felt bad that i had n't noticed it earlier , but again : it should 've never been served this raw . my son ordered the same burger and it too was raw . our waitress did remove one burger from our bill , but why not both ? both burgers were undercooked ! she did n't even pretend to care . we had a horrible , neglected dinner . i guess we were n't worthy enough to offer the dessert tray to either . i did n't want to leave a tip at all , but i did leave a crappy one . very disappointed , because i come here often and these back to back poor experiences just left me angry . i do n't know what the hell happened to this place . but two visits in one week and awful food is unacceptable . where is the accountability in the kitchen ? ! ? ! stop sending out under-cooked food ! love the rum drinks here , but we wo n't be back . just rotten . : - (
1	great local sushi spot ! love their vegas roll and cherry blossom roll . staff is very friendly . always seem on top of refills . has kind of a mini sports bar feel with a couple of tvs but without all the loudness . the prices are very reasonable as well . i recommend this spot over the other one across the street .
1	delicious ! ! my husband and i were in las vegas for a few days and purchased several groupons to try while in town . samosa factory has become one of our favorite indian places . we had a chicken samosa , chicken tikka masala , saag paneer , and plain naan . the chicken samosa was packed with flavor and very fresh ! the chicken tikka masala was not as sweet as we liked , but still fantastic . the saag paneer was more saucy than other indian places ; regardless , we really liked the dish . the service was absolutely fantastic and topped off the wonderful night . i 'd definitely recommend this place !
0	the one thing i have kept on saying while i stay at this hotel was ... you get what you pay for . we stayed for two nights at this hotel last weekend . i noticed there is plumbing problem in the bathtub . i called technician three times over the two days and guess what . no one sent anybody to our room . for 2 nights 3 days , three girls had to take shower in the bathtub that wo n't drain ever and it was nesty ! ! ! i chose this hotel for the good price and i heard it has a good view of vegas strip . i only saw some brown-back side of parking structure . hotel staff and hotel operators were not friendly and even rude . never going back to this hotel again
1	not sure why the reviews are so bad ... nice space , great patio , cheap prices , and friendly staff . the burger and fries were good too ! my only complaint is that they do n't serve the full menu at this location .
0	the worst gringo 'd out mexican joint . the rice & beans were probably their best thing on the menu ... usually i would turn back the food i did n't like for something else but gave up after eating a bite from the rest of my friends dishes . also smelled like rotting fish + bleach ? how they manage to pay their rent is what really boggles my mind . their only saving grace is the quality of customer service . poor things ca n't be held liable for this venue 's overrated kitchen staff based on the original lindo michoacan .
1	really good pizza and wing specials.very affordable.cheezy tasty pizza.appetizers good and not expensive.if your a beer drinker they make the best michelada this side of the border.highly recommended.great for family and kids
0	this place is expensive . it was a novelty to try a gordon ramsay burger , in fact i even gave this place a 2nd chance after being disappointed the first time . that 's how much i wanted to like this place . the presentation of the food was great but the flavor was just plain boring . it did n't have any unique flavor . it was just average . also , both times i visited , i asked for the burger to be cooked rare , but got medium-rare . not a deal breaker but when you are paying $ 15 for just the burger with no fries included , you expect to be able to get it cooked right . honestly , carl 's jr. , wendy 's & in & out make better burgers . each fast food joint has a unique flavor to their burgers , but gordon ramsey just refuses to take any chances . it all tastes bland even though it looks like it 's going to taste amazing . i spent over $ 55 on myself for a burger , fries , shake and beer with tip . not to mention it is hard as hell to get to this restaurant unless you are walking along the strip . you have to park behind the miracle mile shops and walk all the way through the shopping mall to get back to the strip . not an easy ordeal . i do n't recommend this place for locals . it 's clearly aimed at the impulsive tourists . nothing more than a cash grab for gordon ramsay .
1	first visit and while it was pretty slow on a sunday night , the place had a great vibe and potential . they only serve beer and wine but i think their decor and the film angle will serve them well . good luck filmbar !
0	appears to be closed . phone number not in service . went by last week & was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building .
1	this is a perfectly nice hotel . this is not the first westin i 've stayed at , but it is certainly the most resort-like . i was there for a conference , and although there were plenty of folks who were there simply to relax and have a good time , the place was big enough and nice enough that those working ( me ) could enjoy the hotel just as well as those playing . that 's a sign of a good hotel . rooms are standard westin fare , and the view was actually quite nice , especially considering you 're staying in a man-made oasis in the middle of the mojave desert . and although we were there for a conference and had a conference rate , we did also check the rack rate , and it was quite reasonable . my only complaint is that there is little to do aside from the hotel . the hilton across the lake has the benefit of being next to the `` town '' ( if you can call a few shops and restaurants a town ) , but from the westin you have to take a shuttle , which the hotel does provide for free . it makes it a little more of a burden than just walking down the shore , and sometimes you just want to get out a bit . but if you 're looking for a place that 's a lot calmer than the strip , this is a great place to get some beach/pool time in without breaking the bank or `` settling '' for a lesser hotel .
0	this sushi place is way overpriced and the sushi rolls are not that great . we stayed in the palazzo at the venetian and wanted sushi . we were disappointed . the sushi rolls are tiny and tasted mediocre . the only thing that i liked was the sashimi and the sauce that came with it . this place is not worth it .
1	this was our go to bar for a while . lots of interesting brews on tap including a few `` custom '' mixed including `` booty sweat '' which has an amazing fruity tang to it . for a bar the food is amazing . there nachos have pepperoni on them which now makes me feel my nachos have been lacking my entire life . trivia night is too loud to enjoy but a fun concept . always busy but lots of fun .
0	ahhh , the rainforest cafe . it used to be so awesome when it was it 's own company way back when , but once it was sold to landry 's , it seemed to just go down hill . the food quality went down and the prices went up . the interior of the restaurant is pretty cool though and why it got an extra star from me . it has a replica of the sky with shooting stars , a waterfall , huge trees , and different animals that come to life every so often . if you have kids , it is a really fun place to take them at least once . warning though , some animals are really loud and can scare kids if you are sitting super close , especially the gorillas . keep that in mind if you have skiddish kids . the service is pretty all over the place as well . i have been a couple of times because out of town people always want to go here ( ugh ! ) . sometimes you get amazing service and sometimes it is simply atrocious ! though i have bad luck with servers , so this is everywhere nowadays . the food is hit or miss as well . some things are great like the pasta and the appetizers . and some things are just blah , like the seafood and steaks . and of course everything is very pricy for what you actually get . so if you have kids , take them once for fun , but do n't set your bar too high .
0	do n't book them . i got an email from them saying i can book again and now they have professionals available . i thought 3rd time will be a charm . made a booking on monday 07/28 for friday 08/01 . again same thing happened . got an email from then saying they can not find a professional to clean my house and i have to reschedule . this company is a joke . come on guys . 3rd time in a row ! ! ! save your money people and do n't use them . i have posted pictures of their emails .
1	food was delicious . our party had a great time and the hibachi chef was the most entertaining , especially with children . the location is right near a movie theatre and parking was available . we were seated right away and the decor was beautiful !
0	i did not have a good experience here . firstly , it was unclear where to order . when someone finally came to help us we asked for an espresso and a v60 . a few minutes after sitting down , my espresso appeared . i found it to be quite gritty , there were a lot of coffee grounds in it . it did not taste very strong at all , which i ca n't really complain about . that 's just my preference , i understand other people prefer weaker coffee . after waiting for at least half an hour , my fiance asked the barista to put his coffee in a to go cup as we were getting quite fed up . it was not particularly busy , we were unsure why it had taken so long and it seemed a little odd to bring the two coffees at different times . my fiance found the v60 a bit on the weak side , and neither of us thought it was worth the wait . it is n't one of the most pleasant of places to sit in , balancing awkwardly on a high stool , pretty much leaning on the woman behind me . on the plus side , we are a fan of the coffee beans artisan roast sell to other establishments and have enjoyed drinking this elsewhere .
0	i came to bodega with a few pals a couple of weeks ago , and after eating at the incredible 777 in dublin i had high expectations . firstly , there 's no denying that the menu sounds great , and is a welcome change from the usual tex-mex stodge served up all over town . but , and this was really the main downfall , there just was n't enough of it . firstly , we were advised that there was only several portions of some dishes left - fair enough i guess , since they 've just opened - but when the portions arrived we were left wondering if they 'd economised to eke out what was left . i had the black bean dip to start which , whilst tasty , was ( you guessed it ) very small , and had just four ( count them - * four * ) strands of grated cheese on top . next up we ordered an assortment of tacos . firstly , i had the pulled pork and in keeping with the theme , the portion was tiny to the point where really what i could taste was the tortilla , which is a shame because the ingredients looked lovely . also , the pulled pork tacos are supposed to come with guacamole which was detectable only on very ( and i mean * very * ) close inspection , not that you could taste it . secondly i had the chicken mole , again with a disappointing single index finger-sized strip of chicken . the sticky rice was delicious but the portion was tiny , coming in a ramekin barely sufficient for one person . finally , the crocodile pie was the tastiest thing on the menu but there was n't enough to give the two portions we ordered , so we had to share ( though this was kindly comped by the waiter , who i should add was great ) . we all had a variety of items from across the menu , and everyone felt that the portions were small - one friend remarked that he left the restaurant feeling like he 'd just had a starter and we were all peckish again quite quickly . i do n't usually feel compelled to write reviews about below-par meals because it 's just part of eating out sometimes , but i 'd * really * like to see bodega succeed , and would try them again once they 've settled in a bit .
0	nice decor , great service , price was right . best hummus i 've had in long time . however , greek salad too dry and little fete cheese . gyros dry with very little sauce , but more was bought upon request .
1	gigantic menu ! everything i have tried here was tasty . a great place to go in a group , order a few dishes and share . we have had several parties here and everybody has loved it . it is also byob , another plus for parties .
1	if you are in vegas and need childcare , do n't hesitate . as a mom of a five year old , i have had great sitters sent each time i used their service . they bring fun art projects for the kids to do and i felt very safe leaving my son . the service is well run and the sitters were polite and showed up on time .
0	came to this place with high expectations , and boy did they let me down . the waiter got a little too comfortable . i order a b.l.t . burger and when i got the burger , i had already taken a few bites and realized that they forgot to add bacon duh ! ! so i got his attention and told him what had happened and his response was `` i 'll go get you some . '' i then looked at my wife and asked her if he said what i thought he said ? so he co mm es back with 2 slices of bacon . by then i was almost done with my burger . i then asked him `` are you serious ? '' and then he tells me if i wanted him to put the bacon inside my burger . i then told him to get the hell out of my sight . he treated me more as a friend than as a customer ! being that this place is in the heart of the strip in las vegas , you would think that they would have just fixed the mistake by taking my burger and given me the correct order . so sad ! i do not recommend this place ! !
0	my waitress was very efficient . she was pretty busy but she too good care of us ! i ordered the cheesy totts , they were ok. they were a little skimp on the bacon and sour cream , and although it was ok , i dont think i 'd order that again . my friend ordered the caesar salad which in our opinion had too much dressing . she ordered that to be healthy and we all know there are lots of calories in dressing . we also ordered the caramel fudge cheesecake . its was ok , the fudge on the bottom of the cheesecake was a little overwhwhelming for me . the chocolate syrup swirled on the the plate would 've been enough chocolate for me . but otherwise it was good . so i give this hooters 3 stars because it was all around ok. nothing , not the food or the service was great . in addition it was about a 35 minute wait , there were a lot of empty tables , im thinking they were short staffed and should hire more people so they can accomodate more people so the wait is in turn shorter , just a thought .
0	reduced to 3 * s. spent 30 minutes alone after having same lack of attention at lowes . i have left possibly 50 times and purchased elsewhere . what home depot will not be installing are new flooring , vanity , sink , faucet , tub , tub encloser , shower door , faucet , subflooring , drywall . guess i had on my `` shadow '' invisible ring on ?
1	went for a late dinner . i 've been a fan of this chain for years . i was surprised it was still so busy at almost 8pm ( i know , 8pm is n't late , but it is when you 're used to eating with your kids at 6 ) ! we were seated right away even though it was busy , but the service was a little on the slow side after that . that usually does n't bother me though , i see it 's busy and we were n't in a hurry . we split one meal , and they were kind enough to bring it out on separate plates . love the chicken bryan , it 's the only thing i 've ever had to eat there besides the lobster ravioli , which is also excellent .
0	parking in the mall is horrible . we went into the parking structure and was caught in a line of cars that would n't move . after 15 minutes in a traffic jam without parking , we decided to leave . and we could n't get out . half an hour later after entering the traffic nightmare , we are still unable to exit the parking lot . the folks they hired to direct traffic are not able to manage the traffic and pedestrians . my suggestion is to never come to this mall unless you can afford to spend 45 mins or more stuck in the parking traffic .
0	i think their food is great . have never been disappointed by the quality . but i do have the say , the service is somewhat lacking . i 've only been here at night , when it was dead , so i did n't have much to say about that . but then i went here during their lunch rush and it was awful . chipotle gets just as busy and i am in and out in 10 - 15 minutes flat . at smashburger it took me 40 minutes to get my salad . 40 minutes ! ? then on top of that , the lady gave me the incorrect order . i got all the way to my car and thankfully had the inkling to look before driving away . i came back and they gave me the correct order , but did n't apologize . and the woman said , `` i tried to catch you before you left . i 'm glad you came back . '' umm how hard did you try exactly ? you must 've whispered my name . i wo n't stop going here because of that , i 'll just never ever go during lunch again . i suggest you take a note from chipotle , maybe change up how you take or give the orders , because 40 minutes for a salad is absurd .
0	update : contacted the manager after the review was posted and never got a call back . if you 're in for a quick oil change they 're honest . but i 'm not a huge fan of the service . i came in , paid for a diagnostic and was told i would receive a phone call with my quote on monday . on wednesday i called to follow up and apparently someone dropped the ball on communication . thursday i called again only to be told they had a hard time reaching the dealership to get the part and i 'm better off going to the dealership directly . problems ... # 1. drop the ball on communication to the customer # 2. abandoned the customer because it was hard communicating with the dealership after a diagnosis was paid . # 3. did not request for a time extension to continue trying with dealership or any incentive for further visits as a service recovery because contacting the dealership was `` hard '' . additional edits : when i came in i complained about my tire pressure and the techs said they checked the tire pressure and it looks good . but what they failed to mention was the fact that my tires were super old and starting to crack and it 's about time i had to replace them . so now 5 days later after my visit my passenger rear tire is flat and i 'm at a new place with the manager literally pointing out at all of the cracks that you can see with the naked eye .
0	if you like paper thin walls , then this is your place ! if you like nasty breakfasts that ca n't even do eggs and hashbrowns right , then dive on in ! ( their restaurant used to be awesome until they leased it out to dupar 's . dupar 's is a slip shod tourist-trap slop house prevalent in los angeles , and they brought their crappy recipes across the cal-nev border . it 's too bad because the coffee shop in the golden gate used to be one of those `` where the locals go to eat '' ) really pay attention to this warning about the paper thin walls , because the hotel is directly adjacent to the fremont experience , which has live bands playing good music out in the street throughout the night ( 'til 2 a.m. on saturday ! ) well guess what ? you 're going to basically be in the front row for every concert if you choose to stay there . i exaggerate not , you can clearly hear the music in the hallways ; let alone the room . the people were very friendly , the rooms were clean and re-done pretty well ; and that , along with no major health violations is what saved this place from being a 1-star . if you 're like me and cheap as hell , then just go two blocks down , and there 's 4-5 hotels with the same price , and much better rooms . remember that the golden gate is in downtown las vegas , and not the strip . i do n't mind the fact that downtown is a bit seedy ; as opposed to the glamour and glitzy lights down at the strip . i just want rooms that can block out the noise . lucky for me no one was `` doing the do '' in the rooms next door , or i might have had to pay a cover charge for the audio show ! i did hear numerous conversations though , and they were clear as a bell . there 's `` quaint '' , there 's `` rustic '' , there 's `` character '' , but the golden gate hotel has n't any of these qualities .... it 's just old and outdated with wafer thin walls . avoid this . there are tons of other hotels nearby with the same price , and better walls .
1	time to update my review for this great dutch brothers location on rural & guadalupe . they are pretty busy in the mornings , but usually send out of of the incredibly friendly staff to keep the orders moving . much like i stated in my last review the staff always seems to be in a great mood whenever i come by which has made me frequent this location much more often than i used too . not sure if they drink lots of coffee while they work or they just hire really awesome people , but whatever it is it seems to work out . the added bonus is the coffee is fantastic . the only downside to this location is if there is a ton of people you ca n't really get into the parking lot from rural to place your order . this is one of the best locations on this side of the valley to get coffee . keep up the good work .
0	service is non-existent . the guy who cleans the tables needs to smile once in a while . our waitress just came once to see us . and the food was not that great .
0	this review is attributable to the first friday event that took place on april 1st 2011. sorry folks , first fridays is not for me . i went last week hoping to discover an exciting new aspect of the valley 's cultural ascendance but i left feeling totally bummed . the whole scene felt like a sort of bizarro reverse scottsdale fashion square counterculture . like day vs night , conformists vs non-conformists , capitalists vs social anarchists . i felt like i was engulfed by people trying so hard not to fit in that they somehow managed to become clones of themselves . and you know what sucks about the whole thing ? ... i 'll bet there are dozens of extremely talented young artists whose work is completely overwhelmed by sheer sensual overload of this spectacle . a perfect example would be this fantastically talented young girl singing and playing guitar . she could n't be more than 16 years old . great voice . about 35 feet away there was loud punk rock band jamming away completely drowning out our fresh faced heroine . or , was it the opposite ? maybe i was the one who was wrong and it was my youthful singer whose little amplifier managed to get in the way of an even more talented band , maybe phoenix 's version of social distortion or the misfits ? either way , i was totally disoriented ....... and bummed . i felt the same way about the conventional art on display . i made a concerted effort to find unique works , possibly a piece that really resonated with me that i would want to see on a wall in my home . instead 90 % of what i saw there reminded me of the doodles and art class projects that my friends and i used to create when our lives were devoted to playing dungeons and dragons and watching hellraiser marathons on vhs . on a side note , is it just me or do young people who devote their lives to blood , gore , pain and suffering annoy anyone else ? if these kids think life sucks now i ca n't wait to see them after they end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans only to realize that their newfound reality will be years and years of toiling away in the friendly confines of a 6 square foot gray cubicle . and compared to many third word citizens this new reality would be considered paradise . it 's that lack of perspective that i have a hard time accepting . but we all go through our phases and i wish them the best of luck . trust me , i feel horrible that i have to write a negative review . i know there is some really great stuff out there . i just could n't find it . it did n't take me long to simply give up and start drinking . fortunately we found a cool little place to drown our sorrows called `` lost leaf '' which turned out to be one of the highlights of my evening . the only way i would go back is if someone convinces me that they can show me all the hidden gems at first friday buried amongst the dark alleys and dusty , vacant lots . if that happens i would be glad to revise my review and formally apologize for not having the patience to discover these cultural treasures on my own . and before you rip me apart for not having the ability to see the true beauty of this event please understand that i have read chomsky , zinn , hitchens etc ... i spent much of my youth hobnobbing with homeless buskers at the pearl street mall in boulder . i studied marx and engels in college and i have spent entire days soaking it all in at the pompidou and musee d'orsay . and to top it off , i hand wrote `` nader '' on my presidential ballot once , and might do it again someday . so spare me the tired accusations of xenophobia and intolerance . btw ... go buffs !
1	the salon is clean and the staff is friendly . they are pretty good at pedicures and manicures . i like them . they are a nice , friendly neighborhood nail salon .
0	der laden ist im prinzip ganz ok .
1	i drive by it all the time on my way to work so last friday i stopped in . the staff was super friendly which is a stark contrast from the fast food joints i usually get iced coffee from . i ordered a ham and cheese croissant combo , the price with an iced coffee was cheaper than any fast food place and the doughnut holes ! yummy ! it has that mom and pop feel and the staff was perky !
0	i still have a soft spot in my heart for the mirage but it 's only a shadow of its former self . the pool is great though .
0	i ate here once for valentine 's day dinner . the image i gleaned from their website made it appear to be all plush pillows , flickering candles , and meditating statuettes . the internet can be so deceiving . first of all , the chic dining area they prominently display on their website , which is ( and i quote ) , `` designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist farhad elahi '' is their reserved banquet dining room , tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant . regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space , complete with standard tables and chairs . i suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner , but it was v-day and i wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit ! exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation . being adventurous- not to mention gluttonous- we pretty much ordered one of everything . the mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water , while the other pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat . the service sucked , especially considering it was v-day . this place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley ( gandhi 's and gaylord 's ) , in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine list somehow makes you less of a mediocre north indian/pakistani spot and more of a , and i quote , `` hipster hangout . '' next please .
1	delish food . our waitress , donna was fantastic . from phoenix visiting with my boyfriend . had a blast . i had the `` egg-italiano '' .
1	place is real tasty . i went to hot n juicy . i asked if they dessert . she told me to come here . place is clean and real nice inside . i tried a few flavors but i always just get vanilla . my friend got 3 scoops . i got 1. total bill was 11 bux . i told them they need to raise their prices . some of the other yelpers said it is too expensive . i dont think so . they r just too cheap or poor , either one is n't good for them !
1	amazing happy hour ! ! we stopped here on vacation on advice from someone we met at a ballgame . very glad we went . the hh deals they have are pretty awesome . our total bill was $ 30 and we had 3 sushi rolls , cucumber salad and 2 beers . not bad at all . the sushi was pretty yummy .
0	i stayed at the flamingo back in july during a short two day trip to vegas to visit some friends . i probably go to vegas about 6x/year and decided that i wanted to try a different hotel . ( i usually stayed at ti or mgm but now i 'm switching to ph ) . after a long day of flying from the midwest i finally got to the hotel and wanted to get settled before we started hitting it . the check in line was long and there were few clerks . after being called up to the desk i gave the lady my id and my conf # . she took my id and went into the back room and disappeared for literally 20 minutes . i became annoyed at this point as my reservation was already paid for so i asked a clerk who was n't busy to see what the hell was going on but she just gave me a blank stare . after waiting 25 minutes at this point the lady returns with some pygmy manager in a cheap suit . he proceeds to meekly tell me they overbooked and asked if i would be willing to stay at another harrah 's property . i told him the only place i 'd move to at this point was caesar 's . he said they can offer me a room at harrah 's and they will comp me a buffet . hahahahaha really dude ? thanks for wasting my time gfy ! i told him to give me my room key or give me a refund and i 'll call up the mgm . they gave me a room key . i felt like i was stuck at the dmv or something . the room i booked was a go suite and there was nothing sweet about it . stains everywhere , dusty , old dirty furniture , bad smell , and there was nothing new or renovated about it in my opinion . the vibe of the hotel was really lame . we did n't hang out there at all . not much of a young crowd and not much action . this was the first and last time i stayed at the flamingo . only pro : no resort fees . cons : everything else ...
1	just the best local shop you could imagine or ask for . suzanne is so helpful and interested in her customers . she quickly gets to know her regulars and makes the effort to have special events for them with glasses of fizz and previews of new stock . whether its cutesie baby gifts , lovely art work or scented candles you want , this is somewhere not to be missed !
1	i was very surprised to walk in at lunch time to see that it was not very busy at all . usually , that 's a bad sign , so i was a little worried , but i decided to try it out anyway . got the standard chips , salsa and bean dip right away , which was nice , because we ( family of 5 ) were all starving . service was fast and friendly . food was great . i liked everyone else 's dishes better than mine , though . i had tacos- one with shredded pork and one with chicken . the shells seemed just a tiny bit stale , but the filling was good . because everyone else 's dishes tasted great , i 'm thinking my `` slightly '' stale tasting tortillas were just a fluke and i will try the tacos again anyway . there was a salsa bar with a nice variety of salsa and guacamole . nice to see the guacamole did n't have an extra charge like most restaurants . while the salsa bar was clean and sanitary , i think it needs an upgrade . the bowls were set up on ice on a table and just looked sort of plain . i think they should upgrade to an actual small refrigerated salad bar and it would look much more appealing . still , it did n't stop me from going back to it twice for salsa refills . overall , i would recommend it . we had a nice dining experience .
0	slow service , expensive drinks , and food . no mints , old out dated tables and , although the manager seemed friendly it does n't make up for the fact that this place charges a lot for food that is less than average . oh wrll , probably wo n't be eating here again so , it does n't matter to me but for those of you who are thinking about it ... i say think of someplace else .
0	was very disappointed the crab legs were very small and the most disgusting part is the prime rib ! way way over cooked no taste what so ever ! if you think your gon na get your money 's worth because this is $ $ $ do n't bother and go somewhere else .
0	the food was good for the price . the service from our primary server , who was on her third day of training , was not good . it seemed like it was her first day of serving , ever ... and she acted like she was there doing a favor for someone . she was nice when she came to our table but did not have a clue . she walked by our table at least a half dozen times after our food was served and never even acknowledged us . her trainer was friendly and did what she was suppose to do ( except follow up on her trainee ) . the other two servers at the restaurant did n't seemed too interested in their work . they seemed to just go through the motions . there are plenty of tv 's , being that it is a sports bar , and every seat had a view of at least a couple of tv 's . i have found that the music at most sports bars is either perfect or loud . the music at funugyz was on the loud side , especially since about 20 % of their customers looked to be at the retirement age ( it was tuesday late afternoon - they probably have a younger crowd as it get later ) . it 's not a bad place , but it 's not the type of restaurant that i would visit again .
0	after picking up my bib packet for saturday mornings 9/11 remembrance run 9./11 k race i am running , the lady & decided to grab some mid afternoon lunch . being in the eclectic people watching mecca of the west ( also known as fremont street in las vegas ) we settled on checking out the newly remodeled plaza hotel , and our first foray into the quirky `` hash house a go go '' which just opened recently . after getting welcomed and seated we both decided to feast on this big , bad sandwich : `` indiana favorites big o'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin sandwich with onion , pickles & of course ketchup on a whole wheat bun served with your choice of side . you 'll think you 're back in indiana ! '' so when tommy our server came to take the order , we rolled with it . except i made a fatal food service customer error . i asked if i could have some * lettuce * added to the above . see , as a former hoosier , i grew up with pork tenderloin sandwiches . the staple of vfw post lunches , greasy all night diners , and fairs & festivals . except , as the hh description notes , it is not served with the 'traditional ' in combination of lettuce , tomato , and mayo . understanding this , i figured i would compromise , and make just a minor deviation . `` can i get lettuce added to mine also please ? `` , i asked . * pause * tommy : `` you want lettuce on yours also . uh , well , i can add it , except it would come as a side , so it will come as a `` side item '' , and its an additional upcharge for $ 2.00 . did you want me to do that ? '' me : ( silence while mentally calculating how two leafs of iceberg lettuce retails out to $ 2.00 in food service ) . `` um , no that 's okay , i ca n't justify that '' . good thing i did n't ask for tomato and/or mayo then . the meal came out and as described , the hammered tenderloin was huge . mind you , this is how it is depicted . mine appeared a bit differently : less fanfare in the presentation . which was still okay . with no pickle . the thing is huge . and was n't too bad taste wise . tommy was a great server . brought a refill of drink out before less than 1/4 remaining- always a gold standard . pronounced my last name on debit card spot on , which can be difficult . tommy also said `` i checked with the manager about the lettuce and she said that they could not do it without charging extra ... which i do n't agree with personally '' . so all in all , this particular server is on top of his game . the food was decent , yet not remarkable . and my bill for the sandwiches , soda , lemonade and the fries ? a staggering $ 39.00 for lunch with no adult beverages . that 's right . kind of a pricey lunch for what you get , however i guess the portion size makes up for it . with that said , the fact that you can not make a simple addition like iceberg lettuce is the reason i will not go back to hh in las vegas . i can buy an entire head of lettuce for about 99 cents . i understand restaurants making profit , and certainly addition or substitutions can cost more . 50 cents extra ? no problem , i guess . i come from an area where tomato is a seasonal item and can actually cost more off season ( i.e . 'deluxe ' on a burger ) . i guess for the same price i should have ordered the hamburger which comes 'deluxe ' instead . my point to the review/rant is that customers in restaurants often do need to make substitutions or changes out of dietary concerns , and i get that . however the server discussing it with the manager and her standing firm on that kind of a request for such a simple item is a bit out of line . i can get lettuce on by $ 1.29 bk double cheeseburger for nothing , because it is an inexpensive item . an upscale restaurant needs to have * some * flexibility to its policy on adding `` vegetables '' as a side item . had i ordered a `` side of lettuce '' , then i would expect to be charged more for it because that is known as a salad . i should have asked to trade for the pickle i never got on the sandwich instead and called it even . i do n't make a policy out of speaking to managers . the last time i did so ( calmly and as we left ) it led to a fight in the relationship , and i do n't need that hassle either . so what is one to do ? vote with my money . and that is why i will not be back to hash house a go go .
0	i had a delicious apple cider margarita . my friends told me that their margaritas have 5 shots in them , which i did n't believe because it tasted like applesauce ... until i was stumbling around about half an hour later . we shared some nachos , which were good ( but that may just have been the drunk munchies ) but the portion was too small to be worth $ 6 . they were stingy with the chips , and it was depressing to have so much cheese sauce left and no ( socially acceptable ) way to eat it . the service could have been better . the inside of the restaurant is pretty small and the waitresses were really strict about who could sit down . you could only sit at a table if you personally were eating food . you could n't even sit with your friend who ordered something unless you were eating it too . our waitress seemed like she wanted to get us out of there ( or at least away from the table ) as quickly as possible . i understand that the place is small and tables are precious , but they could have been more gracious about it . that night , there was n't a line to come inside and most people there were n't eating anyway , so we were standing around blocking the aisles with empty tables everywhere .
0	damn , those are some crazy goblets ! maybe it was bad timing but i was n't in the mood to get crazy drunk and ended up here for some vegas-style post-nuptual celebrations . the goblets looked appealing but i knew i could n't finish one on my own so the bf and i split a lollipop passion . the presentation is amazing ! large lollipops and candy necklaces sticking out of the fishbowl of a glass . they pour the liquid into the glass at your table so you get to see the dry ice fog out of the glass . very cool ! http : //su.pr/1yg4xw i ordered a sugar factory salad minus the bleu cheese and asked for candied apples on the side . it turns out , that evening they were out of candied apples anyway so i basically just had mixed greens , tomatoes , and cucumbers mixed in balsamic vinaigrette . it was large , it was good , but not worth $ 12 . perhaps the bleu cheese and candied apples makes up for how it 's priced . i also ordered a side of of roasted mushrooms . at first i thought that $ 6 per side was kinda high up there but i really wanted to `` beef '' up my simple salad . the portion for this side was huge and maybe worth the $ 6 but i also wonder who would need such a crazy amount for a side dish ? i 'm not hating though , it was tasty and mixed well with my salad . overall , my meal was mediocre but i 'd probably come back for the drinks .
1	best burger i 've ever had with excellent service to boot need i say more ? probably not but will i of course . the food here is awesome . my burger always comes out medium rare and i never have a problem not getting my toppings . i usually order the angus burger with chipotle mayo , portobello mushrooms , caramelized onions and avocado with pepper jack cheese . fat fries are a must of course and you simply have to try the awesomeness of the nutella milk shakes . the service is excellent . the food comes out after being cooked perfectly and you never feel like you 're being ignored . this place is definitely my favorite burger but it also has my favorite shake . i have tried plenty of other burger places but always make my way back to burger bar .
1	great buffet . this is a vegetarian 's haven . i took my vegetarian daughter here and everything was absolutely delicious . we both had the buffet which came with made to order garlic ( you can order it regular too ) naan bread . i love spicy food and this place satisfies that craving . i 've been to many indians restaurants in southern nevada and california and i must say this place is in the top three . i ordered the lamb vindaloo to go at an 8 heat level . i was warned by owner bobby that it would be very hot and i said i could handle it . i must say he was right ! ! it was a lively treat to the taste buds but it required some labor to get the heat down . next time i will get it at level 6. i was very impressed by the portion of the dish . in my experience indian restaurants are usually chintzy with meat portions . taj palace is very generous with their fare . i will be a frequent patron .
0	the overall food was good taste wise but my stomach was full as just after i had one naan . then i found out the reason being they added too much of ( baking ) soda in the food . in addition , the hotel staff was also not polite while talking . even if we ordered starters first everything is served at the same time . so what 's the meaning of appetizer ? that was my first time and the last time i had been to this place .
1	this place is awesome ! i walked in here and took several minutes looking at the menu . it was a difficult decision with so many great dishes to choose from . on the wall they had several specials written out , one in particular looked great which was a tomato based lamb stew . sorry i could n't remember the exact name .. i 'll tell you that i have been to many middle eastern establishments in a number of places , like san francisco , san diego , new york , seattle , etc .. and this is right up there in terms of flavor . everything tasted extremely fresh , the lamb was so tender and the flavor of the sauce was out of this world . the rice that came with the dish was not just a bowl of rice , it had various spices and almonds which brought out more flavors from the main dish . it also came with two pita 's , i had ordered some more pita to go which cost only $ 1.50 and it came with six full size pitas that i used at home in a dish i made for dinner . i gobbled up the entire plate of food and can not wait to come back to try more of their dishes . i really have to admit that the best places that i have eaten at are not the typical fancy , pretentious looking restaurants . judging from the outside only , it looks like a dump . maybe that is to keep traffic down because they have such good food ? who knows . but i do know that i will be back and look forward to the next visit . go in there with an open mind and you will not be let down . keep in mind that this is n't taco bell or chick-fil-a , so take your time with the menu and allow yourself to relax enough to enjoy this amazing cuisine .
0	that 's really funny that other people ( yelp members ) got food poisoning from this place too ! i am also in the medical field and i knew i got food poisoning . ( along with my wife ) . i called goyemon to let them know what happened to us and all they said was sorry the first time . then i called them a second time ( after i figured that my friends also got food poisoning . coincidence .... i think not ) to let them know that it was definitely from their food . they proceeded to argue with me and not let me speak to the manager . ( actually i heard them talking in the background and the manager says its not their fault ) . they advised me that i was suppose to call within 48 hours and let them know . i did but i did n't remember the lady i talked to . i really think it was a bad way for them to handle this situation.they also told me that they fly everything fresh and everything on their menu is toxic free . they tried to blame the situation on my own doing . just to let everyone know , i went on 12/16/2012 . and duk c. went on 12/21/2012 . i thought the food was amazing and delicious but unfortunately they did not own up to their mistake . i am now scared to eat from sushi joints all because of their place . i hope this post would serve as a warning to all before you attempt to eat at this establishment .
1	i 'm sitting here now as they treat my kitten . they only do cats . they love cats and are very thorough . i 'll continue to use them . very friendly . dr nancy moses was great .
1	had my boots `` re-tipped '' here . fast , friendly , and my boots look like brand new ! will be back !
1	herriott 's is one of a limited number of companies authorized by the manufacturer of my coffee grinder ( baratza ) for maintenance and upgrade . living in chicago , herriotts in champaign made sense to approach for upgrading my grinder . when contacting herriotts ' i was immediately was put in touch with the manager of their service department , larry whose customer service response was impeccable and awesome . all my questions answered by email , advice on what work should be done , on how and when to send my grinder , email notifying me of receipt , the work done and shipment back to me the whole transaction took four days until my grinder was back in my possession additionally i talked with larry about coffee and he recommended one of the herriott blends for espresso.coffee arrived with the grinder and , yes , the blend ( `` 411 '' ) does work up delicious shots of espresso . we have roasters in chicago but i am sorry that herriotts has no chicago presence . its a bit too distant for me for a casual drive : ( i have to give this company five stars based on my experience and i will be ordering from herriott 's again .
0	first of all i usually love encore , but last time i was there the service was really bad . i dont know it was because of newyears or what . first as we enter the room we saw finger nails on the table stand . i ask the concierge to clean them up and they didnt do anything about it . the housekeeping manager was to do something abput it but didint . second , i went again to the concierge to do reservations at misumi resturant . later that night when we arrived at the restaurant there was no reservation . i had my confirmation number and everything . i had to wait like 1 hour for the table , and the hostes there was rude . third . i left my passport cover in my room the day i left . i called lost and found to see if they were able to shipp it . they were very helpful.but when my passport cover arrived it was missing 100 usd ! ! i dont know but for a 5 star hotel you wouldnt think this will happen . i am going back on feb and changing hotels .
1	i hate u because i love u too much amados .. i 've ruined me .. literally . my jeans no longer fit ..
0	disappointed that i paid nearly twice as much when i went here as compared to my local cvs . i know it 's close to hard rock so they are targeting tourists but had to call corporate and send in my receipt and the latest ad so they could credit me the over charge . i 'll drive a few miles to find a cvs that charges the same price as their other stores .
0	mill ave is not bad . tempe town lake , is ok. the campus is mediocre . the academics are subpar . the students are moslty meatheads and ditzy blondes . the alumni are very b & t . the stadium is right on campus the highlight of this dump . ( i was there for the usc-asu game mot recently ) back in the day i used to come here once or twice a year to compete ( and mostly party ) with the asu wakeboarding/waterski team who hosted a big tournament during my college days . the main problem i had this time was it was so hot . i just could not get used to it . even at 8 friggin pm it was toasty . maybe i was jsut not havn a good day but for some reason i used to think asu/ ? tempe rocked but this time , not so much . im sitll heaen back to phx for spring training , though
0	it was a long time ago , so i do n't know if this has changed . it was n't just the waitrets that were scanty , it was the pints too . i know it was arizona , i know it was hot , but even by my standards the first `` pint '' went down awfully fast . so did the second , so for the third roun d , i ordered a can of something . poured it into the pint glass and the 12oz can filled the `` pint '' glass to the brim i wrote to the az equivalent of the tabc - never heard back , never heard from the tc . i hope the new one in grapevine , tx does n't mislead by calling a 12oz pour a pint . of course they wo n't - everything is bigger in texas . of course these woossy 16oz pints are shameful too . a many pint is an imperial pint at 20 oz !
1	i 've been jonesing for some korean bbq since i got here so we decided to check this plate out . this place holds its own , and the wait staff was slightly better than other bbq 's ( i 'm looking at you ssgs ) i 've been to . the side dishes were minimal , as we got fish , potatoes and radishes . i guess not every place can be like ssgs and empty out the fridge and serve 40 side dishes . we ordered honey pig combo # 2 and an order of kalbi . the bacon , prime beef and kalbi were all great . but what surprised me was how good the vegetables were ... the onion and the bean sprouts were awesome . piping hot bean sprouts was my favorite . and i 'm not gon na lie , i dipped it in the fat and leftover kalbi grease . mmmmm shots of sake were sprinkled throughout the night , so this review my be spiked with some cold sake . what can i say , sake makes me biased . i was disappointed we never got soup , but overall the place was solid . not the best i 've had , but above average for sure .
0	discovered this place about a year ago while on a search for scuppernongs . they have them during season ( late summer-early fall ) . service is always awesome and smiley . surprisingly local in focus , with some organic produce and products . large garden selection during the summer ( ornamentals , produce , hanging plants , rocks and gravel , soil , etc ) , good firewood prices in winter . pickles , relishes , hot sauces , chow chow 's here too . i come here for : jalapeno pickled eggs ( salted , rather than sweet ) , good hoop cheddar , and sick nasty butter . local eggs available year round , and produce is always cheap , tho sometimes a bit wilty . they get some killer tomatoes in around now , and price them very reasonably . all forms of payment now accepted ! hurrah !
0	we went on a weeknight . place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken . we ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so . food was luke warm at best . i would not go back .
1	mounds always has what we need for our girls , two siamese himalayans who require lid food . it was great to see these were on sale this week . mostly i want to note that molly m , the cashier , was really nice . i have n't had any bad experiences , but this mounds is clearly where lafollette and monona grove kids go to work part time after school . molly was friendly and quick and i was really thrilled by her professional and kind demeanor . i think the other cashiers could take a note from her book . she was so nice : )
0	nice to have another option in the area , and a fun one at that with the crazy layered ceasars and the weirdly , surprisingly delicious deep fried avocado . the room is warm and cozy and almost disturbingly trendy , and nicely laid out in two smaller rooms for additional intimacy . the bartender makes a tasty hot jameson chocolate if you 're looking for something sweet and cozy . a weird fit for the mile end but i 'll go with a-ok .
1	this entire process was a breeze . i was cited for an unsafe lane change and submitted my ticket . within a month , the citation was dismissed and i never had to leave the house . i was able to submit all of my information online and the communication was phenomenal . even if i still had to pay a fine , the $ 50 i paid for legal fees was worth not having to take time off of work and appear in court . i hope i never have to use this service again , but , if i do , i will be a repeat customer .
0	we stopped by after a unexpected dental procedure for my wife as she wanted something soft to eat and pancakes filled the bill . the food was o.k . but our server seemed more interested in us getting leaving . she took our order and delievered our food with no problem , then she presented us with our check without even asking if we wanted anything more . i was thinking about some desert , but with the `` hurry up and leave '' attitude , i was n't going to bother her . the sad thing is , they were not busy and i would have thought that she 'd been upselling everything so that she could increase her tip .
0	we went there on 11/22/14 for breakfest and the sign on the door said they business is closed . the landlord took repossession of the business for failure to pay rent .
1	excellent food ! ! the steak au poivre is amazing - but there is not a bad thing on the menu . the service is friendly and prompt , and the food is to die for . i 'll definitely be back next time i am in vegas .
1	let me preface this review with , i hate buffets ! my husband has dragged me to every buffet in vegas and then some . i actually enjoyed my meal at the buffet . typical buffet when it comes to selection . they had seafood , asian , greek , italian , mexican and a carving station . the difference was the flavor ! it was all delicious and much better than your average buffet experience . desserts were fresh and delicious . my only complaint was the cheese platter looked a little old . the $ 12.99 unlimited champagne/beer/wine was great too ! ! service was pleasant and i never had an empty glass !
0	there is one thing that all golfers do - change their swings - sometimes as often as every hole . i was in the midst of a swing change , and wanted to find a fairly innocuous course that would allow me some leeway on not losing to many balls . i had heard that longbow was fairly straight forward - somewhat challenging , but not a course that required several sleeves of balls . although it was in the middle of summer , i was pleasantly surprised . it was a well cared for course , the fairways were well tended , and the greens were true . even though it was kind of a desert course , the large expanses of sand were on the sides of the fairways , and even if you hit it into them , there were manageable . the staff was friendly , and very helpful . as part of the ob management , they honor the ob cards from various golf courses , so the price is very inexpensive . only two things that were out of the ordinary - ( 1 ) most of the other ob golf clubs include balls with the greens fees - longbow does not ; and ( 2 ) they do not give you keys to the carts until your tee time . this is very inconvenient for those that are older - they have to carry their bags to the practice areas . although it was n't a problem for me , i did hear several people comment on it . all in all , quite a pleasant experience . not many carries , a very nice course , with interesting , if not challenging holes ( that is , if you can keep your tee shots straight ) . plus it is near an airport , so you can constantly have planes taking off and landing over the course . since they are small planes , it is very interesting - especially the vintage planes . another plus is that there are no homes on the course . i will make a point to return - especially when i am working on swing changes .
0	not impressed with this place - they only carry a few hundred hats and the prices are a bit high - in my opinion . they also do n't have much in sales or clearance and their staff did n't seem as friendly as normal . i always stop in here because it seems like i always have some time to kill , but this time i left without a hat ! the place is well stocked , organized and clean !
0	if you want a quick place to eat and not walk through an entire hotel this is a spot that you may like , i.e . dennys quality . some gal on my swa flight recommended this place for its steak . i should have put my headphones on and toned her ass out . everything looked ok , quick service , huge portions then a giant roach heading for our feet underneath the table . thank god my husband saw its huge antenas and he stomped it out . no joke , the busboy paused to watch him do it and just kept walking on . i am terrified of bugs , but this roach was a healthy sci fi thriller type roach who ate a whole rib eye in the back before coming out to the main floor for seconds . pay the extra $ 10 and go to outback down the street !
0	came here around 9 o'clock on a saturday night . was n't too busy . the good was delicious ! bought the chicken and waffles . the plates are so big two people can share an entree . the only reason it got 3 stars was the service . we were on a double date and the other couple got their food first and they were almost finished eating by the time our food came out . it literally took an extra 15 minutes before we could eat . now of course we were n't mad at our friends for eating , but seriously us having to watch our friends eat sucks and is bad form . we did some light complaining to the waiter and he did n't even act like he cared . i would probably try this again though because it was only my first time and you ca n't always hold it against a restaurant for one instance of employee slack . so hopefully my next visit will be better .
1	my husband and i always go on a food crawl whenever we go to vegas . there are many great restaurants and we have tried some each time we go . this was a complimentary meal given to us by management . so let me get started . ambiance : the lighting and the layout of the restaurant is beautiful and very romantic . there is enough room between diners so that you are n't on top of the next party of diners . my only criticism was the music . a bit too loud and not my favorite or suitable for a nice dinner . seems all the restaurants want to be trendy here . service : the service was excellent and we never felt like they were hovering over us or like we were being ignored . very friendly and willing to make us happy . bar : all sorts of great concoctions at competitive strip pricing . they have an incredible absinthe selection ! the drinks and bartender were superb . food : do n't know where to start it was all so delicious . rolls studded with bacon and crunchy on the outside . i could eat dozens of these with herb butter . next , complimentary amuse bouch\u00e9 which was a yellow fin sashimi with sauce & scallions ( one small bite ) to get the juices going ! appetizers : wagyu beef tartare absolutely incredible served with buttery toasted brioche charred sashimi of big eye tuna not as good as the tartare but a worthy sashimi dish dinner : maine lobster mezzalunas really good with just enough sauce and great lobster flavor snake river farms new york strip by far the best steak i ever ate ! really , it was a very nice sized steak and cooked to perfection . wine reduction for the sauce and marrow delicious dessert : gianduja pave which is : hazelnut crunch/pomegranate/olive oil ice cream/basil i have never tasted anything like this . it was heaven during the course of the meal they brought us a thyme infused hot chocolate after our dinner . it was the size of a shot . it was so good ! portions on the food are generous and enough to fill you up . great wines by the glass here folks and an impressive wine list . this dinner will set you back $ 200 before the tip for two but well worth it . wines are from $ 50 to $ 1000 a bottle so if you want a bottle of wine , plan on spending some money . one of the best meals i ever had ! we will be back ! !
0	went with my boyfriend one day while on this side of town . we were both famished and ordered it to go so we could sit outside with our puppy . we started with beers , which came with an icy cold glass- a nice touch . beers were $ 3.50-4 a bottle , which is fairly reasonable . the restaurant has a quick turn over and fills up quickly . it 's interesting being able to see the cooking going on in the background , though it feels awkward standing around waiting for your order . it 's essentially a chipotle for asian food but a little fancier looking . i ordered the chile ramen with beef- essentially a lot of msg-laden egg noodles [ like pancit ] in a ponzu-mirin sauce with a little bit of beef and a few vegetables . it was n't what i had anticipated and while it filled my gaping belly , was n't something i 'd ever order again . there was hardly any beef and the whole package was essentially stuffed with noodles , a super cheap ingredient . my boyfriend got a chicken dish that was recommended by the hostess but it had very little chicken , no veggies and tons of rice . maybe it was because we ordered it to go ... i 'd eaten at other pei wei locations in town but it had been years ago , and the experience had n't excited me enough then to draw me back over . i 'd rather spend my money somewhere else and get a delicious meal as opposed to a wimpy one .
1	i love it . music is good , people ( workers and clientele ) are great , the food is the bomb . ive had the risotto which is so so good ( no meat and still amazing and light ) , also the bacon and jalapeno mac n cheese is so yummy . i love these two so much i havent even ventured to try other menu items but im sure they 're good as well . my one caveat is that the wifi is so slow . most likely because they always have a full bustling house . if they could fix this , i would be there much more often . i work from home/am mobile with work , and would love to work here more !
1	just had a really great customer service experience that prompted me to write this . my bf and i love the pizza here .. we love their concept , the freshness & flavor- have no complaints- except it 's a bit on the pricey side . last night we decided to order some for dinner . i checked their website to see that they close at 10pm . great ! ! i scheduled a pick-up for 9:30pm . turns out when i got there- they closed @ 9pm ! ! dang you inaccurate website ! ! needless to say , we were disappointed & hungry . this afternoon , to my surprise & delight i received a call from emery esparza from naked pizza . she informed me that she saw my order and had forwarded it to the web people responsible for updating their hours . she called to personally apologize for the mistake and inconvenience . she then offered to comp our order from the night before . tonight , we enjoyed a delicious , satisfying superbiotic pizza ! i have to say we 're impressed at how the situation was handled so had to share our great experience . what exceptional customer service ! it 's very sad they will be closing soon ! !
0	this is going to sound more like a ramble ... but i 'm hoping at the end you 'll get something out of it . my stomach is picky , and it did not like the egg white veggie sandwich from this place . i only live 4 mins away ... and it was so cold by the time i got home . i just ... do n't like dunkin for anything more than donuts , and their coffee is okay too . i am especially admiring the t-shirt i 've been told about that says 'friends do n't let friends drink starbucks ... when in actuality friends do n't let friends think dunkin is the best coffee -_- either way i want it . my friends think that i am a coffee snob , and i am ... but when it 's free and good-who cares ! i 'm blabbing but only because as you know i work at starbucks and i even get sick of my drinks . but i know when things taste good ... and when things taste really bad . that egg sandwich tasted ... bad .
0	you know those people who add salt to everything ? like , hey , look at these salt covered corn chips ... they look like they could use at least 6 more shakes of salt on them . do n't forget the salsa ! it probably needs more as well . do n't want to lose any precious salt when i dip the chip into it . i think that is the philosophy of pizza people . the more salt the better . that 's pretty much all i tasted . the food was so salty , my friend had four glasses of water with his meal . it was so salty , that 20 minutes later , when i saw a public drinking fountain , i about pushed my boyfriend out of the way to use it . i do n't think i 've ever been so excited to see a public water source . in case you are wondering , we all got some variation of mac & cheese . my friend raved about the mac & cheese pizza . he was so into it in fact , that he declared he would not be sharing because it just was n't worth it . how can you not be interested after a statement like that ? instead of getting it on a pizza , though , i decided to order mac & cheese the old fashioned way . i just could n't bring myself to eat it on top of a pizza . i mean , that is some serious shit . i already like food way too much . we do n't need to get morgan addicted to mac & cheese pizza . sadly , though , the mac & cheese was not very good . like i said , all i tasted was salt . my friend ended up letting me have a piece of his pizza for comparison , again , it was highly salted . just a big disappointment . nothing is a bigger turn off than overly salted food . it 's the biggest food crime out there next to putting truffle oil on everything . spread the word and stop the madness . on the bright side , service was great .
1	when it comes to your health and your body , it 's hard to find people who not only understand how the body works best , but also take the time to learn about you too . in touch chiropractic are the body providers you will find yourself comparing everyone else to , trust me , i 've done it ! from the genuine sincerity of the people who work within it 's walls to the meticulous manner in which the office is decorated , you do n't feel like you are entering a health practice at all . whether you have multiple appointments a week or one a month , when you walk into in touch chiropractic , it 's like coming home . the staff , the other patients , it 's almost like the cheers of the chiropractic world . if you want a doctor who listens to you ( and they do ) , who challenge you ( they do that too ) , but who also supports and encourages you in all facets of your life , then head on over to in touch . you 'll be glad you did !
0	i stayed at the rio with a small group of friends for one night and we wandered a bit to find this place . the menu sounded appealing and at the thought of carbs and red wine , we jumped . we were told the way would be 25-30 mins are were surprised when barely 15 mins went by and we were seated in the loudest restaurant i 've ever been in . there were five of us and we sat at a large round table and could not hear each other other across the table without shouting and making hand signals . it was ridiculous , although we made the best of it and mostly just laughed at each other trying to understand what the person next to us was saying . after asking the server to repeat what he had said six times we asked how he managed to keep say in a place so loud . he said he used to wear earplugs . i asked if people complain often , and he said yes , but the chef , this martorano guy , apparently says if people do n't like it , they can just leave . great business model . what was even stranger was the movie breaks that came on the tv . a loud , obnoxious song would be playing , and then some iconic clip from a movie would start playing and it was so , so distracting . do n't go hear if you 'd like to have a conversations with your tablemates . the service was okay , but not great . our server forgot to give us the specials menu after we asked for it and came to take our order and we reminded him of his error . he also forgot an appetizer we had ordered . who knows if he was just forgetful , or could n't hear us . the food was good , but over-priced , even for vegas . it did n't blow me away and i could get cheaper , better made food on the strip . i do n't need to pay $ 18 for a meatless entree with canned tomatoes , a leaf of basil and a few cloves of garlic . overall , i was pretty unimpressed .
1	what a delicious cake ! you never hear people rave about wedding cake but we surely heard a ton of praise from our guests . not only was our cake delicious but a part of it was also gluten free . that 's right - gluten free . thankfully , they did n't up the price astronomically . instead , diana and juan do the honest thing and just charge for the increase in ingredient cost to make the cake gluten free . i searched for so long looking for a cake i could eat . we made a wonderful investment by hiring lady diana 's cakes . on top of that , diana and juan delivered the cake at 7:30 pm so it would be the perfect temperature . they even helped the caterer cut the cake so it would be perfect . our wedding coordinator who did not know lady diana 's before could not stop telling me how amazing they were . if you are looking for a delicious cake that looks beautiful and does n't break the bank , lady diana 's is the best . they are kind , caring , generous and talented people . i ca n't wait to need to order a cake again . thanks for a great job !
1	i 've read over some of the reviews , and i feel like this place is getting a beating by my fellow yelpers . i would n't say i 'm a mediterranean food connoisseur , but i know good food . this place has good food . my fianc\u00e9 and i stumbled in there for dinner on christmas day . we had celebrated with family on christmas eve and all day christmas and we wanted to `` get away '' for some `` us '' time . we walked in and were seated right away . they were slow because everything in summerlin was closed that day and people probably figured they were too . i was surprised that they had a huge full bar , a karaoke stage , dance floor , huge projection tv , and the blue lighting made the place seem fun and festive . i could definitely see a birthday party there . anyways , we ordered the hummus and pita , lamb shank plate , and lamb gyro . everything was good . the hummus , the pita ( which we got more of at no charge ) , the lamb , the gyro was amazing , and the rice . dang that rice was good ! i am giving them 5 stars because the food was awesome . yes , the service could probably be better ( waitress had to be reminded of things , but was super nice ) , but we 're talking $ 11- $ 17 meals . it 's not an arm and a leg ... and you 're getting generous portions in a fun environment with relatively nice service . so , i would gladly , gladly have the `` okay '' service and awesome food for that price . after all , it 's all about the food is n't it ? : )
0	good food , looooooooooooong wait . be prepared to wait for a table , then wait for a drink , then wait for your food . the food and drink are good , but you 're going to wait . i 'm talking 30-45 minutes to get in , then 30-45 minutes for your food .
1	okay super delicious tuna sandwich ! it doesnt come with any veggies though and as a veggie lover i like to add tomatoes and lettuce and then it might possibly be the best tuna sandwich ever ! first time coming here i tried the earl club as well but i thought it was dry . my friend said the blt was good too but i cant ever think about anything but the tuna ! get the tuna . you wont be disappointed .
0	the cashier was very rude . i asked for a military discount and the guy did n't even give me an explanation at all . he just ignored me . i will never come to this location again .
1	yeeee 100th review ! : d anyways .. so i was `` chasing summers '' here last weekend , because what better way to visit encore beach club than to see tiesto perform ? ! surrender nightclub at night , encore beach club by day , what 's not there to love about summertime in vegas ? good party spot , good people and most definitely good music , this is one of those places that you need to party in when you 're here . the club itself is quite large , with one huge pool full of half naked people boozing , schmoozing and having a good time . the party does n't really get started till around 3pm , but even before that , it 's pretty packed . want a drink at the bar ? better get comfortable , because you 're going to be waiting for a pretty long time . my main complaint is that getting a drink at the bar was a pain in the ass , since there were just way too many people and not enough bartenders to go around . i ended up double fisting it because i did n't want to keep going back to the bar for more drinks . at least the drinks were strong ... really strong . heh . and really , where are the lockers ? there were no places to drop our stuff off , so i ended up having wallets , tickets , credit cards , ids and what-not stuffed in my purse , because i was the only person who brought one . luckily , some people were nice enough to let us put our clothes under their cabana . but besides those buzzkills , i had a great time partying here . there was plenty of room around the pool to stand , dance and sit and the music was just blasting with the bass down low . tiesto was awesome , as expected , although i wished he played some of his older hits . but that 's a different story . if you really want to make your daytime special , then this is a good place to visit . if you 're looking for a quiet and relaxing place to tan by the pool , then this is not the place . people are here to party all day , everyday and then do it all again at night time !
1	had some time to kill in vegas and called up the shop to see if they could fit in a walk in and they were great on the phone . caught a cab and found a very clean cool shop nicer than any on the tv tat shows . got a killer black and gray cross at a very good price the artist spent time to make sure to design was right and well placed . highly recommended ! only bad thing was i had to walk a few block to catch a cab cause they take forever to get down there .
1	got their hot pastrami sandwich it was amazing ! they have all sorts of deli cold cut sandwiches . but one of the employees recommended their hot pastrami . meat was juicy , full of flavor . i had them add mustard , pickles , jalapenos and that was a mouth watering flavorful sandwich . their vegetables look fresh , the place is pretty clean . staff is very friendly . i would definitely come here again .
1	this was my first time at the premium outlets in las vegas . we came here for some after christmas shopping and the stores did not disappoint . plus the sales tax is cheaper than california , so that helps too , haha . my favorite store has to be the columbia outlet . jackets galore for women . i do n't think i saw any jackets more than $ 90 in that entire store , including their snowboarding jackets . plus if you sign up for their email list you get 10 % off your entire purchase . it is a spacious outdoor mall , so in the winter it is cold .
0	5 star service my butt ! i literally saw 3 people come in and just stand in the lobby . no greeting from the owner ... nothing ! i left . will never come back or recommend .
0	atmosphere , service , food - the run down . atmosphere : allo inde has operated on stanley st. for well over two decades . the furniture , unfortunately , is probably the original stock brought in at opening ! although the tattered state of the decor is not the ultimate let-down , the place is dimly lit and somewhat airless . the dinning experience is acceptable if the place is not overly busy ; it usually is n't service : service at allo inde is passable . waiters are not very attentive , and if you require some advice on what to order , you 'll often simply get a blazing recitation of the menu - thereby leaving you more confused then ever . waiters seem to expect patrons to know what to order . food : the food at allo inde seems to aim for mediocracy and in fact seems to be made to conform to the tourists ' ideals of indian / pakistani food rather than actually being indian / pakistani food . adding insult to injury , prices are not compatible with the food 's quality and restaurants service . the place could be so much more .
0	after the change of ownership , this place is horrible now . it 's just too salty !
1	finally go to the tip top last night for dinner and had a great experience . great job with the remodel , and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private , but it is lareg enough to be fun . excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices . food was way better than expected - huge portions , excellent quality , and nicely different than the usual madtown fare . we had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles . huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade ) as well . then , thank god cause it is also big , we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese , which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance . twelve taps , good cocktails , great service and a friendly atmosphere . hope you do well tip top !
0	it 's open 24 hours and serves ok mexican food . not anything to write home about , but hits the spot when you are cruising late night for a meal . i find that there food is on the greasier side , and usually my stomach ca n't handle that . they do have some specials during the week , that make cheap meals for the family . prefer rivas mexican grill which is around the corner .
0	meh is right on for this quizno 's . mmmm ... toasty just does n't cut it when the quality of meats and veg served on the bread is below par on most visits . prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat . a lobster and seafood sub that tasted like a salt and seafood sub . cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich . the saving grace . when they have clam chowder as a soup choice , it 's actually pretty good !
0	i consistently get my orders wrong here but i kept going because i love the .99 lattes in the afternoon . after today , i wo n't even go for the cheap lattes . i placed my order in the drive through . i say , i would like an iced soy latte . the employee heard , coolata . i told her no , an iced latte with soy milk . she says ok , gives me my total which is more than i was expecting . i drive up to the window and sure enough , there is a coolata waiting for me . i tell the lady , i did not order a coolata , she misheard me , i ordered an iced latte with soy milk . the employee then proceeds to tell another worker that i ordered the coolata but was now changing my order at the window . i was infuriated because she was basically calling me a liar ! she said this with her window open and i could hear everything she said ! she moved away so i yelled to her , no , i did not order that , i just told you that . without looking at me , she closed the window and walked away . i am tired of the horrible service and honestly , there is no excuse for that . i work in customer service so i know customers can be assholes but do n't talk about them in from of their faces .
0	stopped at ms during a badger game . the staff was attentive and the beer selection was pretty good . the interior was plain and the place had zero energy . i can not say it was bad , just not a place i want to revisit .
0	first restaurant i have ever walked out of . we were greeted and seated in a timely manner , but that 's were the service stopped . we waited patiently for about 15 mins , just starring at the menu ... the place was half empty with more than enough staff to at least take our drink order . will not be coming back . walked across to bj 's , and had a a great meal !
0	dumpy dive bar with normal/nice bar prices . wtf ? scary location & parking , broken glass everywhere , homeless guy out front begging for spare change , graffiti in bathrooms , etc . beer selection nothing to get excited about either .
1	this is one of our new favorite sushi places in town . all of the rolls we have had are delicious and the staff is always very friendly . it is not the cheapest ayce , but it is still very reasonable and worth the money . they also had a great deal when we were there that for $ 4 extra on the ayce it included all you can drink draft beer which worked out great to wash down all the tasty/spicy rolls : )
0	had magic do a termite treatment on my part time home in september of 2012. treatment came with a five year warranty . am now living in the home full time and would like a re-inspection , however three attempts at contacting the company have been for naught -- my calls are not returned . now convinced the five year warranty is worth bupkus .
0	this wal-mart was converted into a supercenter a few years back but i got ta say they still do n't carry a lot of items that other `` true '' supercenters offer . and i mean a lot . i have found myself on several occasions having to drive to another wal-mart just to pick up certain things that this store should but does not carry . and to top it all off i do n't think i 've ever witnessed more than 5 or 6 cashiers on duty at any given moment . they always seem to be understaffed so if you decide to stop by be ready for at least a 5 to 10 minute wait in line depending on what time you go . ( p.s . this one does n't have self checkout lines . )
0	go for the 13.99 steak and lobster special , stay for the ... well , do n't stay . just eat and leave , cause this is tgi friday 's and the rest of las vegas is just outside your door ! servers were friendly , food was average , decor was as expected ... everything was just as expected . if you 've made the mistake of staying in vegas too long and you want to feel like you 're back at tgi 's wherever you 're from ... well , this one is here for you .
0	their `` spicy '' bison burger has no kick at all , the spicy ketchup at whataburger has more heat . only really had cheese , meat and sauce on a bun , nothing else . it 's was a very meh burger at a higher price of other really good burger places close by . all the stuff on their menu was overpriced . i 'd pass on this place .
1	i 've been wanting to try this place out for years and i finally got a chance to try it out . i had the burger with truffles and it was probably the best burger i 've ever had . it was juicy and had a great flavor on top of the earthiness of the truffles . they also give you a trio of tapenades that were very good . i ca n't wait to back and try other items on the menu . oh i forgot to mention that it has amazing view of the bellagio fountains ! !
0	having only lived in scottsdale for two weeks , i found my self here twice ! the staff is casual , knowledgable , friendly and efficient . the decor is fantastic : texture , color , light and ambiance is a true bonus to the food . it 's very laid-back `` rocker '' but inviting to all . though i would skip the `` fried chicken '' - - the flavor is nothing to write home about ( the chicken fingers were better , leaner and non-greasy compared to the fried chicken entree but it might be the house made sauce that may have saved them ) . the name of the place makes me think that the chef should up the anty on flavor.and the biscuits are def better at kfc - - even the $ 5 cheap salad is just ok. what i do highly recommend the pretzel ball and provolone cheese fondue ! yes , yes , yes . their happy hour is a noteworthy event : in the summer they have $ 4 wine coolers that are addictive ( wine , dash of liquor , soda and fruit ) and a select menu of half off goodies . plus a decent beer selection . all in all , everyone should give this place a try at least once .
0	easily the slowest and dirtiest mcdonalds i 've been to . my big breakfast order literally took 17 mins this morning when i asked to talk with the manager , he said it happens and tried to offer me a apple pie . the tables are all filthy . this is the norm for this location .
1	came here on my wedding night ! had a wonderful experience . our server valentino was great ! ! the giada cocktail was delicious ! ! ! loved the bacon dates and the pea pesto tortellini ! ! ! will be back soon ! ! !
0	this place used to be the place to stay , eat and gamble ! but its nothing like that anymore , this place is a depressing hell hole , its really gone down .
0	the family was shopping in the sunset galleria this afternoon and we encountered this new location . the owners and the representatives were very friendly and outgoing and doing the things entrepreneurs need to do to lure people in to try new things . we saw the popsicle options but all four of us opted for shakes . my son ordered the kit kat shake , my daughter the reeses peanut butter , my wife opted for one of the uk specials and i ordered the chunky money variety . my first qualm with this place is the lack of pricing available and with the ambiguity of the pricing of the specialty shakes . we did not know that there was a size option until we ordered and were asked `` what size . '' i ordered `` medium '' for all of my shakes , but was charged for the `` mucho '' size for all of them because apparently the specialty shakes are only available in the `` mucho '' size . this should have been made clear to us when ordering and the cashier should not have asked `` what size . '' the total for 4 shakes was $ 30 ! i understand that this is a novelty , but this was a bit pricey for me to make this a regular stop for me and my family . to add insult to injury , when asked to pay , the electronic tablet first asks what percentage `` tip '' to provide . i am all about rewarding good service and for tipping where appropriate ; however , given the exorbitant prices and the fact that the servers are simply combining chocolate milk and ice cream in a blenders , i do n't think a tip is warranted . now , let 's talk about the finished product . it took quite a while to get the four shakes out and there was no one in front of us after we ordered . there were 3 people making our shakes so you would think they would be able to get this out faster . finally , we received our shakes . the `` mucho '' size cup is very small and does not live up to the term . the shakes were fine , but nothing special to write about . certainly not worth the price . nielsen 's and mr. d 's custard 's products offer so much more quantity and are much better tasting . not to mention , both these options cost $ 10 less than what we paid at this place .
0	this place is cheap in price and food . very disappointed . they were busy due to 3 tour bus which i think they have a contract with . they should really control where those buses park .
0	cute place , decent food . overpriced for what you get , but that 's to be expected with most places on the strip like this . definitely go for a drink and sit outside , maybe get something sweet to eat , and enjoy .
0	wow , i 've been to a lot of subways before , but this is the worst one yet . so , i order one of their featured sandwiches ( the turkey , avocado , and spinach sandwich ) . i tell the sandwich `` artist '' exactly what i want . he puts the turkey and cheese down and when it comes time for the veggies , fails to mention that he is out of spinach . i think that was an important overlooked detail that should 've been mentioned at the beginning .. but okay . while he finishes making my sandwich , the manager , starts ringing up the order . the artist forgets that it 's a turkey , avocado , and spinach sandwich and has to add the avocado after i kindly remind him . after ringing up and paying for the order , the manager fails to add the avocado to the total and asks for additional money . i ask `` why '' , the then start begins a very rude tone . as we walked out of the place , i hear `` ... some of these people '' .. i took a deep breathe and kept walking out . never going back here again . oh , and not mention that their credit card machine was out order and the lettuce was yellow . just an absolute horrific experience .
1	i think maybe the blue zoo cocktail we had before the show , which came in collectible 24 oz . plastic containers , played a part in how we received the performance . but those drinks could not have been the only reason we had a blast at the blue man group 's updated show at the monte carlo on the las vegas strip . the show has moved from it 's old location . i 'm not sure where it was , and who cares ? this show left me laughing and feeling so positively hyped like i have n't experienced since i do n't know when . the performers in blue man group succeed at connecting with everybody in the audience without saying one word ... or uttering a single sound . by the end of a top-notch , super professional , technically savvy , not to mention `` out there '' performance , performers and audience were totally in sync with each other . the performance ranged from how smart phones and touch pads pervade everything we do , to how the brain fires synapses complete with mind blowing visuals . the whole show is full of clever social commentary to boot , including a direct jab at the casinos right outside the theater doors . all the fun ends in something akin to a rave complete with club kids , toilet paper rolls shooting through the air , and giant balls bouncing throughout the theater . there are people who do n't like this show for whatever reason ; screw them , all i know is that i was thoroughly entertained for an hour and a half laughing my ass off the whole time .
1	i 've been to uncle sam 's a couple of times and this place really has some tasty calzones . i suggest you try bbc if you are really in for a meaty goodness . if you are into cheese , you love their call me cheesy calzone . for vegetarians and guys and gals who are dieting , the veggie low cal calzones would be the perfect fill for their stomachs . and there are many other calzones and even pocket sandwiches they can offer . i like their calzones because they always have the right amount of fillings . the serving is also perfectly sized . if you want , you can eat it anytime , anywhere . thus , it is really perfect whenever i am busy or i am driving home . the ingredients are also fresh . i can taste the freshness every time i grab a bite . for the price , you 'd be glad to know that it is low . so if you really like calzones just like i do , check this place out .
1	i am very skeptical when it comes to italian food . considering i 'm first generation in the united states . i 'm originally from ny that goes with out sayin . i 've been out here for almost 8 years and one thing i have n't found was a decent italian place . my husband found a groupon for this place and figure why not try it . he knows i 'm very picky when it comes to italian food . it 's a little small place . however , excellent service . our waitress was very good . our groupon was $ 40.00 worth of food . the food was out of this world . we had mozzarella sticks , the meat lovers pizza , and 2 pasta dishes . very reasonable pricing . owner is very well mannered and came over to us . honestly i typically do n't go to a resturant twice unless i really like it . this is going to be my regular italian place . make no mistakes about that .
0	tried this pizza tonight-worst ever . no flavor at all . frozen pizza would have been better . will not be back
0	i did n't eat here , we just had one cocktail here before going to dinner . not even a specialty drink , wine and beer ... but the atmosphere is what this place is for . very sexy , and sleek and the waitresses are very attractive as well . go there to get in the mood ( whatever kinda mood you are after ! )
1	bobby copeland helped me purchase my mattress today ! it is the serenity memory foam mattress ! he made me feel like the only one in the store and i thought he was the owner . no high pressure sales , he is genuine and i loved doing business with him because he paid attention to my husband and i 's needs . thank you so much and i can not wait to purchase the base ! !
0	beware of any warranty . they will change the rules and not honor a lifetime warranty . very poor business practice .
0	i 've only used thrifty 's for a minor seam repair . they were very friendly and pretty quick . the seam repair only cost $ 2 , which is great . however , their hours say they are open until 7pm , but when i went to pick up my shirt at 6:30pm they were closed . i would definitely try them again , but i was pretty agitated that they closed earlier than their posted time .
0	this ups should not even get 1 star ... they do not know the meaning of what customer service is ... i 'm still waiting to hear back from somebody with `` authority '' to call me back ; it has now been a week ...
0	we 've eaten here in the past and not found anything with posting aboot .. try to give every place more then one chance .. just in case it was a fluke .. the chips and dips were good .. that was it .. the service was slow and un attentive .. ordered two two item combos .. chicken taco and pork tamale .. beef taco and pork tamale .. the chicken was dry .. the beef was spicier then advertised by the server .. and the tamales were just gross .. they were spongy and the pork was very grisly .. we did n't even eat half the meal .. the server never asked how it was .. just took the plates and dropped the check .. will not be returning ..
0	very nice people , cool place - the food was ok - but i must say the pies were not good , not good at all . our table had the apple , rhubarb and pecan pie slices and uniformly not one liked the pie or finished the slice . the pies are over hyped and not very good . the frozen pies from marie calendar 's or sara lee or claim jumper are much better . mind you i used to be a pastry chef and it was very sad to see the fillings and undercooked crusts and toppings nearly raw .
1	you know what ? life is good . life is really damn good . you know life is good when you can book an impromptu getaway to the encore resort . i mean , this resort is so freakin ' beautiful and comfortable , it makes you smile from ear to ear , starting at the moment you walk in . everything from the tastefully appointed casino , to the gardens , to the peacock statues , to the gorgeous bars and lounges decked out in sumptuous reds and browns -- it 's all a feast for the eyes -- more so than most vegas hotel/casinos . encore gets it ( mostly ) right from the start . even the parking is easy , with a large and spacious parking garage that 's easy to access and lands you right at the check-in desk . unfortunately , the check-in line takes a minimum of 30 minutes to get through , since the desk is perpetually understaffed . our 19th-floor `` resort suite '' room was lovely . probably the most beautiful hotel room i 've had the fortune of staying at . the living room had a magnificent strip view , which the photos do n't do justice to . the electronic shades/blinds covering the floor-to-ceiling windows and the flat-screen tv in the shower were so unnecessary ( but awesome ! ) that i felt like i was on a bravo reality show . the bedding was easily the finest , thickest , plushest bedding i 've encountered at a hotel -- and i say that as someone who 's admittedly very fussy about that sort of thing . the bathroom looked beautiful but had a few plumbing issues ( i.e. , water backing up in the shower ) . these issues were never resolved but were also never serious enough to interfere with our stay . a tip : the wynn/encore hotel bathroom give you freebie bottles of the desert bambu bath products , which are the most delicious and heavenly products you 'll encounter . steal them ! take them home ! better yet : tip a housekeeper and see if he or she will give you extra ! desert bambu is not available in any store , except for the in-house wynn/encore boutiques , where you 'll be overcharged for them . a warning : do not touch the tray of temptation . if you even displace any of the snack bar/tray items for even a few seconds , you 'll be charged $ 8 for a couple swedish fish . yes , they 're on a weight sensor . the wynn/encore will find every possible way to nickel-and-dime you , so i repeat -- do not touch the tray of temptation . rooms aside , the wynn/encore complex is superb because you never really have to leave . the pool is stunning , and it has a dedicated access elevator for hotel guests . ( there 's even a `` european pool '' if you 're into seeing twice as many exposed areolas than you would at the regular pool . ) the selection of restaurants is probably the best on the strip . ( we tried the buffet and sw steakhouse and loved both . ) for entertainment , there 's a handful of nightclubs ( xs and surrender ) as well as a dayclub ( encore beach club ) . the point is : if you get bored at encore , there 's something seriously wrong . with so many delicious hotel options on the strip , it 's often hard to choose . take it from me , though : you ca n't go wrong with the encore .
0	my sandwich was bad . so bad , that i wonder if they screwed it up . it was just a simple turkey sandwich . it was extremely dry and not tasty at all . what was supposed to make this taste like america 's best sandwich ? the bread was n't that good either . will never go back .
0	i do n't have much to say because i really just popped in here from the casino floor for a glass of wine ... which cost $ 13 . ugh . if you want the swank atmosphere , i suppose it 's ok , but if you want cheaper drinks you can find them elsewhere .
1	was in town for ces -- this place was magnificent ! the bone in ribeye was one of , if not the best , that i 've ever had . the one 'vice ' i have about this place is that they only served a sweet/chocolate bread and an olive bread . for someone who is a huge bread connoisseur was pretty disappointed that there was n't a nice crusty sourdough or even just a baguette .. their breads were disappointing . would i come back ? absolutely . the price was definately better than any of the casinos , and you do n't have to listen to the slots in the background ( +1 takes care of the bad bread )
0	i really enjoyed the set-up of the restaurant . the side room looks very authentic . the staff are nice enough , although the service is n't exactly prompt and polite . great food !
1	being a fan of simple nachos and cheese , going to nacho daddy and receiving what i would consider a 'gormet ' version of nachos . it 's quite a treat in itself . i tried this location twice with a co worker and enjoyed it both times . the first time we had ordered some take out , i ordered the nachos with buffalo and ranch sauce . it also came with breaded chicken pieces . the sauces come seperate so you can mix them to your desire , and do n't soften up the nachos on the way home . we also ordered some ceviche which tasted well . the next time going here was for a dine-in experience . the place looks nice and the staff is friendly . they looked ready to work and did everything with haste . we ordered a sweet mango chili sauce over nachos and chicken . everything came out quickly , once again , and tasted incredible . not a bad experience at all , i recommend this place if you like nachos . i 'll be back soon to check out the drink menu .
1	a little pricey but delicious ! ! we started off with the street food platter ... so delish that right there is a meal in its self ! apparently the selections vary but i believe on that day we had the biggest calamari i have seen in my life , quesadillas , and some kind of meatballs which were pretty tasty . i had the pan seared sea scallops and shrimp as my main course and it was delish ... but very salty . i love salt nom nom nom ... but those scallops were like pretty much soaked in a vat of salt and then thrown into the pan . the shrimp was delish but the scallops thumbs down . my sister had the chicken tacos and she thought they were pretty tasty as well . we told the waiter it was my sisters birthday and he brought out a piece of a piece of the four milk cake ... obviously they did n't include chocolate milk in this cake so i did n't eat any , but my sister did she said it was alright . she may have enjoyed it more if we were n't so full off of the appetizer , margaritas and main course ! overall i really liked this place and would love to try it again !
1	my first `` 6 star '' review goes to flowerama . let 's start by saying i was hesitant to choose flowerama for our wedding flowers based on their signage . yeah , i know . but lure me in ... ! however , let me tell you fellow readers , ignore the building and go in . it 's well beyond worth it . i met with ( unfortunately `` former '' manager shannon ) who had worked there forever and really knew her stuff . she was so amazingly knowledgeable ! i 'm no flower expert , but i know quality . i set up an appointment for the next week for my husband and i to sit down with her to place our order . ( lucky girl , huh ? most future spouses steer clear of assisting with flower duty ) . we arrive and she is ready to roll . has the books set at a cozy side table . now , i have odd requests . i 'm not what one would call a `` traditional '' person . we wanted to place an order for table flowers ( 3 tall per vase per table ) for 30 or so tables , and bouquets of wildflowers as a gift for all female patrons at our reception with our vows ( from a song ) tied around them . she knew everything in season- what would work , what would n't and how we could arrange them . * here comes my 6th star : i wanted 7 flowers per bouquet . well , my flower knowledge was lacking more than i thought , because this would have cost more than my dress ! so what does shannon and the flowerama staff do ? talk me down to 3 gorgeous flowers that tied up in absolute beauty with the exact look i wanted . that 's customer service , folks . i would have paid the initial amount without hesitation , as i wanted them to be full and pretty . flowerama saw my vision and made it happen saving us almost 1,700 dollars ... without me even asking how to decrease the overall cost ! that 's a `` personal '' level of service i have never seen . thank you so much for going the extra mile . every single flower was in mint condition and gave me tears . a wedding day is a big deal and i had zero stress over the breathtaking flowers they provided . talk about a company who really does care . i just called to verify information and spoke to the owner david jones to verify name information for this review . what a stand up guy who does truly have down home values and a passion for customer service . they have proven it is n't all about the money . thanks for being honest and not trying to `` make a giant profit '' off someone trying to make a day so special . for listening to what we said and making it happen . ( i will post pics when able from a different computer ) `` little girl i have found love , the kind that old folks all speak of . and no poet can dress it up with fancy words . it is patient , it is kind , it forgives and it is blind . and it can not break no matter what you 've heard '' -levi lowrey ( tied with raffia around our perfect bouquets )
0	scam alert ! ! now , i 'm kind of disappointed that my first yelp of 2010 has to be a negative one , but whatever , this place really pissed me off . according to the fine folks at merriam-webster , organic is defined as `` developing in a manner analogous to the natural growth and evolution characteristic of living organisms ; arising as a natural outgrowth '' so that 's their play . they will overcharge the shit out of you under the guise of being organic , and good for the environment , and blah blah blah . however , upon my first and penultimate experience with this place , i learned that this was not the case . i brought in 5 dresses and 1 shirt to be dry cleaned before a trip abroad over christmas . as i came to pick them up , they had 4 of my dresses and my shirt completed , and it cost over $ 70 ! ! ! ! these were not ornate , delicate , vintage , lacey dresses by any stretch of the word . cute ? absolutely ! but delicate to the point of over $ 15 per dress ? i do n't think so . if you 've been paying attention you 'll realize that one of my dresses was not returned to me . that 's because they damaged it . somehow , they caused to deep purple top color to bleed all over the grey bottom half of my dress . and this is what they said to me : `` do n't worry , this happens all the time . it 's a super easy fix ! we just throw a bunch of chemicals on it to remove the bled dye . '' hmmm , throw a bunch of `` chemicals '' on my dress to fix your errors after i am paying top dollar to have my belongings `` organically cleaned ? ? '' me thinks something is not adding up as it should ... and this is the best part , after they damaged and treated my lycra/polyester dress ( not fancy material in the slightest , ) when i came to pick it up , they had the gaul to charge me $ 12 for it . fool me once , shame on you , fool me twice , shame on me .
0	i would recommend this hotel to anyone who is on a budget . this hotel has a great location .. right in the middle of the strip . the rooms needed better lighting , i had to take the lamp shades off to accommodate . also there was duct tape holding up one of the vents and no remote for the bathroom tv either . overall this place works if your in your 20 's and you just need a place to rest your head after partying .
0	might be ok as a daycare , but definitely not for kindergarten . yes , it 's clean , yes the main teacher is caring , but .............. teachers are forced to deal with behaviorally challenged children with no real forms of discipline at their disposal , making it virtually impossible for them to teach . even the worst children are allowed to remain in the class , with no fear of expulsion until they actually hurt someone , which unfortunately my son was a victim of . in this case , the boy in question had already been kicked out of another school , and had been causing problems and disrupting the class for 3 months , but still was allowed to stay . it was n't until my son was actually punched in the face that they finally expelled this boy . because the teacher 's are forced to deal on an ongoing basis with 3 or 4 behaviorally challenged children in the classroom , they are left with virtually no time to give individualized attention to the other 20 or so kids in the class . they are far behind where the other private schools are at this point in the year ( i 'm having to hire a tutor to bring him up enough to put him in another private school ) . i 've personally witnessed other children being taunted , mimicked , made fun of , bullied , screaming , crying , and completely out of control while in the classroom . ( miss kay , the main teacher was not present during incidences , it was `` assistants '' ) i complained multiple times to the school regarding disciplinary , behavioral , and learning issues in the class and nothing gets done . honestly , your kids are better off in a public school than here .
0	my memory is a little fuzzy from this place , but i 'll try my best haha . for a fact , the margaritas are hit or miss . outside we received cards for $ 3.00 ones and they were okay , when we actually sat down for dinner my larger margarita was waaaay too salty . it tasted like they just dumped salt in the bottom of the glass ! yuck ! the only food i had was a quesadilla , and my friend had tacos that she said were also `` just okay . '' coming from southern california , it takes a lot to impress us with mexican food , but for a fun time , cheap drinks , and the possibility of meeting new friends ? ( we did ! ) ... its a fun place to check out .
1	the food is great . the employees are friendly , helpful and curteous . the place is spotless- always . you can get a great hot lunch . the menu selection varies from day to day . but it 's always very good . and they make frozen dinners you can take home and cook . everything about this place is much better than donatellis . what 's not to love ?
1	best indian good i have ever had ! i got medium spicy and i was sweating , yet i could still taste the amazing flavors . the lamb was tender and tasty . they offered multiple complimentary items , all of which were delicious . the staff was friendly and the building was clean . i thoroughly enjoyed the meal and will most definitely be going back .
0	the food was decent , the prices were alright ( for vegas ) , but the service was terrible ! if it were n't for the fact that i have moral issues with getting up and leaving without paying ( even if we have only had drinks ) i would have done it . our waiter not only left halfway through our meal ( without telling anyone ) , but even when he was there , everything ( from drink order to drink reception ) took at least 20 minutes minimum . our food order ( which was soups and appetizers ) took well over 45 minutes to come out . another thing ... my grandma ordered the tortilla soup , and it looked ( and tasted ) a lot like the texas chili . it just had tortilla strips added . i think they are more used to people who are wasted and do n't keep track of the normal details that restaurant service requires . i would never recommend this place , sober or drunk . but hey , if it 's 4:30am and no where else is serving food for your munchies , then it works .
0	eh ... i 've eaten here a number of times due to my misfortune of being stuck near the location or because visiting friends want to give it a try . that being said - i think i have had a few items in every category in hopes of not being disappointed . it never works out . the sandwiches use run-of-the-mill restaurant supply bread allowing it to be stale ( if you go later in the week ) or even completely out of the more unique variety - such as wheat . for the average price of about $ 10 i expect fresh bread . even subway makes it fresh and they change almost 50 % less . burgers are the best item on the menu ( taste wise ) , boneless wings are very small , everything is over priced but they do have some great tasting sauces ! to give the sandwich shop some credit the staff has always been great , the location is very clean and . . . well they make the food for me when i ask them to ? if you 're looking for a place for a great sandwich look no further than harvey american public house in the same shopping center .
0	i went to take my car for a repair . after describing the problem to the mechanic ( manny ) and asking him if it was possible to diagnose the cause of the problem , he was extremely rude , offensive , and condescending to me .
0	ok car wash for $ 3 bucks . do not spring for anything more than the $ 3 wash though . there is absolutely no difference . you can spend up to $ 20 for a diy car wash at this place but at the end of it you car is just as clean as those who paid $ 3 .
0	maybe it 's because i 'm accustomed to service in another city .... but i can honestly say these people took twice as long as the longest it 's ever taken to get my order ready at a chipotle . they even jumped two people in line in front of me . wowsa . edit : this also marks the first time i 've ever gotten burnt food from a chipotle . i just bit into a bit that was rock solid . not cool guys , not cool .
0	a dollarstore for rich people . they sell a lot of \u00abcossin\u00bb ( ko-sain ) . which his a quebec term ( joual ) for crap ! lot of papers , boudha statue to the expensive journal made with a leather cover . i might hear you say : yeah ! cool ! superb ! awesome ! but this is a library . in quebec , library receive subvention from the goverment to promote culture . therefore , this store as basically 50 % of the store for \u00abcossins\u00bb and the other for 40 % for books and a small section for cd and dvd . as an ex-librarian i can tell you that the biggest issue with big company like renaud bray and archambault ( which is the main competitor ) is exactly that : selling quantities before quality . they prefer servant with next to no knowledge that will execute the task over knowledgeable personal . therefore it makes it harder and harder to get small author with small quantity distributed in those library .
1	had a great experience at this kentucky fried chicken . this place always seems to be same no matter what franchise . staff was good
1	we know very little about german food ... but we do know we really enjoyed our meal last night with friends who are very particular about what they eat ... we were not rushed .. the server , kathy h. was very patient in explaining the menu , and the owner stopped by the table to be sure we were satisified ... i happily recommend this place .. it 's casual , friendly and the food is realllly good .
0	stop ! put your hands in the air . phoenix fashion week , you are under arrest . anything you say or do will be used against you . i 'm sending phoenix fashion week to the fashion slammer . i do n't know who decided to let those `` emerging designers '' into the friday night show located on the wet deck at the w scottsdale , but whoever did , committed a serious fashion crime . this state already has some of the most fashionably challenged individuals that i have ever laid my eyes on , so what really scares me is that this emerging designer friday night show furthered that poor taste in clothing disease so many arizonians suffer from . strike one , `` couture by lola '' - this entire line looked cheap and unoriginal . hardly couture . screen printed hoodies , t-shirts and leggings ? come on now . what a disgrace to madonna - whose music was playing in the background while the models walked the runway - if you want to have a 80s theme to your clothing , try doing something unique instead of mainstream and boring . madonna shocked the world , and lola rocked it to sleep . strike two , `` mary jane smokewear '' - pot themed clothing equals not a good idea . another screen printed line of clothing , and it was a smoking disaster . leave the weed themed clothing to snoop dog , please ! strike three , `` noctis threads '' - not this again ! more screen printing ? ? all of these articles of clothing were adorned with a hideous screen printed owl . hoodies , polos , polo dresses , t-shirts .... bor-ing ! when i think of emerging fashion , i think of something shocking and maybe a little off the beaten path . these designers showcased something that i could find at h & m , american apparel or the pink line from victoria 's secret . all very run of the mill and regular . this was more like a screen printing contest . aside from the actual fashion itself , this event was well orchestrated and fun , hence the 3 stars . the runway was set up so that the models walked around the pool ( i got excited because i thought they were going to set up the runway though the pool , to make the models look like they were walking on water ... but sadly , being the creative and original type of thinker that i am , i set my expectations too high ) . photographers were stationed at the end of the runway so when a runway model got to the end and posed , they were greeted with a light show of camera flashes as to give the appearance that these clothing lines were actually noteworthy . the bar line was a little lengthy but it moved quickly and the bartenders were on top of their game . the fashion week staff did an excellent job at coordinating the seating and entrance , and the timing in between shows was also perfect . in addition , i must give a big thank you to lindsey f. and yelp for providing me with these fashion week tickets , lindsey f ... you rock ! and while the fashion was so so , i really did have fun taking in the atmosphere . it was a great night out , and i always enjoy me some good old w scottsdale people watching . like the ladies room for example , it was a horrific fashion jungle of hideous strippers and scantily clad ladies sporting their best slutty pieces for the night . that was a whole other experience in itself . i did n't even bother trying to take a look at myself in the mirror , i would have had to fight the horribly clothed fashion beasts reapplying and caking on their makeup for the 20th time of the night just to take a peek at myself and maybe reapply some lip gloss . ugh . as my fashion idol , coco chanel once said , `` in order to be irreplaceable one must always be different '' - and all of the designers in this show were replaceable . just go to your local t-shirt screen printer . they could design the same thing , you 'll probably pay less and it wo n't have an ugly owl or pot leaf on it . phoenix fashion week proved that arizona is not just one but at least three to four steps behind all of the major metropolitan u.s. cities in fashion forward style . case closed . phoenix fashion week is now in jail , without any bail .
1	awesome food ! we went a month or so ago for our anniversary for a steak dinner in the dining room and came back today for happy hour in the bar . they serve my favorite onion rings with a delicious and unique asian inspired dipping sauce . of course , the steaks are also great as are their hamburgers which are only $ 7 during happy hour . i would pass on the seafood . love that they went all out with `` happy anniversary '' confetti to make celebrating such an occasion so much more special .
0	for anyone that is actually from illinois to defend this place is ridiculous . the parking is horrendous , beer and wine ? organic burgers ? hot dogs ? really ? when i saw s & s i wanted a s & s and oh what '' s up with the menu being overhead ? got a headache just from looking up to read it . walked out without ordering a thing . no thanks . i will just depend on walmart for the cans of real chili and make my own chili mac . i grew up with three of these places in my hometown and even worked at one when i was a teen . this is a total disappointment . i 'll wait til the new and real franchises come to town . i do n't care how much the investor put into this place either . if he wanted to do a half as * ed job then that 's exactly what he did too . the location of this place makes it very clear that all they wanted to cater to is the college kids . and for this old lady ( 55 years old ) the college kids can have it .
1	went here for lunch again yesterday and it was as good or even better than the first time . i had the georges special and some potato salad and both were outstanding . my mouth is watering now just thinking about it . i sure wish this place was n't 37 miles away as i 'd go back today for lunch if it were closer .
0	this review is only for the casino . it was pretty empty people wise . not much going on , and a lot of what felt like empty walls . most of the employees at the tables looked unprofessional dressed in ugly football jerseys . do n't get me wrong , i saw this at multiple casinos , but it was typically limited to a single table . not all the tables : / maybe that was why no one was playing . i 'll give this place another chance next time , the lady at the ace desk was very nice .
0	nice , friendly little indian snack joint in the university area . their cake slices are really good - amazing black forest cake ! ! tikka wraps and puffs are ok as well , not great , but good . tea and coffee are nescafe ( machine ) made and not tea/coffee powder made , which i wish they were . vegans can get egg free cakes as well .
1	when you 're in vegas , it 's hard to stand out as a restaurant because there are just so many amazing places to eat ! the competition is so great that you really have to be something to stand up against the glorious buffets , gourmet foods , and restaurants run by world famous chefs . even so , eat . blew me away ! it 's located very close to downtown vegas so is perfect for those who want to avoid the crowds on the strip for a bit or those staying in downtown . think comfort food , with a delicious twist ! a very , very delicious twist . i had the truffled egg sandwich which was by far , the most amazing sandwich i have ever had . with every bite , i just wanted to melt . i liked it so much that i did n't want the ciabatta bread to tone down any of the flavor , so i forgo the bun and ate just the inside like i would a scramble . then , i ate the bread separately because i realized that some of the flavor actually soaked inside ! the corned beef hash and cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote were not as wonderful as the truffled egg sandwich , but still were both divine . i would like to add that when eating here , i was incredibly full , so i know that i was n't enjoying my food simply because i was starving . : p
1	what a great find in chandler . rarely do you find a microbrewery that has great beer and great food . this one does . the brew meister has amazing skills and this `` hop head '' and foodie is in heaven . service is great too ! !
0	as a madison resident for just shy of a year , my partner and i have been tasting our way through various restaurants and pubs , particularly in the willy st. area . this was our first visit to cafe costa rica and will be our very last . the service was insanely slow , my drink order was incorrect , and the food was bland and cold . another couple walked out without placing a food order after nearly an hour waiting for their drinks to arrive . in the restaurant 's defense , there appeared to only be one server working , but if you ca n't handle five tables , you might consider a new profession . we were looking to try out a new neighborhood place and enjoy the outdoor seating , but we should have noticed red flags when the place was practically empty while neighboring places ( jolly bob 's and weary traveler ) were packed . we 're all about supporting our local businesses but we will never throw away 50 bucks at this place again .
0	been wanting to try taj palace for a while since it 's the closest indian restaurant to my house and i 'm obsessed with both samosa factory and mt everest from my work lunch breaks . even though it averages 4 stars here on yelp , there was always something about the reviews that made me a little tentative . well , that and the non buffet prices . what is it about indian restaurants and their dinner prices ? they always seem about $ 3- $ 4 more expensive per entree than i expect . compared to most of their lunch buffet or lunch special bargains , it drives me a little crazy to go to one for dinner and get much less food for a lot more money . this type of thinking is why my pants i just picked up from men 's wearhouse barely fit , but i digress . i ordered the veggie samosas which is one of my standards i judge any indian restaurant on , some plain naan , and goat curry spicy 7 out of 10 ( love this scale ! ) . i asked if the curry came with rice , and i was told no , but that i could do a combo of 1/2 rice and 1 naan . sure , sounds like exactly what i need . when i arrived , my total bill was $ 29 . now the curry was $ 16 and the samosas were $ 5 ( according to their website ) so i guess the naan and rice cost $ 7 or so ? ( shrug ) started with the curry over the rice first . the curry had a nice flavor , it was thick , smoky , and the spice level was perfect . on top of the rice or being sopped up with the naan ( the naan was about what i expect , which is a good thing ) , either way made me happy . the goat was tasty , but there were a lot of bones and pieces of fat and cartilage throughout which was a bit of a buzzkill . it was rare to be able to get a bite of meat without having to constantly spit out a small chunk of something ( best visual ever , i know ) . i actually would have ultimately preferred it with just the curry sauce by the end of my plate . the samosas were very large and perfectly shaped with a great flaky crust . honestly it almost seemed a little too perfectly made which had me wondering if it was homemade or not ( i have no way of knowing honestly , it 's quite possible it is ) . they tasted fine on the inside , but i found the outside to be overly salt or peppered or both . i 'd honestly never had a samosa with so much seasoning on the outside of it , and my fingers were covered in spice whenever i 'd pick it up to eat it which i was n't used to .. the green sauce it came with was good , was n't so much a fan of the red . overall a good version , though i prefer factory 's or mt everest 's . final conclusion is that i enjoyed my meal overall , though i would n't exactly say it was worth the price i paid in total . i did get leftovers out of it which softened the blow a little . i think i 'll stick with samosa factory and mt everest to satisfy my indian cravings , though if i 'm ever in a dire need for some curry in henderson ( it happens . it definitely happens ) taj palace warrants some consideration .
0	this was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated cafe zinho . parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy saturday night ; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park . the greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table , it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by , which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery . no other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived , 6:45 p. m. the online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree , but there was no such entree on this night . there was only one non-meat item on the small menu , ravioli . our gracious server , ramon , said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it , and that was what we did . the restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages , a nice convenience and savings for the diner . a small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter . my mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion , served piping hot , which was great , but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces . i would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup . all of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty , average size portions . all were served with a small amount of good , fresh vegetables . it would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server : `` chicken maputo roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce '' . does the average diner know what `` maputo '' and `` piri piri '' are ? the lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing , served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream . it was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories . the gracious owner , tony pais , stopped at our table for a moment to greet us , a nice touch , and there were quality checks by a manager and ramon . i noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here , individuals whom i was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant . apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town . the rest rooms are small , one-person facilities , naturally . an unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks , this for a tariff of $ 148 plus gratuity . it is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an automatic teller machine on site . i imagine less than 1 % of expensive restaurants today are cash only . cafe zinho is a highly flawed restaurant , demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine . if one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner , the diner might enjoy it : not us . i posted comments about the restaurant at its facebook page , in which i noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable , and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $ 148 check . an individual identifying himself as the manager , who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone , initially demonstrated rage , posting a message that i can go to the oiive garden the next time i dine out . he later added with similar condescension that i can use a coupon and a credit card at the olive garden . later , he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments ... along with mine . he ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense . i thanked him for the offer , but told him that one experience at cafe zinho was enough . i had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman .
0	i bought a groupon for this place and drove over there ( not close for me ) and was worried when i arrived . from outside this place looks sketchy at best . i went inside anyway because i like adventure . the girl had me sit down in a rolling office chair and proceeded to grab a dirty looking home pedicure tub to do my pedicure . i faked an emergency phone call and left . my feet thanked me . ps . the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
0	i was very disappointed with them . i have been a loyal customer since the first location for about two years . yesterday , i came to the scottsdale location , i started inquiring about a device i always wanted but it is kind of expensive . this guy chris was very condescending , he pretty much ignored me like i was nobody . he continue talking to this group of girls , i will take my business elsewhere .
1	we came here to seek shelter from the overpriced-over the top vegas strip ! the peppermill is truly a nice oasis . great decor , indoor trees , friendly staff , and affordable meals makes this place stand out . being just north of the now main drag of las vegas boulevard , its definitley within striking distance and easy to get to . most dishes here are under $ 15 and the portion size are good . the fact that its open 24 hours immediately made this place one of my favorite places on the strip . i got the sampler which is quite similar to the denny 's sampler but tasty ! chicken strips , mozzarella sticks , onion rings .... yup , its a diet nightmare . the onion rings were quite notable . the crowd is also a mixed bag of locals , tourists and vegas characters . highly recommend this place when you are tired of blowing your cash on the strip !
1	every time i visit montreal i always make it a point to get a smoke meat sandwich here . still under $ 10 gets you a good sandwich was a good amount of meat . and you can ask them to cut the meat just the way you like .
0	we did n't eat here . we waited a sec for a table in the rapidly emptying restaurant at 10:00 and they stuck us in a corner . why pay for a view that you wo n't see ? we left and went down to mon ami gabi instead .
0	smoothies tasted great but their customer service sucks ! ! ! omg ! ! ! i usu . never bother to make angry reviews but damn , i was just so pissed at this location . me & my cousin went in there the other day and some as $ h0le looking teenager walks to the register and just stands there looking at us like we were inconveniencing by waiting for our order ... i 'm not exaggerating here folks and i know i 'm a polite customer so i didnt say anything ... let it go ... i still didnt know what to order so i heard his stupid ass sighed like damn i was taking forever . this fcker didnt even bother to greet us either , not one hello or even a smile ! ! ! that 's fine and all but he looked so bored and his co-worker , some other teen aged girl looked rude too . thank god the smoothies were good , otherwise i would have been more pissd . i will not come back to this location , w/ their attitudes like that , they can go fck themselves .
1	i chose to have my birthday dinner at ocean prime this year , and what a wonderful dinner it ended up being ! we arrived hungry and agreed to start with the colossal shrimp in a tabasco cream sauce . it was amazing . it came with a few slices of cheezy bread that was perfect for sopping up the sauce . i had the awesome twin lobster tails with asparagus for my entree and my man got the shrimp pasta . we also split the jalapeno scalloped potatoes . wow . all i can say is that it was the best meal i have had in some time . our server was great , the food incredible , and the atmosphere upscale but not pretentious at all . and the prices are pretty good . we were also given a complementary dessert for my birthday that we would have never ordered otherwise ( too full ! ) but managed to inhale anyway . the creme brulee was a large portion compared to most places , and was excellent . i 'm now looking forward to returning when my mom comes to visit later this month !
1	this place is a true gem and i feel so lucky to have the only portuguese restaurant in vegas so close to me ! i recently returned from a trip around portugal and vila algarve is truly authentic . we had the half chorizo , shrimp tails , bacalhau , verde soup , dolmades and calamari curry . everything was spectacular but the chorizo and bacalhau stand out . the owner and her family are genuine and provide a european restaurant experience . i 'm even more excited by the fact they offer douro valley red wine . i do wish they had some by the glass but i 'll gladly polish off a bottle . i 'm hoping they 'll incorporate a late night happy hour , as i think this could be an industry hot spot .
0	it 's never my intention to harm a local business , but this place blows . nothing is current . ( unless you want faded black business casual pants . ) again , discounts are n't done by date , which is sad considering it 's the best way to keep the merchandise moving and in season . the owner is very nice and positive . maybe you can help her out by consigning good items with her ?
1	i 'm new to las vegas and after spending months of searching for a great salon , i have finally found a winner ! brianna is the best ! i am usually afraid of dying my hair or cutting it because i have had horrible experiences in the past but she did exactly what i wanted and 1000x better ! plus , the products they use are amazing . i typically do not buy my hair care products directly from the salon but they use a line called phyto and it did wonders to what i thought was irreparable hair . so , of course i had to have it so my hair always looks like i just came from the salon ! i definitely recommend this salon ! best in vegas !
1	i just went here for pain when i pee a little pricey but worth it the front desk lady was super nice the pa was really nice and i got meds to help with the pain for 15 a bottle !
0	went with co-worker to grab him some lunch . i got just a soda , but his lunch was made fast and fresh . very friendly workers there . pretty accessible location . decent place .
0	yuck . the other reviews are on point with this place . i purchased 6 cupcakes the other day and brought them home to share with the fam . i got red velvet , lemon , triple chocolate , fudge , peanut butter and a malted milk cupcake . first things first these things do not travel well . it 's probably because the huge gobs of frosting they put on the cakes . at least 2 of them had tipped over in the box . next the cakes were dry ! ! ! and flavorless ! i love a moist cake and these were not moist at all . and the flavors all tasted the same . now for the frosting .... they use a ton of frosting on each cake and the frosting does not taste good . the red velvet cake had a white frosting which i assumed would be cream cheese but it was n't it was just a flavorless white frosting . it was n't even vanilla flavored . the chocolate frosting taste just like betty crocker canned chocolate frosting which i like but not when i 'm paying $ 3+ for a cupcake ! ! i ca n't even finish this review because i 'm so disappointed with the quality of the product .
0	this is the first time at this location it 's a cute little resturant the foods not bad . it 's a bit pricey for food that is just ok the portions are good size and the pies are great but i 'd go here just for the pies not to eat anything else .
0	in the mood for pizza and salad so decided to try ephesus pizza . i was given a menu from the hotel . first the plus - large menu with unique items ( gyro meat on a pizza ) . now the important stuff : lots of choices for their pizzas . their crust has medium thickness . the taste : ok but nothing great . the salad was ok. delivery service was very quick . will not be a repeat customer .
0	i had an office address only not the actual office but i never got any mail there except once and i had to call them and email them to find out if i got a package then they finally said `` yeh it came yesterday . '' i had called the day before they claimed they would let me know by email or call me . in anycase . these people are crooks . they advertise on craigslist and they get you to come down . if you 're a new start up or blogger , writer , small business it seems like a cost effective idea . you can even go there sometimes and work . however , that is not the case . they charge you for odd things . they go up on the price normal mail box price is about $ 50 -70 depending on address . but then i noticed they had it where i could probably rent office space daily if i wanted to go down there etc . but then i realized they had another office in century city that was charging $ 49 and that 's pretty cheap . they were charging me $ 100 but the better office was $ 49 . so i decided i wanted to quit or renegotiate . but they did n't want any part of that . they are now harassing me . but i just want people to know these people seem like they are easy at first but once you sign up . they will over charge you my mailbox fee went from 99 a month to 100 , then the last i checked it was 138 and i asked what that was for . no answer . now they want to charge me like 1000 dollars for not paying them for one month . lol that 's hilarious . i just laughed at them and asked them what will you do to me f i do n't pay ? how did you come up with this ridiculous amount . i do n't understand why we all do n't class action sue these nuts they are all over but if you have plenty of money and do n't care about being over charged and et . see logically people like craigslist and i 've been able to use craiglist to buy things , sell some items , furniture , and et . most of the time people can work things out there are some crooks on there but for the most part i thought they were trying to simply fill up some office space . not the case they are crooks . they 've even charged me before for two months and i paid it but it was an overcharge and i know i only owed them for one month . they are crooks do not use them . liars , crooks , and they overcharge you like crazy . the letters they send out are very rude and demanding . they claime they are going to sue me .
1	this is my go to carwash place when i just want the outside done , love the towel drying .
0	i have been to this place a few times , i thought they had the best crawfish in vegas ... as my bf and i kept going we noticed that the crawfish is not fresh at all . 4 out of the 7 times we 've been there some of the crawfish were black , now you know when it 's not good at all when you open the crawfish and find black juice not just one crawfish but a few . do n't get me wrong their flavors are all there ! you have to try the hot and juicy seasoning which is a mixture of everything . when they mean spicy they really mean it ! the have other items on the menu for those who do not eat seafood like chicken wings and chicken nuggets . service is okay , a few times they forgot my order and never checked up on us to see why we have n't all received our food . not only that they never even apologized . make sure the printer in the back is working ! oh yeah , parking is a pain in the butt when it 's busy !
0	i am reviewing this place solely on the saturday night dance night , cheap thrills . i have yet to eat here and really do want to try it out . first off , the beer selection is awesome ! i had 3 dunkels in big barrel glasses , the price is very fair and the beer was great ! the bartenders are very fast even when the bar is jam packed ! the dance/music portion is highly disappointing . cheap thrills is supposed to be a combination of shake dj 's and party foul ... i was excited , as i love dj william reed and jared allen . unfortunately william never took to the decks , and i was there from 11 till 2ish . the kids who were up there played terrible trance techno type stuff that was undancable and i felt like i was at a rave in someones basement and needed a pair of glow sticks . i was really looking forward to hearing some old shake music in the mix , it never happened . maybe this dance night is no longer a collaboration of the two , as william never spun that night . i dunno . i should add , that my taste in music is pretty terrible . give me some q lazzarus , yaz , motely crue , or prince and i am a happy girl . i most likely wont be going back for this dance night , but i will be going back to try the food out and have a few more dunkels
1	i 'm an avid sneaker collector , but not an avid runner . my gym routines and athletics traditionally have n't been built around running long distances . they 've usually involved lifting weights and a variety of cardio machines and/or sports like pickup basketball , boxing or tennis . but since charlotte weather is usually great i decided that i was going to incorporate running and outdoor running specifically . i decided to bypass the usual sneaker spots ( footlocker , finishline , dicks , sports authority , champs ) to get running shoes and advice specifically for me . run for life is a great place for that . here the sales associates are all avid runners themselves and really are like consultants . they 're also very friendly and want to build a bit of a relationship with you , which is great . they encourage you to try shoes and do n't mind if you try several pairs on several sizes for the perfect pair . they also watch you run around in the store to see your running stride and determine the right shoe . they 're very good at what they do . i 've purchased two pairs there since moving to charlotte last year . their prices are consistent with retail and they do have sales from time to time . my only knock on run for life is their selection . they do have shoes for every type of runner , but do n't always have the latest styles or colors . i remember coming in a couple of times with the intention of buying a particular shoe that i had expected them to have , only to find that they still only carried the older model . but i also understand that they operate differently than some of the bigger chains like the ones mentioned above and in order to stay in business they sometimes have to pick and choose what shoes they carry . which is why i definitely recommend run for life . you might find better selections at the other places , but their sizing and running expertise is top notch .
1	cheap , quick , healthy and spicy ! i 've been a devotee of sree 's foods for almost a decade . when my employer moved to the north shore a few years ago i 've missed my lunch hour visits to sree 's terribly . i now brave pittsburgh 's streets on my bike for my favorite 'fast food ' . if one is accustomed to the oily , creamy , high calorie meals one typically finds at indian restaurants , sree 's will take some getting used to . mrs sree 's low-oil vegan dishes with brown rice and whole wheat bread are the healthiest options one could imagine for just $ 6 . i can get 2-3 tasty meals out of one visit !
0	this was my third attempt in 13 years to get a decent mexican dish from this place . failed again . overpriced , the worst mexican food ever , my chimichanga was more like a burrito , not fried enough at all . when they are busy , the food is clearly uncooked and rushed . for the money , taco bell is way better . what does that tell you ? if you want great mexican food , head to south tucson and 4th and 6th avenues just a couple of miles off i-10 , take the 22nd street exit then go left ( east ) . macayo 's hands down has the best mexican food .
0	each time i go to greenbush , i never know what to expect . i went once on a monday afternoon and there were hardly any doughnuts - no glazed doughnuts at all . the worker told me it was because they got a late start on mondays . i went last friday night around 9:30 pm and had 3 of the best doughnuts i 'd ever had . i went today ( tuesday ) at 2:00 pm and the doughnuts are stale - they are at least a day old . why not let the customers know that the doughnuts are not fresh in the afternoon so we know not to buy them ? why sell stale doughnuts ? if you open at 6:00 am , why are the doughnuts stale at 2:00 pm ? it was n't until i got home and ate a doughnut that i realized they were stale . so , go at night .
1	3rd visit was just as good !
0	it 's good for fast and cheap food , but it 's a put off eating at the restaurant sometimes . every time i come here , there 's always a big group of flies flying around . it 's super annoying . also , since the workers most likely do n't want to work there , they 're a bit rude . i guess ordering in english instead of tagalog was a big sign of make fun of me was put on my forehead , since they kept laughing at the fact that i was probably `` white washed '' in retaliation , i thanked them in tagalog and sat nearby talking in tagalog to my best friend .
1	got the `` chikn/ avo/ chipotle '' delicious . my husband got 2 because he could n't choose : the montagu & the original ... both were good . i really enjoyed a bite of his `` original ''
0	horrible , horrible service is what is was all about my last time there . i went there last week during my lunch break with a couple of people from my work . when we arrived we were promptly seated and the waitress came by at took our drink order . we all ordered water and then ordered our meals . we were then ignored for 45+ minutes while we waited for our food . no check ups by the waitress , no i am sorry your food is taking so long . hey do you need a refill , no nothing . at that point since we were out of time and had to get back to the office so we got up to leave . that is when we were finally noticed . the waitress came running over almost freaking out saying our food is just about ready . where were you 20 minutes ago ? anyway one guy in my party had guilt over leaving and paid for the whole order to go . i disagree that he should of done that since we were not into them for anything because we were all drinking water but that was his choice . i understand that sometimes freshly made food takes a bit longer when its prepared fresh , but not 40 minutes . but there is no excuse to ignore someone for that amount of time . p.s . in response to the owner 's comments , i stand by what i said in my review as accurate . so based on what the owner says , good customer service is to call me a liar , write a snarky insincere response , and rally against yelp and other review sites complaining about how unfair they are ? i have read all the owner 's comments left towards other yelpers and there is a consistent theme throughout them . if something goes wrong during your visit , do n't blame the restaurant . not a very productive response in my opinion . i think highly of yelp as yet another tool for consumers to made educated decisions about where to spend their hard earned money . it is also good for businesses that go above and beyond because they will always be rewarded with my repeat business .
1	this was the best veterinarian visit my dog , obadiah and i have ever had . first , the clinic itself is clean and welcoming . second , the staff are friendly and professional . they even have their own pets behind the desk , indicating their true love of animals . third , they are very reasonably priced . i was first referred here through my pet insurance through my place of work . best of all is the vet himself , dr. k. obadiah , my airedale terrier , loved him and could not stop kissing him ha ! needless to say , he is very good with animals , but also stayed to answer all my questions and presented me with options and choices . i drove out of my way to go to this vet , and now i am glad i did . such a great experience . i have such a peace of mind knowing my dog is in good hands if something comes up . they were extremely timely , and we did n't hardly even wait for the visit , which was a completely new concept compared to our past experiences with vets . they really should be commended on the service they offer !
1	wow , this was n't just a really exquisite meal , it was a dining experience . we got the pris fix , and loved every portion of it . great presentation , perfectly cooked , and perfectly paired together . plus we got to see the bellagio fountains go off many times during the meal , it was very neat ! we had a great time
0	based on all the reviews here we gave this a try . i do n't think we have ever been so dissatisfied at any other restaurant , that we have been to . my wife ordered fettuccine , with alfredo sauce . it was like water , without taste . and mine was angel hair pasta with tomato sauce , and it was n't any more flavorful , than hers was . i did like the warm bread , but the olive oil and vinegar to dip the bread in , had far too much vinegar . and we had to wait for quite a while , for the food to arrive . we were expecting a very good meal , and were very disappointed .
0	not a bad vape store but definitely not the best ( it use to be ) i 've bought a ton of mod 's , rda 's and a countless number of juice from vape street . this use to be my go to place even though i find them a bit overpriced on a lot of hardware , i 've always had great customer service here but after finding break time this place has become a thing of my past . if you do happen to go make sure you try kings cup e jucie . * edit * they are over pricing now , cereal killa is $ 16.99 everywhere but vape street sells it for $ 22 ... come on now if other places can sell it for $ 16.99 the same price as the company who make 's it sells it for then why cant you ? over priced ! !
1	now this is what im talking about ! i didnt think a place like this existed in phoenix . i wouldnt be surprised to see this type of record store tucked into the heart of the village in nyc . it is small and has an organized chaos that is essential for any good record store . as you approach the entrance you can catch the faint smell of nag champa , again , a necessity for a great music shop . the selection is fantastic . i was able to find some old grateful dead records that i didnt even know existed .
1	this place was really cute . the food was really good . went with a group of 8 on a saturday morning . called ahead for the wait time and was seated right around the time they said the wait would be . definitely recommend this place .
0	i do n't usually like going out for korean bbq , because i can just eat it at home with my family . on this night , i decided to go with some friends , because we had just finished date night at some paint and wine thing . after three hours of drinking wine and painting , we were hungry . we had decided on tofu hut , because of their ayce option . also , starting at 10pm , the ayce is cheaper than normal during the day . it was kind of busy , and we ended up waiting around 20-30 minutes . the old korean ladies are never very pleasant or nice , they never smile . whenever we ordered meat or food , they would give us a blank stare and walk off . also , the salad was so bland and tasteless . part of the korean bbq experience is eating the yummy salad that comes with it ! the salad had no flavor and it was really dry . it felt as if we were eating bunny food - ugh . next , our grill was burning so much that the bottom started to burn . we thought that my boyfriend 's pants were on fire at first and started to freak out . the bottom part of the grill had overheated or something , and there was so much smoke and it smelled of gas . we thought that it was going to blow up - might think im overexaggerating , but for ten seconds or so , we did . the old korean lady rushed over , took off our grill , then dumped ice on everything . after this , we all lost our appetite and did not want to eat anymore . we had asked for our check , and not once , did they apologize for what happened or even give us some type of discount for us not even finishing our food . never coming here again
1	although i proclaim vietnamese food is one of my all time favorites , if not the favorite , i can never get myself to go to a vietnamese restaurant . growing up with a chef for a dad , and a mom that can rival him in this cuisine , makes me never want to pay for something that they can cook better . anytime pho is mentioned , i find eight friends lining up at the front door . finally giving in and taking the advice of various friends , i came to this converted 50 's diner . when you walk in , you are greeted by the conflicting smell of vietnamese food and the shell of the western world . not much has changed in aesthetics besides the few scattered asian trinkets and framed artwork . the food is a little pricier than you will find in chinatown , but i do not have to drink a gallon of water to subdue the side effects of msg overload . i am not saying that they do n't use any , it just is n't as noticeable . my group had ordered spring rolls . they were on the small side , but the flavors were all there . i swear i tasted mint in there and that is an ingredient that some places neglect to include and it is a shame . i had ordered the lotus salad . this was exactly what i was craving . light , flavorful , cool and not greasy . the perfect meal for the summer months . the salad consists of lotus stems , jicama , mint , onions , shrimp , and pork served with a tamarind sauce and shrimp crackers . if you like the vietnamese version of papaya salad , you would probably like this as well . when it is the middle of july , you will not be in the mood for a big bowl of pho , but know there are still options .
0	their pizza is ok. tried it several time but have nothing good or bad to say ... just ok. i am a fan of their balsamic grilled chicken salad . chicken is marinated and it tastes great , love the cheese and the walnuts as well . i can taste the basil in the salad and i like the flavor it brings . i would strongly suggest asking for dressing on the side . couple of times i forgot to ask for dressing on the side and my salad was drenched in dressing ... i will be back but just for the salad ( with dressing on the side ... lol ) not the pizza .
1	i 've been going here for years it 's always been excellent ! i 'm surprised that this place has n't been featured on food network yet . i do wish they sold breadbowls . nevertheless , i imagine that all of their breads will pair with your soup of the day .
0	arrogant and condescending . they will not make any substitutions because ( direct quote ) `` this is an award winning menu . the kitchen will not allow substitutions because it would change the flavor profile . '' they serve chicken and waffles . and pancakes . and hamburgers . seriously . `` change the flavor profile '' with _this_ menu . what colossal ego got put in charge of this place ... they have plain plastic bottles of ketchup on the table , but only have cucumber ranch dressing . drinks are good , and come in cool leaning glasses . but do n't ask for blended ice ; they only use the blender the kitchen . decor is stainless steel , bolts and suspension cables , but every dish has a sprig of rosemary . music is a strange blend of 80s pop , jazz and reggae . often distracting . very confused identity . the food tastes good , and might be worth the price if you like eating leftovers . ( the portions _are_ huge . ) it is definitely not worth being insulted and told what you can and can not order . five stars for good flavor and big portions . negative three ( and i 'm being kind ) for the attitude .
1	amazing ! ! ! this was my first time at the venetian and i totally enjoyed this hotel ! the room was spacious and very appealing to the eye . only thing i did n't like -- front desk said the bar in the room is very sensitive ... so if you moved anything , you will be charged for it ... hmmmm the bed was very comfy -- soft sheets etc ! my fave place was the bathroom tho -- -huge w/ mirrors/glass everywhere ! love dat ! i enjoyed watching tv while getting myself together . the location of the venetian is one of the best -- right in the middle . walking distance to restaurants , macys , bloomys ' , walgreens ( u always need that ) , and other other hotels near by . i went to tao sat nite which was cool ... we were hotel guests and did n't see the guest line until we were already standing on line for 15min or so -- -smh ! tao is huge -- -- music was pretty good as well . oh , let me not forget abt the restaurant -- food was grrrrrrrrreat ! hmmmm mmmmm mmmm good . for app -- we had thai crab cakes w/ mango chili sauce -- one of the best crab cakes if i may say so . main course -- i had kun pao chicken .... delicious ! just the right amt spice and overal just really tasty ! my boo had the red snapper -- was ok ... he enjoyed . i made it to the gym abt 3x out of the 5days i spent -- : - ) got ta keep it tight peeps . took a spin class which was really good ( apparently we snuck in ) . i found out later when i try to take another class that it 's $ 20 a day to register , which always gives you access to aquanova etc .... i think the classes should be complimentary ! i also went to the canyon ranch spa for a few hrs -- -recvd ' a full body massage -- womp womp ! : - ( .... i felt ok after but i 've had better . my masseuse ( sp ) needed to soak his hands in vit e oil for at least 2 days -- -can we say rough ? ! and his heavy breathing was a major distraction . all the other amenities in the spa was nice and very relaxing . overall -- i really enjoyed myself ... did just the right amt and got more than enough sleep ! i will def be back and this hotel is highly recommended . oh -- i went to the zumanity show at the ny ny hotel -- interesante ... hahaha .
0	this place is really showing it 's age . the carpet has stains in it , the ac works 24/7 to keep the living room area at 72 , the bedroom never cooled below 82. breakfast is good , and who could complain about free booze . two times i had to wait over 30 mins for the van to pick me up at the metro . one of the times , they went right past me at the meeting point . after speaking with the manager , he refuned me 1 night out of 5 for my troubles of having to sleep on the couch 2 nights . but i wish i stayed at the double tree .
1	the oyster po ' boy was amazing ! - loved it ! the seafood gumbo was terrific- very flavorful , but not thick and gloopy . we also really enjoyed the cajun chips . the only thing i wish we could have had with our meal was a nice cold beer ! the atmosphere is nothing to write home about , small and 'diner-like ' , but when my brother and i went there a few fridays ago , the line backed up to the door to place an order . it was a drive to get out there , but definitely worth it .
1	this is one of my favorite used bookstores in las vegas ! they have an amazing selection on self help , religious , and spiritual books . the people who work there are always kind . when they are 20 minutes from closing , they do n't kick you out like a lot of the other ones do . they will politely say they are closing , five minutes from closing . you can sell or trade your books there as well . i love this place ! i go here at least once a month .
0	i was not impressed at all ! first of all my father asked to have a tanqueray and tonic to drink and the waitress had to ask multiple times what that was then she responded by saying `` i 'm not 21 . `` normally the waiter will bring out some bread to the table while you wait , nope not at this place .... how thoughtful ( do you sense my sarcasm ? ) we were a party of four and everyone in my party had their food brought to the table except me , and i ordered a salad . after waiting for about 10 minutes my salad was finally brought to our table . do n't you think salad would be the first thing that would have been made ? after we received our food we had to wait for silverware to be brought to the table because at this restaurant they do n't put the silverware on the table .... some young boy bring you the silverware from the back with his bare hands . yuck ! i had ordered the greek country salad , well little did i know that meant it had no lettuce/spinach at all .... it was just cucumbers , tomatoes , and onions . in the description on the menu it says `` hand picked vine ripe tomato . '' i did n't know that it would be multiple tomatoes , it only said one ! the whole salad was nothing but tomatoes ! i must say for a place that has a somewhat nice atmosphere this place had nothing but teenagers as servers .... this is not a local pizza parlor , they need to employ more experienced servers because these kids were walking around as if they were confused about everything . sad to say i wo n't be returning here .
0	i was talking with rand about having eaten at souper salad the previous week and he suggested we meet up here , right across the highway , to compare the two . yesterday we did so . the foods were all fresh . we agreed most of the hot items lacked much in the way of flavor . i do n't think i cared much for having the salad bar between the front door and the cash register . another thing i thought odd was a section of the salad bar that had extra cost items to add to your salad . one question i have is why they are very busy when souper salad across the way with a very similar menu and execution for less money has hardly anybody in it .
0	i 've had multiple things repaired here when desperate . once was a dress that just needed the unfinished hem cut , which she took on in a hurry and did a decent job with . she did fine with having jeans hemmed shorter too . another time i gave her an expensive winter coat to have the sleeves shortened , and i got the coat back with the sleeves so short it 's laughable . i do n't blame her for the shoddy job as clearly i should have complained when it happened , but i definitely wo n't take anything back here that is expensive .
1	my recent meal at blue hound kitchen & cocktails is one that i wished could have lasted forever -- and with the abundance of dishes my companion and i were lucky enough to try ( thanks , j. lauren pr ) , it was a delightful time that still has my mouth watering . and the food is n't the only draw here , though chef stephen jones ' ever-changing seasonal menu is worth the trip . my companion noted the spot seemed like one movie character ron burgundy would love , with a `` stay classy '' feel crafted with lots of wooden accents , sports on at the cozy bar , dim lighting , and comfy leather booths that make diners feel like they 're in their own private little worlds . the bar and restaurant , nestled into the hotel palomar at cityscape in downtown phoenix , has big city views of the adjoining bustling cityscape atmosphere . the atmosphere is about new york city as you can find downtown , and on a monday night , there were lots of suits , way more men than women , filing up the bar area . if you 're on the prowl for a new guy , head for a cocktail here -- the selection is vast , with stand-out 's including the oh-so-refreshing floradora ( $ 10 ) , with gin , lime , raspberry syrup , soda and ginger ; and the french riviera ( $ 10 ) , with dolin blanc , velvet falernum , strawberries and club soda . the cocktail menu has a ton of diversity , so there 's bound to be something you like . as for the menu , chef stephen jones recently revamped more than half of it , with locally sourced menu items that give all the dishes a refreshing taste . the latest menu is seafood-focused , and my pal tried the jerk cured scottish salmon with shaved celery , apple and fennel salad and a potato puree ( $ 9 for a small portion ) . he said the fish was perfectly cooked , and the sweet elements balanced out the dish . i had to try some of my favorite soup , gazpacho , a cup of which came with the perfect fresh veggies garnish to stir into the cold blended soup ( $ 5 ) . i 've had my fair share of gazpacho soups in spain , and this was hands-down one of my favorites . it was thick and rich , which i loved , and perfectly flavored . we also started with the crows dairy goats milk yellow corn cake ( $ 5- $ 10 , based on portion ) , which was topped with a red onion jam and marinated spring squash . everything about this was delightful , from the consistency and buttery flavor of the corn cake , to the perfect jam topping that was a pleasant surprise that worked . the marinated veggies added some savoriness , and i wanted more . i loved that all the dishes are designed for trying , since there are sampler portions of just about everything on the menu . my companion got a small portion of the lamb meatballs , with dandelion greens , potatoes , chickpeas , and red onion yogurt ( $ 9 ) . it 's got to be one of the most innovative , fanciest dishes you could try at that price . chef stephen also sent out an appetizer of shisito peppers ( $ 5- $ 8 ) , which is something i 've actually never had before . the peppers were fun to nosh on and were tame enough for anyone 's palate . i ordered a plum tomato flatbread , made with house-pulled mozzarella ( $ 12 ) . all the ingredients were stand-out and high-quality , but i 've had a flatbread like this at st. francis . opt for the more outside-the-box offerings if you go to blue hound . chef stephen was also kind enough to send out a lemon and fennel sorbet , which was light and refreshing and a perfect meal-ender -- even though i had insisted i was too full for dessert , i could n't help eating every bit of my portion . the fennel offering was unlike anything i 'd ever tasted before -- it was a really interesting flavor that definitely gave the dessert a farm-to-table taste . i 'd give the dessert points on uniqueness alone . not only was it a pleasure to meet chef stephen and gobble up his amazing food in a relaxed but classy atmosphere , the service was also impeccable . like the hotel it 's housed in , blue hound kitchen & cocktails strives to make its customers feel at home , too .
0	as far as the staff goes it is 5 star , but , since when does it take a c note for 2 people to go to the movies and get something to eat . i did n't even spend as much at smg and that was a full dinner with dessert . h theaters @ 101 is a notable step up and at a more affordable price .
0	i was really expecting more from this place . i mean , the entrance was nice and the service was n't bad either ! it 's just that .... the food was , gross . i mean , i 've had waaaaaaay better . even ihop makes the cut of being better . the spice market is kind of messy and well , i do n't know . i really do n't like it . i hate the concept of toasting your own piece of bread at a buffet .
1	outstanding happy hour and fantastic food . this is a regular place for me and my husband , visiting 1-2 times a week . the `` local '' margarita is by far my favorite , not too sweet ! the grilled ono taco is also my favorite thing on the menu ! : )
0	my husband and i had really high hopes for this place . i tried to call a number of times and emailed the restaurant as well for a reservation . no reply either way . however , given the reviews we really wanted to give it a shot . so arrived around 845 to take a chance a a table . the hostess noted a 15 minute wait and we immediately jumped at the chance thinking we had lucked out for my birthday . ordered a bottle of prosecco and veal tartare to start , both were good . nothing to write home about though ... the waitress was attentive when we arrived then gradually less so ..... they had a special that evening of clam , king crab , shrimp and french sausage ; pan fried then placed in a saffron lobster sauce . sounded delicious while quite expensive at $ 49 . but then again it was my birthday dinner so we went for it . my husband ordered the short rib . the bread that kept arriving at other tables never made it to ours , which was disappointing but i did want to save my appetite for the actual goodness to come . so no harm no foul there really ... after our veal tartare , we basically sat and waited . our glasses were empty but no one came to refill us . no one even glanced our way for a entire period between our courses ... i kept my optimism as i waited for the ever so rich and scrumptious sounding dinner . when it did come , it was borderline lukewarm . the broth too salty and nothing tasting as it should . i like my meals hot , and for the price you pay you would expect it as such . the short rib was not as tender as we had hoped either . we actually did need a knife . all in all , poor service , disorganized and mediocre food . i 'm sure it would have been much better had it been hot . sadly they did not allow me to have that experience and provide what may have been a better review
0	adecuate if you are drunk and need a bomb to sober up
0	blue martini has a pretty good live band . food is so so . we got the spinach artichoke dip and that tomato with bread dish that i ca n't think of the name right now . main thing i did n't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd , around mid 30s and up . thus , even if they have live band , the music genre is pretty old school and yea ... not my cup of tea . i felt like everyone was really old and creepy . it is a nice bar for older crowd who wants to go hook up with other locals though .
0	maybe i am just sick of buffets , but this one just does not have any appealing attributes . the large room is understaffed . i was watching our server running between 15 different tables . there was no time for guest service other than get them their drinks and clear tables . it took 10 minutes before we saw our server because he was swamped . the food quality is substandard fare . the salad bar was one of my favorite stations because it had roasted beets . there was n't anything special , but it was consistent and well kept . the shrimp cocktail were not bad either . other than that , i would skip everything else . food stations ran short on a few occasions . finding a plate , or some ramekins were near impossible .
0	i used to like this place but after today i will never return . i ordered the teriyaki chicken burger and it was straight up nasty . i know i 'm a picky eater so i try to get things that are hard to mess up . this thing was an epic fail . the entire bottom of the plate was wet making the fries and the bottom of the bun ruined . it did n't matter the fries tasted strange and the bun although burnt from the grill on one side looked like it had n't been baked long enough . the chicken itself was dry as a bone and burnt as well . when i think chicken burger i think a piece of breast meat , but i do n't know what this was . it was more like a clump of chicken sawed in half with a huge chunk of gristle down the middle of it . just yuck . i think the worst part though was the cashier , when she asked how it was i told her , `` well the service was good . '' she kind of just shrugged and said nothing like she knows the food sucks . so i ended up paying almost twenty bucks for this plate of shit and i had to stop and grab something quick to eat because this meal ended up in the garbage were it belonged .
0	ahhh sambalatte where do i begin ... this place is great if you enjoy a cliche vegas place trying too hard to be something it is not , trendy/local/hip ... its completely kitsch their subpar coffee is prepared by uneducated ( coffee-wise ) and rude employees their latte art is cool but it adds to the already long wait to get some coffee . # gag
0	headed over for lunch this week . the place looked awesome - that 's where the awesomeness ended though . it was like a bunch of kids got together in a really cool clubhouse and decided to play restaurant . it boggles my mind to think that investors spend millions to renovate a place and then allow incompetent or incapable management ( that was not seen once during the visit ) to kill that vibe and their profit potential . staff was completely disorganized and nobody seemed to know what their job was . service suffered miserably . waitress kept disappearing , acted annoyed when we asked for some chips and salsa after being seated and then abandoned for 10 minutes . then we got our drinks from the `` too cool for school in my killer shades i 'm wearing inside '' bartender who had no idea what she was doing . the cup was completely filled with ice ( think overflowing over the rim type full ) so i emptied it in like 3 sips . i also saw her make a cocktail by pouring directly from an open bottle ( no pourer , no jigger , no measure really at all , just winging it like a hobo from big bottle and when i watched the patron drink it , he squinted his eyes out of reflex and made a sour face . oh and he had to send his wife to the bar to retrieve the drink in the first place ... ) my drink sat on the table empty with no less than 3 trips past our table by each of the following : our waitress , the bartender , the hostess and the barback walking by but instead of checking our table looked everywhere else . everybody seemed to be doing everybody else 's job . the hostess would seat people and then the waitress would ask her to bring tables chips and salsa . the bartender would disappear to retrieve cases of beer . the barback was delivering orders to tables . they all seemed to want to re-clean an empty table no less than 4 times ... our waitress disappeared several times for at least 10 minutes . funny thing is that they were n't very busy . ok , it is n't very funny but is pretty piss poor service . we drank a couple drinks and finally got the chips and salsa which were not even offered to be refilled . things got worse after the nearly hour went by and we finally got our food . the waitress explained there was some `` mishap '' in the kitchen and that my order had been forgotten in the oven by the chef . i can only imagine that it caught fire in the oven and started smoking before someone pulled their head out of their ass and realized it . at any rate , she already had another one ready that she brought out with her explaination and the pork was decent , the only problem was i ordered chicken and really do n't care for pork . muthaf # @ # $ % ! at this point we were a good hour plus into lunch and i dared not ask them to correct it . waiting for our check was just as painfully slow but we were not alone there as i noted the other table ( that had to get their drink earlier ) had their check with bank card sticking out for visibility . the glances we made to each other said it all - wonder if anyone would notice if we just up and left ... finally got our check and had to wait another 10 minutes to pay , even though there was only a few tables seated at this point .
1	great little hotel . stayed here for business because it looked nice in the pics and the price was right . it 's in a great location near old town scottsdale . plenty to do and great places eat within walking distance . my room was clean and quiet and looked like the one in the pictures . having the jacuzzi tub in the room was a little 80 's movie for me , but i 'm sure it works for some : ) i thought the bed was very comfortable and i slept like a baby ! breakfast was basic continental breakfast , great muffins though . about and hour after i left i got a phone call telling me i left my charger for my iphone and ipad . i was very greatful they called me about it !
0	like many of the vegas buffets , there is a huge selection , but bellagio 's food quality is average/borderline bad . pros : -their weekday dinner buffet ends at 10 ( instead of 9pm like wicked spoon ) -good , diverse dessert selection -they have snow and king crabs ( delicious ) -their sashimi mix was scrumptious ( had both salmon and tuna ) cons : -their service can be a little slow . we had to look for a waiter to get us our water/drinks -came at 8:40pm and there was still at 20min wait for the dinner buffet ( left us with 1 hr ) -i was so excited to see that they had macarons , but it was just ... bad . the middle part was just jam ... what . -they had a lot of food , but there was only one or two dishes that i really enjoyed . there 's something off about the food quality here . -dinner on weekdays was $ 34 , but i still do n't think it was worth the price pass . there are better buffets/restaurants in vegas ( eg : burgr by gordon ramsey )
0	i would give negative star i could . the menu pricing is not in line with what they charging . this is illegal and unethical . i will report this to bbb and state commerce .
0	do not do business at this jewelry store ! they damaged my engagement ring ! i was looking at wedding bands and asked for my engagement ring to be cleaned while i looked . it was a customer comfort fit , and instead of just cleaning it as i had ask , the lady put it on a shaper to `` reshape '' it and completely bent it ! the jeweler was not in , and i was told the owner would call me first thing in the morning . the owner did not call me as the manager had indicated , so i contacted him in the morning and told him i expected the store to pay for my ring to be fixed . he was very rude & told me that he has been in the jewelry business for a long time and has never had any problems . i responded that there was a problem now and asked how he was going to handle it . he again insisted that he had not had any problems in the past but told me to call him once i got the ring repaired and he would `` see what he could do '' . i had the ring repaired for a cost of less than $ 75 , but he will not call me or my husband back so we can work out the details for him to pay . i have experienced how poorly and rudely he treats potential customers , and would highly recommend not purchasing anything from this store . i did file a report with the mall security so that i would have a documented record of what happened , and will try to pursue other options - perhaps small claims .
1	cronuts & yelpers are what drew me to this place . saturday morning and all a buzz with the breakfast crowd . just walking by , you want to come in and be a part of this hip looking establishment . my inner sweet tooth wanted to climb over the dessert window upon entering . this is no average bakery . the desserts are plump and inviting and not the standard grocery store baked goods that are a dime a dozen . today we came for the much anticipated cronut that i could n't wait to try and even called to make sure they had them . dominic was nice enough to set aside some for me . well my proverbial eyes were much , much too big to handle what we would encounter . in doing a little research on the cronut , i thought they would be manageable sized `` croissant donuts '' . so i told them to hold 6. lo and behold , we get to the counter and see that each cronut is sliced and layered in between is a rich vanilla custard . 6 was an overkill . the girl at the counter was nice enough to take back a few when our eyes bugged out at the $ 30 tab . the cronuts were much heavier and more dense than i would have liked . they tasted good , but i did n't want to waste my whole weekend 's caloric limit on 1 cronut . i would have preferred them much lighter and similar to a croissant texture . but i 'm glad we tried bread & butter as this may become our weekend breakfast spot .
0	great happy hour , never got to try their drinks , but the food items on the happy hour menu was great , and on the lower side for vegas . the hostess was cold and not very friendly but our waitress was a sweetheart , and the food was yummy . we will return for drinks next time we 're in town .
0	this company has taken us for $ 4300 . they are scam artists and jonas bowen and larry smith need to go to prison for fraud . we have been trying to get them to record the title of our timeshares into the name of world travel access for eight months to no avail . we are filing suit against them in small claims court in california and intend to fly to las vegas to do the same . we will also contact the attorney general in clark county as well as bbb . i suspect these guys take in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year defrauding people . it 's pathetic . we did due diligence on this company back in october and there were no negative reports on the internet . obviously , that has changed drastically . clo h and alan j
0	this was our first visit and it is about time as my curiosity for the last few years has been going wild every time we pass by and see a packed lot . i used to live just a block from here approximately four years ago when they were building krazy buffet . i had moved just prior to their opening and wondered what affect it would have on one of my favorite chinese restaurants just down the street ( bobo china ) . i was in the mood for chinese and we were very hungry , wanting to resolve our lunch and dinner all in one shot . the place is clean , has comfy cushy booths , lots of variety of food to select from and great staff clearing tables and bringing drink refills . the food was good , not bad and not great . the sushi was better than usual buffet sushi which is usually horrid . i enjoyed the stuffed mussels , orange chicken , fried rice , fried shrimp , coconut shrimp , sushi , meatball skewers , pot stickers , cherry bananas and coconut macaroons for dessert . mmmmm those pork meatball skewers were packed full of flavor with a drizzle of bbq sauce on them . yummy . i could sit and just eat a plate of those balls and be satisfied . they have a great salad bar as well which was super fresh and had all of the toppings and dressing you could want . my hubby really enjoyed the super big juicy chicken wings fried to perfection in a delicious light batter . this visit did the trick , we came we ate and we conquered . their building was built new and looks nice on the outside however the inside of the restaurant was dumpy looking with old booths .
1	best nail spa ! i used to go to mark and amy when they were at creative nails . i was so happy that i was able to find them again ! i 'm incredibly picky on how i like my nails done and i can honestly say i 'm satisfied every single time i leave the salon . i ca n't imagine going anywhere else .
1	this is definitely my go-to sushi place ! great for dates , celebrations and taking out-of-towners . walking in , the decor and ambiance is trendy , clean and impressive , yet casual enough where you do n't ' feel out of place if you 're not dressed up . the pretty hostesses are friendly and accommodating- i 've yet to experience bad service in all the times i 've been there . depending on the time of day , there could be a long wait , but hey ! you 're in tempe marketplace ! if you have to wait , take the vibrating coaster and head outside ! enjoy the fireplace right in front or go shopping right next door ! the area is gorgeous ! i suggest snatching the patio tables if it becomes available or squeeze in at the bar if you do n't have the patience to wait . the patio seating by the bar is definitely my favorite spot . it 's great for people watching and enjoying the arizona air . for a bonus ! if you go on weekends , there 's usually a live performer right outside barns & noble so you get a show with your meal ! so let 's talk food ! ! yaaay ! they change up their menu now and then to keep things interesting . if you have n't tried the garlic edamame , it 's a tasty twist to the regular edamame . my favorite appetizer is the bbq beef ribs . order a side of rice and you 're set ! careful unless you want to fill up . i recommend going there for happy hour and/or reverse happy hour ( awesome prices ! ) where my usual broiled mussel on a half shell is only $ 5.95 ! yumm ! the poke tuna is great but i do n't remember if we were too impressed by the steamed clams . they have a huge selection of sushi rolls . these are my favs : paradise , eel & avocado , rainbow , & sunkissed roll . if you 're there with a huge party and super hungry , i suggest ordering their boat option . very fun . the only time i remember being disappointed was when i ordered their ramen dish and some of the food we tried came out a bit more salty than we like , but overall , this is really a great place to dine . to end this review- you have to check out their drink selections ! ! cocktails , spirits , sake , wine , beer .. anything you like ! enjoy !
0	i would have to describe the vine as being , first and foremost , a filthy place . dirty tables ... some of them are broken and will fall over if you rest a pitcher on it . some of the cushy seats inside have large gashes in them and their inside stuffing is bleeding out like entrails . the crowd is such an odd mixture of lowlives , well-dressed college kids , complete douche bags , metal kids , crusty kids , bros , middle aged boozers , hipsters and that one lady sitting at the end of the bar wearing a cocktail dress with a martini in her hand , a gun in her purse and a dark secret . that 's what i really like about the vine . it 's a strange place , for sure . the bathroom has graffiti in such high-up places , someone either brought in a chair , stood on somebody 's shoulders or had to balance one foot on the urinal and one on the sink in order to get into those awkward corners . on a few days out of the week , they have $ 1 you call its . the cover is $ 5 and you can go to town on cheap drinks . granted , you do n't get a full-ass glass of beer , you get a little plastic cup , but still it 's still only a dollar . for dirt cheap , you can get wasted . it 's a cool place to come in and wet your whistle , but i could never see being a regular . i like my dives dirty and i like my crowds strange , but the vine just has something about it that strikes me as creepy . it really would n't surprise me if i found out that the vine had been build on a piece of land where a family had been slaughtered over a hundred years ago . i do n't think the place is haunted by ghosts , but it 's definitely haunted by awkwardness . whereas most dive bars sort of revel in their own filth , this place is sort of like you went over to your friend 's house and found out that they have filthy , alcoholic parents that they 're ashamed of . check this place out . friday nights can get poppin ' off and you can expect to have a hangover the next day because with $ 1 drinks ... come on .
1	my boyfriend and i stayed vdara for 5 days in our christmas . we had gorgeous room , phenomenal view from our room , clean and neat everything by 3days but last day of night , when we come back to our room was not clean well . it was too bad because almost perfect amazing night we could spent .
0	well , the last stay did not go well , it is always something everytime we go . annoying little inconveniences or a desk clerk that acts like we interrupted his well deserved time alone . people opening our rooms with suit cases in hand because the room was double booked ...... awkward ! we were those people walking in on someone 2 vacations ago at mgm . we made a reservation for a room online waaay ahead of time for a queen smoking room but they said they did n't have any until the next day so we had to live out of suitcases that night so we could move to the correct room in the morning . we have collectively decided that mgm 's is no longer our hotel . too many issues , 8 strikes ... you 're out .
1	so , we stayed at the luxor last weekend for the memorial weekend . i did lots of research on this hotel and was prepared for it to be ok , but not that nice . i was pleasantly surprised ! i had a fine time . the room was updated and clean . the hotel was nice , the spa was great and the pool was fun . i really do not know what people are complaining about . there was nothing that was really that run down or dirty . my only real complaint was the very thin walls ! our neighbor brought a young lady home ... that woke me up ! oh well , he is on vacation and deserves a little fun . but the 6 hour fight afterwards , kinda sucked . we called security twice and they came up to confront him in a timely manner . so that was good . all in all , i would come back to this place in a second . it is not the wynn , but i am also not paying $ 400 a night . the price is good and the service is fine . very happy with my experience !
0	the view of the bellagio foutains is awesome . but that 's pretty much it . our waiter told us that the dish that keep bringing people back is definitely the lamp chop . so i ordered it , along with another coworker . it was fatty , oily , and really , i 've had much better . the crust was good and the portion was large but that was n't what i expected from `` the dish that people come back for '' at a restaurant like circo . i am giving them 3 stars because my beef carpaccio app was decent and so was my sorbet dessert . but i do n't think i 'd be back again . with all those amazing vegas restaurants to choose from , it 's not going to be on my list of re-visits unless someone else is paying .
0	you can expect better quality service at mcdonalds , this place was awful . we were ignored the entire time , server was rude , manager was extremely rude & unprofessional . he rolled his eyes and laughed at me while i was talking to him about our service & food . i used to enjoy coming to this place but i will never be back & make sure to let everyone know they 're very unprofessional & treat their customers like shit .
0	do not eat here ! i wish i could give negative stars ! ! ! i have ordered to go or delivery several times and never had a problem until last night ... my green curry was obviously dyed with green dye and my husband found many chunks of chicken bone in his basil chicken and my daughters pad see ew . my husband almost broke his tooth and my daughter could have choked ! when i called to let them know and get my money back , they refused to give my $ back . one excuse after another ... no manager on site , i do n't know how , bring the food back to the restaurant so i can see the bone even though you have a baby and it 's 8 at night blah blah blah ... after 40 mins on the phone , they finally told me they 'd give me cash back the next day . i get here to pick up my refund and i was treated with attitude and them asking why i did n't bring the food back in . i said `` so you want me to drive around and work all day with thai food in my car ? ? ! '' utterly ridiculous ! then she had the audacity to say `` it was just a little bit of bone '' ! ! ! ! do not eat here . they obviously do n't care about their food or patrons . i 'm seriously disgusted .
0	it was average . drinks were interesting and food was not as much as i expected . overpriced for the tiny pink tacos . the meal has the restaurants title ... at least make that one dish plentiful . the only thing i liked were the pickled onions on the pink taco 's .
0	really cool bar club that if you get on the rooftop you can have a great view from up high . enjoy will go again
1	i signed up for the groupon that was offered this summer for a level i improv class here . i did a little research beforehand and saw that it is a start-up cooperative comprised of local improv talents , many of whom have studied at second city or with other famous workshops and improvisational groups around the country . i since learned that they are also thrilled to have their own space and have great spirit . i was n't certain what to expect from improv class- and i was pleasantly surprised ! i have been to a few improv shows , including upright citizens brigade and a couple of other shows in la and here in phoenix . improv is an acquired taste for many -- the scenes are often a bit unclear and you have to be really willing to roll with where the actors are going . since i needed to just let loose and have fun , i figured this would be a great outlet ! i worked with sam , who is an absolute joy and very professional . i worry about a lack of organization when it comes to teaching something that seems very willy nilly , but he provided in-depth step-by-step guidelines to the art of working without guidelines , and that 's pretty impressive ! each week featured a different lesson , and there was not a single class where i did not laugh a lot . along with the class , you are required to see up to 4 shows for free as a student . my favorite is the skewed news hour . members of the audience cut out news stories from provided newspapers and there are scenes put on based on those story suggestions . hilarity ensues . one show in particular stood out when warren jeffs compound was the subject ... imagine my surprise when i found a pool under my chair because i laughed so hard ( ok , not really ) . i have been impressed with this show 's consistency and i have also enjoyed a couple of the others . now it 's one of my favorite things to go to hula 's and see an inexpensive show at the torch afterward and have a complete evening ! spread the word !
1	a good place to go when indecisive on dining . they typical have 2 above average dinner specials each night that can reduce the indecision to a coin flip . the off-label king james brew mix is my personal favorite , but you ca n't go wrong with most of the selection .
0	lack of organization and thought for the customers . goldfield has plenty of parking and is free to enter , however you must pay to enter any of the attractions ( museum , mine , bordello , mystery shack , train tour , reptiles , etc ) . as well there are tip jars all over the place . we purchased their multi-pack which gave us tickets for the train ride , mystery shack and mine tour . i think it saved us $ 3-5 on an adult admission ( i seem to think it was $ 16/adult ) . we purchased our pack at the train station , where there are also public washrooms available . there are some in town but seem to be lined up all the time . we boarded the train for a tour around the city , which i highly recommend doing first . it gives you a little bit of an idea of what is all in goldfield and an entertaining ride ( if you get a good conductor ) . i believe the train ride takes 20-30 minutes in total . we then went to the mine tour , which was excellent . our guide was very , very entertaining . he did make one little girl scared of the elevator ride ( other children were fine ) , however as someone with no children present i found him very entertaining . the mine tour itself is excellent , it gives you an idea of what went on in the mines and our guide put it over the top . he was very entertaining and humourous throughout the whole tour . the only complaint i have is that they take down a large group and if you want to take pictures of something you need to be at the front of the line or else the lights might be turned off before you get a chance ( they are turned on in sections and as you are leaving the section turned off ) . we then went to the mystery shack . we soon learned the extent of how poorly things are run . you can only have 12 people in at a time ( they sometimes allow more , our guide told us whoever could stand on the concrete pad at the far left would get in ) and there is no system in place to indicate who was waiting the longest . i would highly recommend sitting close to that concrete pad . we waited , and found out in 10 minutes that there were too many people ahead of us and given the option of waiting there another 20 minutes or coming back later and our guide would `` remember us '' . well , we decided to come back later . and still could n't get on . then we tried a third time and the tour was filled with people the guide `` remembered '' so we could n't get on . overall i think this was the worst part of the day as we had paid for the mystery shack as part of our pass but could n't get on unless we waiting there at least 20 minutes longer , then hope no one who the guide `` remembered '' bumped us off . inside of the town we went to the bordello and got lucky with a small group . as we were leaving a large group was entering , and it would n't have been nearly the same . the bordello was rather small with a couple bedrooms but was entertaining . the guide was informative and answered all of our questions . it 's $ 3 a person , but adds a little bit of interest to the day . i 'm sure it could be child friendly as there is nothing inside the house itself that is n't , and anything that is n't child friendly is really what questions people may ask . the gunfight was a little cheesy with the storyline , but still entertaining . i do n't think it 's worth it to see just for that , however it 's nice to have a different type of entertainment mixed in . the bakery was delicious and the baked goods seemed reasonably priced . they also offers some sandwiches and such if you do n't want to go to the saloon . the gifts shops are just that , gift shops . nothing special or out of the ordinary . we did not see the reptiles or `` museum '' based on previous reviews . overall i thought goldfield was an interesting way to spend an afternoon . i was very disappointed in the lack of organization with the mystery shack and that 's what brings this down a little ( rating wise ) .
0	food was okay not super impressed , but service and atmosphere was great just wish it was more authentic for the prices . would not come here again .
1	i 've been meeting friends for the past two weeks at the cafe for projects . nice cafe , descent mochas .. little pricey for a medium mocha and rice krispy treat , $ 7 all together , but then again you do get free wi fi ! service is good , the girls liked to flirt with my male friends , which 'hey '' it will make the boys tip well and passing out free samples does help sell the food ! even though it seems pricey , it ' has good drinks , clean tables , friendly staff , `` free '' wi-fi .. hopefully it wo n't go out of business anytime soon !
1	good food and good service . their pasta dishes really excell . on our last visit , we so enjoyed the chicken caesar flatbread appetizer ( we polished it off in no time ! ) and the warm chocolate-caramel-banana panini was over the top ! that , you have to try ! audrey a .
0	this place was awful ! first they have someone out front spinning a sign to get u to come in who resembles large marge from pee wees big adventure . gross . once inside there was a stale smell of vomit and desperation . the waitress was dressed like a hooters girl but in white with pink shorts . i have to assume she worked a double that day due to how dirty her tank top was , like pig pen . we ordered 2 cocktails .. vodka cran , and grape vodka soda .. total was 18 bucks ... what are in vegas ? no in vegas there are distractions to keep u from knowing you are getting ass raped for an ounce and a half of well vodka .
1	i have bought new tires and was referred by discount tires to have an alignment done . the service took little over an hour on a friday afternoon . i was glad there was a dairy queen next to the shop . they have limited seats in waiting area , especially on a busy day . the time just flew by while i was enjoying my favorite treats . when i returned to pick up my car , i was ready to pay for the $ 49.99 alignment . adam explained that i did n't need the alignment , and was no charge for the service . he showed me the print out and the wheels were aligned . this is one shop that do follow their slogan `` affordable - honest - friendly '' ! they also have coupons to print on their website .
1	ky-ko not only sealed my home after two massive bee infestations where bees literally got up , inside our walls , but i now also use them for my monthly pest prevention . while sealing up my home was not an inexpensive venture , it was well worth the money we spent to keep those darned bees ( and other pests ) out . getting bees out of my walls was no small task and to have to do it twice , was really annoying . bees leave a pheromone so that they know where to return to and once the pheromone is there , they will come back over and over . and since about 90 % of the bees in az are now africanized , it is not fun to know they are trying to co-habitate with you . ky-ko sealed my home and they have never returned . at the time , i was using another exterminating company , had been for years ) but always still had many 4 legged friends in my home and outside . while the sealing did keep the majority out , i still needed to exterminate as there are always doors , windows and ways flying things can get in . once i made the switch to ky-ko for my monthly prevention , the bugs virtually stopped . it is a rare occasion i have a bug in my home other than the occasional flies . the nice thing about it too , is they check my seal and make repairs to it as necessary for free and they also remove cobwebs and bug debris around my home . i am completely happy with ky-ko 's service !
0	i jst went there today with my friend for dinner . the salsa for the chips and the coke was good . the service was the absolute worse . someone other than the server delivered our food and when my friend wanted salsa for his tacos because they were dry , she never came by at all . he had to eat them dry because they were gettin cold . i had the burrito and it was jst average . i started out with the tortilla soup which was disgusting . it tasted like red pepper which it did have inside but ewww i ordered tortilla soup not red pepper soup . i sent that back . my friend and i were jst very mad because our server ruined his meal by never ever coming to check on us so we could ask for salsa . we were especially mad when we realized she was busy texting by the hostess stand the whole time . obviously this place does not have a supervisor around . oh and the music was horrible . so bad . it was demonic or sumtin . needless to say me and friend decided we were never ever coming back again . like ever .
1	i like what they did with the place . i think the moonshine cocktails are pretty silly since if you buy it in a store , it 's not really moonshine ... but the bowling it good !
1	my first original pancake house experience was actually not at the original location . we would occasionally go the the one in north phoenix . in that one , all done with bright colors and modern touches - we liked the food , but we were n't too hip for some of their policies . so we stopped going - and it appears that was the case with everyone else in north phoenix too as that funky and cool looking location closed down about 3 years ago or so . i 've only been to this original location once , but found that they seemed a bit less tense on some issues they were more intense on others . i went during a strong no-cell phone period apparently . and when work called , which means i had to answer , several folks gave dirty looks . while i totally get that folks should n't have obnoxious rings and talk loud into their ear pieces while walking through the restaurant , that policy seemed to encourage the dirty looks for answering a vibrating phone . so ... i have n't been back . based on selby 's review , i may have to go back one of these days because their food really was great - thus the 4 stars . but i 'll try to make sure it 's a day when i do n't expect to get any calls .
0	this place over charges and the food was not that great . it was not authentic and very americanized chinese .
1	went to see absinthe on a whim , but i got ta tell you - i have n't laughed that hard in a long time ! the acts are like `` cirque '' , but without the sometimes-nebulous `` themes '' of cirque shows . the theater and stage are so small that the audience is right on top of the action , which makes it all the better . the `` gazillionaire '' mc is hilarious - raunchy and politically incorrect in the extreme - but hilarious ! three -word summary : go see absinthe !
1	good place to go for nice mature fun . good music and good people .
0	wow never thought i 'd be so disappointed with a big name like fleming 's . i dined here with my wife for a late valentines day since we where both working on the 14th . i 'll start off with the good : the service was friendly , on point , and knowledgable about the menu . the appetizers were good mushroom ravioli and french onion soup as well as the steaks cooked just as ordered and very tasty . the bad : a la carte menus mucho dinero for a little steak and nothing else . the side i ordered , asparagus , was pretty scorched on the bottom for the price they should be cooked perfectly . my wife ordered a special lobster tail , small filet , and flemings potatoes . lobster tail was way overcooked to the point were the waiter could barely get it out of the shell and it tasted like rubber , the potatoes were bland and could have used more seasoning and to top it off the plates were hotter than hell like they had been left up in the salamander for to long . lastly the restaurant was just a little to warm and caused us to sweat through our meal . overall i will certainly not be returning and would not recommend to a friend . 2/20/2014 update- the restaurant manager contacted the the next day after reading my review and sent a gift card to give flemings another shot , i will update my review when we revisit this location .
0	i am not going to lie , the food is fresh . i ordered a build your own sandwich . i did not get what i wanted . i order meat and cheese with pickles , mayo , salt n pepper . i got meat and check with pickles , tomatoes , onions , salt and pepper . i hate tomatoes and onions which is why i did not ask for them on there . i am not sure what they were reading cause i did not ask for those . my friend ordered one of their specialty sandwiches , hoping that she would get what was listed on there ... nope , she definitely did not . we ordered together to get the free delivery . i would have rather paid for delivery then deal with what we dealt with . we ordered to our work , they said between 1255-105 , they showed up early , which normally would be fine if we were n't working . the delivery woman was sooooooo rude , huffing and puffing for having to wait , left and when i called back she was all `` i called 6 times . '' um no you did n't . i tipped her too and she was still so rude . told everyone and their moms how much she hates delivering to where we work . i just was so flabbergasted by their customer service . not only was our food wrong , but rude people too . no thanks .
0	the grandest of all ghetto mcdonald 's .
0	service : poor . we were getting a pizza to go , so we went to the bar . the bartender did n't seem to be interested in serving us at all . my friend was trying to order a specific pizza without some of the topping and he was just not helpful or receptive . surprise , surprise , it came back wrong . by the time we got the pizza , it was 10 pm and we were just ready to go . someone came out and offered to redo the pizza and promised to have it out in 8 minutes , which made us wonder- why could n't the first one be out in 8 minutes ? whatever . they made it correctly , and in good time . also , my friend and i went back out while the first pizza was being made so i could go elsewhere , and she got a drink . when we got back to mm , she asked if the drink she ordered could be canceled , and the bartender says `` why , what happened ? '' do n't worry about why , just cancel it ! food : it looked great , like amazing ! she liked it .
0	the go to pho place wile you are in vegas . definitely not the same as the one in san jose . the pho is so so but what 's to complain about when it 's 4am and you just want some pho .. the pho broth is standard issue and the rice dishes are nothing to rave about . just eat the pho to satisfy your craving for pho and go back to your hotel for a couple hours of shut eye before you hit the pool
1	well done !
1	i came here last night to get a mardi gras costume . the girls that work there were nice and helpful . there are a lot of costumes , masks , wigs and lingerie . i liked a lot of costume they had there , i wan na buy them all : ) the price was decent , they had sale too and i was able to try 3 at a time . they had dressing rooms . as i was ready to pay for my costume , some tv crew came in to shoot a tv show and i had to sign a waiver and they took my photo as well . i want to stay longer but could n't .
0	wish i had followed jayd 's advice and specifically requested jackie . i felt a proposal from my long term boyfriend was eminent ( i was right ) and wanted to get my nails done since i ( finally ! ) stopped biting mine . i was fairly pleased with the look of my french tip manicure for the first two days . however , my tech ( ca n't remember her name ) was really aggressive with cutting my cuticles even though i jerked my hands back , `` oww ! '' . now , not even a week later my polish is hideously chipping and i have little skin tags above my cuticles due to her roughness . in spite of this fabulous ring on my finger i shun at showing it to people because of my gross nails . and i was charged $ 17 for a natural nail french tip ? ! locating my polish remover now and will never return !
1	i dropped in here because they were the newest business in the sprouts plaza that i shop at pretty regularly . i 've bought several things here already : leash , harness , paleo cat food , catnip spray , and carriers . whew ! all the employees that i have interacted with have been really nice . my latest purchase was the carrier and they only had one in stock , but i wanted two . so the manager/owner ordered one right away for me . she even gave me a coupon to use for 25 % off for the grand opening celebration which was really nice of her to do for such a big ticket item . they also have a self service dog wash room in the back which would be pretty cool if i had dogs .
1	first time ordering from here and the food was great ! the price was under 25 and the delivery guy was fast very polite . the family meal said five people .. amazing .
0	simple , reasonably priced , pretty clean food in a no-frills space . heavy on the salt and oil . the husband and wife team are friendly . cash only . rating scale : 1 star : avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe . 2 star : with so many great places to choose from , why risk this one ? 3 star : i 'll try it again or consume here in a pinch . 4 star : i go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible . 5 star : i look forward to taking my wife or friends here .
1	cartel makes a great cup of coffee . a seriously great cup of coffee ( or latte , or espresso ) . the staff are helpful if you need advice about what to get , and they know their brews . i had a very interesting espresso here recently , with notes of citrus at the front and chocolate at the finish . it was ... different , but still good . this place is always busy . always . however , you should have no trouble finding at least one seat open to sit and enjoy that great cup of coffee .
0	another review of at & t wireless .... not the store . this may be a record ; they lasted less than 2 hrs for me ! after 12 years w/verizon i decided to leave so i could get an iphone . giant mistake . i called to activate my phone , and was told the activation dept . is closed . i called customer service , and got it connected . but then i called mom and she asked why i was calling from her cell phone number ? they got the numbers attached to the wrong phones . so i called customer service back , and they were closed . it was 7pm here . i dont care what time it was on the east coast ... if their customer service dept ( and tech support ) cant be open when i need them , then i dont need them . i 'm going back to verizon and im never leaving again !
1	had the spaghetti , and it was delicious . definitely better than spaghetti i 've had elsewhere , but not the best ( the best was at marea in ny ) . like another person said , the consistency of the noodles was exactly like chinese hand-pulled noodles i had growing up . the sauce was incredible . had a bit of fire , although most people would not notice unless they were looking .
0	the staff there was friendly , especially the guy assembling the pitas . i got the chicken breast pita and the chicken was grilled perfectly . they have a large selection of veggies and sauces to choose from . you can even add cheese to it . i did n't realize nor was it posted that pineapple was an option . it was an unpleasant discovery . love pineapples ... just not in a savory pita . i also wish they would heat up the pita bread . it is sort of weird biting into this rather cold pita and warm piece of chicken . it would make the pita more mailable and taste less dry . including tax it was $ 6.19 . it is fair value , not great . after a couple hours at the bar i was hungry again . noticed on the way out that they are open 24 hours . i would definitely come back if i needed a relatively healthy fix after a night out .
0	so the husband has taken my yelping as a mission to find new and better places recently . going to the copper door was his idea , but i wo n't hold it against him . on a sunday night for dinner this place was empty . well , not completely empty , there was one other couple in the entire restaurant . the atmosphere is beautiful : wonderful photographs of old phoenix , a baby grand piano , and the most beautiful ceiling tiles i 've ever seen ( not that i make a habit out of looking at the ceiling ) . we both ordered the iced tea , and it was incredibly delicious . i have a feeling that they add just a shriggle of sugar to cut down on the typical bitter flavor of tea , without making it sweet . as maria f. states , the menu does claim to have vegan options . i saw three that were labled vegan , although one contained honey . i would doubt their understanding of what is vegan food . then came our meals . mine was the artichoke and cheese stuffed ravioli with shrimp , or at least it was supposed to be . when the waiter brought out my dish , it was just plate of raviolis . i thought at first that i misunderstood , and that maybe the shrimp was inside the pasta . so i tried to cut open the pasta and i had to put muscle into it . to my dismay , no shrimp . i told the waiter that i ordered shrimp , he looked confused and said he would be back . he came back 3-5 minutes later to say that he would take my plate and be back . about 10 minutes later i get the same dried-out , hard pasta raviolis with 4 shrimp . the waiter said he put extra on . extra what ? the husband 's well-done burger was medium at best . while i was waiting for my food , he said that he had eaten better and larger burgers at seamus 's next door . luckily , the waiter did n't charge us the full $ 17 for the man 's undercooked meat patty and a side of cottage cheese , just $ 10 . and he did n't add the $ 5 to my $ 17 dish for the shrimp , not even the extra one . and the hostess saw us at seamus 's afterwards and was dissappointed about our experience . she was very helpful , nice and gave us a 15 % off coupon for lunch which she said was very good and not as pricey . i might give them another chance , but it wo n't be at dinnertime .
1	i love yogurtland . they have the best and most unusual flavors of yogurt . they have every topping you can imagine and the prices are good . my favorite is taro and they always seem to be out of that . ha- maybe because it is the best flavor !
0	i miss you , marshall fields . you were the `` fancy '' department store with the upstairs dining room , had santa bears during the holidays , carried well-curated fashions for young and old and had the best -- the best -- shoe department . i weep for you . macy 's , i keep trying to pretend you 're not any different , but i ca n't . you 're middle-of-the-road with hints at class , you 're penney 's with a red lipstick veneer , your store brand clothes are cheaply made and you called the jeans i searched high and low for an `` impulse buy '' while not honoring any coupons ( like your other stores do ) . since when are jeans an `` impulse buy ? '' macy 's , please shape up . the discerning customers of madison deserve more .
0	not again a few simple items turned into a large bill . i thought the charges were excessive and questionable services that they stated i needed . i unfortunatey did not have time for my routine mechanic , thought this would be convienent with work location . shopper beware not again for me .
0	i noticed there were 2 rittenhouse locations . this is the one off rittenhouse and ocotillio . the donuts are okay but not great . i love the coffee especially the iced mocha swirl and the iced caramel swirl latte 's but unfortunately for this locaion some of the employees do not know the difference between iced coffees and iced lattes . i try to be specific when i place my order but sometimes the person taking my order will argue with me that an iced coffee is the same thing as a latte and sure enough when my drink comes out it 's an iced coffee , definitely not a latte . this has happened to me more than a few times . i 've even spoken with the owner but it 's still happening . it 's not very fun to dread going to a place because you know you might get the wrong order no matter what you do . and i really hate having to go back thru drive thru or go back in to tell them it 's wrong . it 's happened to me both thru drive thru and from ordering in the store . maybe i will try a different location . at least starbucks get it right 99 % of the time and does n't give you attitude if you have to come back to tell them it was wrong . i think this place get 's it right 60 % of the time . it used to be 100 % but i guess they hired new people or i just started going at different times of the day and way more often . i do n't know but it 's disappointing ...
0	i will never ever come back at this store again , one staff is very rude !
0	ayce lunch here was mediocre . the nigiri was not fresh enough for me and the sushi was put together without care . i like that it 's close to my part of henderson but i have not gone back from the last time i 've been there . i would have enjoyed this spot if i came for non sushi items~~
0	i ca n't even give them one star ! first they were closed an hour and a half early . second they do n't even have signage to help you know where to go if you 've never been here before . and third the big guy inside was kinda rude in letting me know they were closed . definitely wo n't be coming here anymore . not very customer service oriented .

0	no stars ... i ordered a pizza from falbo bros ( n. sherman avenue ) in madison last july . the usual -- thick , dense , not good gluten free crust . very dense . i ordered another one on october 7th . same deal . i ordered another pizza from them on october 20th and was shocked by the crust -- light , thin , not dense , and it was amazing . but , it was too good to be true -- my boyfriend ( non celiac ) tasted it and said it tasted just like his regular crust . i emailed the company that night and asked them if they had changed their crust recently . i told them if they had not changed it , that their kitchen had made a very serious mistake and needed to be much more careful in the future . they emailed me back on october 22nd saying they 'd changed it and asked if i liked it . of course i did -- it was amazing . so ... i ordered another one on october 23 . ( ps : i am recovering from major surgery so i have been ordering in more than usual . ) october 23 was again , a wonderful crust -- and my boyfriend said it tasted just like his . my skin was itchy and i spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the gluten poison had come from but figured they had no reason to lie in the email and certainly , they would not have made the same mistake twice . we had a coupon so last week , i ordered two gluten free pizzas . amazing , wonderful pizzas . and i ate them both . and , my skin was itchy , my skin developed deep infections , and i really started to wonder where on earth i was getting into such horrible gluten ingestion . and as with any celiac , i got tired because i was unable to absorb my nutrition properly . i really did n't believe the pizza thing ... so i set out to order some gluten free home test kits . in the mean time , we ordered pizza monday night for the packer game ... and what should they deliver but their old , usual , dense crust gluten free crust that tasted horrible . i wrote them a scathing email -- that they lied about a recent crust change ( they had the same crust in july ) , that they did not ask their kitchen to be more careful , that they charged me extra for gluten free , and that their careless and negligent attitude could seriously sicken someone with severe celiac ( though , no celiac would order a gluten free pizza from a gluten kitchen , i am sure . ) no email back after i called them out on it . email copies available upon request . will do no future business with them after their careless attitude about gluten allergy .
1	yum ! it 's not hong kong , but it 's pretty darn good ! great tasting dishes . most definitely not low fat , just like the chinese like it . not super crowded on a sunday even right at noon . ( i 'm new to charlotte , so maybe the church crowd is bigger than i suspect and they may come a bit later . ) lots of other asian spots nearby , too .
1	i 've been going to sushi ko since 2000. nothing has changed in over 10 years and that 's a good thing , since the food and service has always been excellent . this place first and foremost serves traditional japanese sushi and it does a great job . if you 're looking for asian fusion sushi with weird and funky things in it and `` doof-doof '' music blaring , while bartenders shake up $ 20 cocktails , do n't even think about sushi ko . oh and i 've taken japanese exchange students to sushi ko before . they raved about it and could n't believe the how awesome the quality and authenticity was .
0	sandwich was kinda dry . not enough cheese on the cheese steak . they ran out of coke at the soda fountain . i asked them 3 times if they would fix it , they said they were too busy . there were no customers and they were sitting around arguing in some foreign language ( arabic ? ) coke did not get changed until an employee came out to get a coke and found out it was out . next time i am going to mike 's . they always have a great cheese steak .
1	located in the shoppes at palazzo casino . my original plan was to get some comps redeemed for grand lux cafe ( which is a great place as well ) . to my surprise , i had over 100 bucks available ... i do n't remember playing in the venetian poker room that much , but oh well . a bigger surprise , they had a long list of places i could use comps at , including steakhouses , and here . this is not the norm for vegas poker rooms . i guess this could be a venetian poker room review as well ; they treat their customers very well ! so i decided to try this place . i 'm very glad that i did ! my waitress isabella was very attentive , thorough , and answered any questions i had . top notch service ! the rest of the waitstaff was even friendlier . my table was periodically kept clean , and lots of refills kept coming . i was expecting to eat regular sushi , maybe a tasting menu . and i never really thought of what the samba part meant . but i looked at the menu and there were lots of options available , fusion-style : from brazilian steaks to traditional sushi rolls . i was in for an unexpected and different , yet very satisfying meal . -samba tea : this is a must try ! i forgot what they were , but they included many different types of ingredients ; the result being one of my favorite teas , if not my favorite . -bobo brazil samba roll : wagyu beef , brazilian-japanese style ... something new and amazing ! -miso-marinated chilean sea bass ... so good ! one of the best fish i 've ever had . -20oz bone in ribeye steak : juicy and delicious . loved the flavor ! goes very well with the sushisamba dipping sauces . -warm chocolate banana cake ( maple butter , banana chip , vanilla rum ice cream ) ... awesome ! service : 5/5 ; food : 5/5 ! this was a unique and awesome dining experience for me . and it looks like there 's plenty more to try ! thanks sushisamba . i would definitely come back !
1	very good pizza . had better , but still very good and worth while .
0	shopping - i hate it . except for the pga superstore - but that is another review . anyway , we were hungry , so we decided a pizza sounded good . nello 's is in the same shopping center , so we decided a pizza sounded good - plus they had beer . the inside is neat , clean , and boring . but we were there to eat pizza , so my wife had a spinach salad , and we shared a grand deluxe pizza ( pepperoni , sausage , bell peppers , onions , black olives & mushrooms ) . and , of course , beer . the service was excellent - we were immediately seated and a server appeared immediately to take our drink orders ; brought them right back , and took our order . and it was only a short wait for the food . my wife really enjoyed the spinach salad ; and the pizza toppings were above average . they pride themselves on their crust , which i found was better than average . the only reason i am giving it 3 stars is that i found the sauce rather bland . pizza is really a matter of individual taste , so others may like the pizza much better than i did . i will certainly come here again , and maybe upgrade my stars if the sauce is a little spicier .
1	my friends and i love this place ! ! ! ! ! amazing on saturday ( hip-hop & crowd pleasers ) ... their staff is very friendly and the alcohol is decently priced ... they also serve tall pabst ! i love to dance so it 's great for us ! people get there around 12-1 so you might not want to show up too early ......
1	after checking out at the hotel me and my wife were staying at , i lingered around the front desk just glancing at the newspaper that was there while my wife grabbed some coffee and went in the gift shop . while standing there , i overheard a gentleman talking to the general manager about his carpet cleaning company and how he could be of value to the property . i was impressed with what i heard so , after he was done , i told him i had overheard him speaking and was wondering if he did residential carpets as well . he said yes . i asked if he 'd drive out to ontario to do my house and he said yes , so we went over what i wanted done and he gave me a quote on the spot with no open ends . i must say , the guy was 7 minutes early so that was a huge plus . he was also very thorough with not only our tile in the kitchen and dining area but also our carpeting . there were a few pee spots on the family room carpet from the dog and , due to him being very meticulous , he was able to get them out . another thing i 'm used to with other carpet cleaners is the up-charge to remove `` tough '' stains . not this guy , he attacked them and did a great job and kept to his original estimate . the reason i will call this guy again , he called me aside and asked me if it was ok if he used a non-green chemical on my carpet to remove those pesky pee stains prior to spraying it down . that to me was huge . it showed he respected my home and well-being . i must say , we have our carpets and tile cleaned roughly every 4-6 months and our grout lines in the tile have never looked better . i was also very impressed that he left us with shoe covers at no charge . very stand-up businessman and he 's our guy from here on out . if only all home contractors could be like this guy .
1	i 've been there twice . once as just a regular patron . i found the food so good that we decided to have our office xmas party here . the second time was with 12 people in the private back room . the meal was stupendous , the service fantastic and the evening could n't have gone any better . this is just a wonderful , unpretentious jewel in scottsdale .
0	terrible customer service . was treated to rudely in front of my child and husband . will never go here again . i recommend finding a different restaurant .
0	if by `` mod '' they mean edgy and weird cuisine , okay - they 've got it nailed . unfortunately , my husband and i were , and can never anticipate again being , in the mood for such fare . we live in the area and had been in the mood for a light bite , thought renegade would offer such an option with their nice outdoor patio , large indoor bar . our first reminder that renegade had a recent turnover in ownership should have been the fact that both were fairly empty -- i 've never seen that to be the case at 7 pm . there was no one to greet us ; we had to wait for someone to find us a hostess or wait staff person to locate a table , of which there were several , to seat us . and then the menu .... i looked at it and realized it had changed . big time . both my husband and i had wanted a salad , a nice big summer salad . no such luck . there were two appetizer choices , neither of which , we were informed , were your typical salad , as the chef `` does not do '' that . so my husband opted for a steak salad which a previous reviewer , joshua j , adequately summarized . i ordered something like salad in a goblet . i was told i could send it back if it was n't to my liking . trouble was ... there were n't any other selections that were to my liking on the limited menu . the goblet salad was , to steal from another reviewer , odd . i 'd never seen anything like it and that 's not a compliment . it was poured out onto my plate , and it looked like glop . salad soup . tasted the same . dripping in whatever the dressing was supposed to be . it 's still sloshing around in my stomach a morning later . no bread basket ; the alternative was not rolls , it was crispy rye chips . crispy . almost inedible . not a good experience . not going back .
0	i normally really enjoy eating here but this last experience bothered me . i went for lunch with my sister and son . my sister and i got an app to share and were going to split a lunch entree . my son only wanted a cheese crisp and the kids combo ( which is n't much of a combo only one side and no drink included ) was 4.75 and when i asked the price for just a kids cheese crisp the waiter said it was going to 5.95. he said that there is no option to have the kids crisp by itself , they give you the adult size app crisp instead and charge full price . it 's only a dollar difference but still , less food for more money .
0	i was the only one in line , and it still took 15 minutes to get my order . when i finally received my order , they were missing half of it and almost let me walk away . when i did get the food it was cold , and the soda was semi-flat . i would not recommend this place , and will not be returning .
1	had my birthday party here saturday night with 16 of my friends . first i have to say thank you to the lady that organized everything , we communicated by text messaging , she sent me pictures of where i wanted to sit , i did get bottle service . she was very friendly and accommodating ! ! ! then we got there saturday , walked right in vip , did not stand in line or anything ( with other joints you do have to wait at least 20 min , even though you got a table reserved ) kyle the manager sat us down , we got drink right away , he was very nice & kept checking on us during the night , even though we had our own waitress that served us drinks all night . music was really good ! the band was great , but the who ever the dj was he was amazing , kept spinning nice hits , we were dancing non-stop ... overall amazing time ! ! ! yes there were creepy old guys ( i 'm 30 ! ) that sat right next to us and were watching us on how we dance , but i really felt protected because we had 2 bouncers right next to us , kind of watching over us just to make sure , the creeps do n't start anything ! ! ! i mean all those people complaining about the creeps ... listen you are at a club , what do you expect ? obviously they ca n't control who goes there ... so stop complaining and just have a great time ! we will definitely be back ! ! !
0	being a displaced jersey shore girl ( the year round residents , not the wankers from up north and ny who comprise the cast of the mtv show of the same name ) i have grown up knowing that the best basic seafood comes from little run down looking places , especially fish markets with a few tables outside the front door . i 'm not talking about seafood that is done as a form of art such as eric ripert executes at le bernardin- i 'm talking minimal preparation with little more than lemon juice , butter and old bay seasoning . the kind of food you get at the legendary berkeley seafood market in south seaside park , or used to get at spike 's market in point pleasant before they changed hands and raised prices a decade ago . i 've never been a fan of corporate restaurants , and derisively refer to red lobster as the frog lobster . my first experience with joe 's was in toledo , oh , when they opened up in 1996. back then they had an overly unctious crab soup my ex was enamored of , and more raw bar offerings . one thing that has been consistent however is the coconut shrimp , and that 's why i go there . unlike most chains and non chains alike that buy the coconut shrimp frozen and pre-breaded , joe 's breads their shrimp to order as fried shrimp should be breaded . the other thing i order is the beantown bake steampot , as it has two `` cricket '' lobsters as we call them back east plus some steamed littleneck clams just like an old time clambake . i could care less about the sausage but it 's edible , and the shrimp are okay too as are the seasoned potatoes and the half ear of corn . for the price though the lobster and clams shine- here in az a person ca n't go to the supermarket and buy two lobsters for the price that the steampot costs at joe 's ( $ 38.50 less than four weeks ago . ) i confess i do n't bother to order any of the fish filets or other items at joe 's , but i will say that they get the straightforward items right- crisp fries , fresh coleslaw without too much vinegar , sugar , salt or mayo and balanced in flavor and i do like the chutney like dip for the coconut shrimp . my bf has been going to florida for over 60 years and he likes the fried shrimp so it must be decent . maybe i 'll go there the next time i get a yen for classic fish and chips , but living in buckeye it 's easier to just do that at home . so , everything in life being relative , if you 're looking for basic fresh seafood prepared simply , eat at joe 's . anything more elaborate , wait until you 're in a town on a coast .
0	six guys without reservations on cinco de mayo fight weekend looking for a good meal found this place pretty empty at around 7.30pm . three of us joined up late and our waiter promptly took our drink orders and promptly forgot them . after our drinks showed , we ordered the baked brie for around $ 11 and the crabcakes $ 9 i think . the waiter was very pushy insisting that we orer multiples of every appetizer . we ordered more beer . my friend was so pissed that his was taking so long to show that he ordered two beers at once to make sure he would get at least one . the filet mignon at $ 23 was reasonable but i asked for mine memdiim rare , and not a drop of blood came out of it . the asparagus was cooked well , all six sprigs of it , and the mashed potatoes that were squeezed out of a pastry bag looked pretty but were too dry and lacked seasoning . overall a bargain , but definitely felt like i was paying less for less , but then again , everything else was stocked , so it was better than starving . we left and headed straight over to the speed ride to give our stomachs some excitement .
1	so grateful for the endodontic specialists ! despite all the fear i had walking into the office . dr. walker and his technician were very calm and very nice . my root canal went very smoothly and they made sure i was n't in any pain . the office was very professional and comfortable . and i am very grateful for the work they did . i would definitely recommend them to anyone !
1	my day of beef was just completed . it started with sarinana 's tamales and eggs for breakfast . lunch was portillo 's for a dog and a beef dip sammy . dinner was filet mignon at ruth 's chris . 4.5 stars . greeted by a cheerful staff , we were sat at a big table in the center of the room . this place is known for wonderful service and were not disappointed . one guy for bread and water , another for cocktails , another two for the wine . a truly professional staff dedicated to a wonderful dining experience . blue cheese olives in a dirty ketel one martini . blue cheese wedge salad . not remarkable , but very good . the petite fillet was perfectly done . pink through and through , not raw in the middle . medium was the right call . lots of haters out there who dislike the butter finish but it was really good . the gulf shrimp side portion was a great call , too . nicely seasoned , not overpowering . banana cream pie , nicely carmelized , and a delicious bread pudding were passed around the table . the entire evening was wonderful , but when it comes to a top of the line steakhouse , i want perfection , hence the 4.5 stars .
1	we got there at 6:30pm with no reservations , they were busy , so the hostess gave us a buzzer , so when our table was ready we will get buzzed , in less than 5 min . we were buzzed . ( that was super fast ) the decore inside nice , nice , the place looked great , and the the smells coming out of the kitchen you thought you were back in tuscany . it felt back home for a while.we sat in the gazibo room , the lites were nice and dimm , and the atmosphere was great . sandy was our waitress and she was very polite and spirited . her recomendations were awsome , the ceaser salads that came out were fresh and the lettuce crisp the lobster bisqe was good too.the basket with the bread that came out was nice and hot . as soon as they saw our table empty with bread they kept on coming with more , and they always refilled our drinks as well . the pasta dishes with ricotta panceta in a vodka cream sause excellent ( pasta a la vodka ) , the brazed beef with cremini mushrooms and homade noodles was great , the flavors were all there , awsome ! ! the mohitos are a little on the lite side , but it was corected from sandy.the deserts that came out in little espreso cups [ 2.50 each ] smart ! ! very good idea you can try them all . in general the experience was great and we will be back . for a chain restaurant to look that good and please their customers so well , gets 5 stars from me . pperrrffecctoooooooooo !
1	well , it ai n't cheap here . i paid $ 3.25 for two flavors in a small cup ( bigger than the normal cup size , tho , you get at frozen food stands ) , but i have to say that this is the best gelato i 've ever had ... and , frankly , you do get enough -- and it is rich enough -- to totally satisfy you with this one cup holding two flavors of your choice . lots of choices and some of them are offbeat , so the place is a veritable wonderland of fattening icy treats . frankly , my thighs do n't want to thank this place but my taste buds do . go to this place . it really is worth it .
1	this place has the most amazing food . the le potence is out of this world . they have great fondue and crapes . the staff is awesome . there is a tv in the lounge that your can watch your food being made .
0	we did n't stay at the hotel ... just stopped in for the `` original shrimp cocktail of las vegas '' ( $ 1.99 each ) . it was worth the money and we also had some of their cheap draft beer , a beerbrat sandwich and a fountain soda . only drawback ... no refills ! otherwise the shrimp cocktails were worth it . plus many other affordable eating options were closed on this particular sunday afternoon .
0	i used to love this nightclub .. great music , great vibe , but they have the worst door team . some of the employees act as if you 're doing them a favor by going in . it 's a fun place if you do n't have to interact with their employees .
1	i 've enjoyed coming here for the entire time i 've lived in las vegas and i just happen to come here 5 days a week nowadays
1	i believe the ghosts of the rat pack are inside this place . the nugget rings and the sharkskin suit on the first guy i saw confirmed it . great view , great atmosphere , huge portions . i love that they tote that they serve bottled water only . makes you wonder . the maitre 'd was the best part of our night . he was kind and accommodating when we had a few surprise guests . he told us so much history of vegas , we almost forgot to grab our table . the food was excellent , but unfortunately all of us left with over half filled plates . the atmosphere is nice and quiet , and would have been sort of romantic if my co-workers were n't with me . but another day , i 'll get me a sugar daddy and get him to take me .
0	i get their coupons in the mail every week for $ 8.25 large pizza . i called in to place my order for pick up . as i got there the cashier said $ 8.25 with the coupon . i told him that i did n't bring the coupon as i did n't think the coupon was needed . he charged me $ 12 for a terrible pizza ! ! ! ! ! taste like garbage ! i would rather of had little caesars for $ 5.00 or a frozen digiorno ! ! f this place ! i will never spend another $ $ here ! never again i will go to this s * it hole ! asian guy in the front needs to learn some customer service skills .
0	oh yelp reviewers , you have let me down . my meal at yellowfin left a lot to be desired . i was eager to try some real ramen . after reading some good reviews on yelp , ordered the pork ramen . i was starry eyed and dreaming about delicious , shoyu ramen with slices of pork belly . and ... when the dish finally arrived what did i see ? a spicy broth ? that 's ... somewhat strange for ramen . but i 'll eat it . what about the noodles ? clearly instant .... two lonely pieces of shrimp and some hard , overcooked chunks of pork that had no flavor whatsoever . the broth tasted exactly like that of shin ramyun . for a $ 11 price tag , i expect more than some instant ramen . i can get that at home . we did also try some of the sushi which was definitely better than some other options near campus . but overall , with the high prices , and the food only being marginally better ... we wo n't be back .
0	seating was atrocious . poor setup . chips were stale . salas were good .. tacos were mushy . pork belly was not crispy . nice looking little place but would not recommend .
1	, so i get a text to meet at this spot and i put the name and address together and im like wtf , makes no sense , im in , so im thinking some wannabe swank mockery of a white trash bar/grill , wrong , i was shocked and overly impressed by this restaurant/bistro 70 decor spot , the food is orgasmicly infused to take you way back to comfortable times and drinks that will blow your mind , the lemonchella blew me out of the water , one its just like my grandpa made and two , big in az . im a regular po vida unless the get a huge ego and drug problem and lose the staff/chefs .
0	nice decor but $ 8 for a pint of stella at 2pm on a monday ?
1	i pretty much go to places now if they have a good yelp rating/review , thank-you yelp . fellow yelper misit gave this place a good review , and i was in a desperate need for for a manicure since this other place i will not mention or review did me dirty . i tried to do a walk-in , but only one lady was present at the time so she got my named and phone number down , and promised to give me a call as soon as she was available . an hour later she was . it was a good sign that there was a wait for her , but even better when she called me back as promised , even sooner . i scheduled for a next day appointment , and she booked me the earliest . let me tell you , this lady angel is awesome . not only did she measure my nails , but listened to what kind of style i liked . they do n't offer 3d nail art , but she can have gems inside of your gel . it is very stylish , neat , and natural looking . she told me that doing nails is her art , and to do nails is an art . she was very down to earth with me , and did n't make me feel uncomfortable like the other place , that rushed me and my acrylics . also this place thrives on being clean . : )
1	this was a solid three-star review until i ate the sfogliatella pastry i took to go from the bakery and i had to bump it up to four stars . we were starving after a long morning of basketball , video poker and bloody marys ( me ) , and sleeping until noon ( my friend ) . so , we stopped in here because they had smallish things to eat - salads , sandwiches , soups , etc . i opted for the spinach and brie panino and was delighted that it came with a side of house salad . my friend ordered a pizza and a full-sized house salad . my panino was very good . it was also very cheesy and rich ( the brie ) so i could n't finish it all . the side salad was very nice ( lettuce , basil , olives , onions , tomatoes ) . my friend 's pizza was pretty decent - not the best thin italian-style pizza but still pretty good . it had a nice , fresh tomato sauce which i liked a lot . the service was good although it took a while for them to get to us . but , overall it was fine . when i went in to the bakery later to get a treat to take away , the ladies behind the counter were very sweet , friendly and helpful . they were so great that i returned the next day to get another sfogliatella . or , maybe it was the pastry that made me return because it was delicious : )
0	i work graveyards around the corner and this location is supposed to be 24 hours . well they lie ! ! your overnight employee locked the doors and turned the lights off on me when i walked up ! terrible business and a prime example of false advertisement ! im defiantly going to better business bureau about this ! ! screwed me out of dinner , thanks : (
0	as a local , this place is a rip off ! all tourists are getting scammed ! first of all , the venue is set up poorly so that you ca n't see anything and you waste your time and money buying drinks that are hot , over priced and water down ! our experience started by ordering a few rounds , every time we got up to dance and let our new drinks covered on the table , the waiters would come remove them . this happened 3 times and at that point we had spent over $ 200 alone on alcohol . if you are a local you are getting charged 350 % more for a beer that is shittier than any other place off the strip . it is a good concept however , poor management , business designed to rip off tourists/ customers in general and worst of all the operations manager mike kaupoe could care less that we were dissatisfied . i would n't even give this place any stars because when we asked for our money back , we were just given managers card with comped drinks that we will never get because we will never go back ! overall terrible first/last experience ! have fun getting ripped off !
0	with a name like smoothie king , i was hoping to find smoothie worthy of a crown ! what i got was a mediocre blend of frozen yogurt , a fruity syrup , and protein powder . i did n't care for it , and the stryfoam cup it came in is disappointing to my environmentalistic side . the store definitely had the chain , mass-produced feeling . however , there was quite an extensive menu , so , for a smoothie lover like me , i suppose this joint is worth more than one shot .
0	let me preface by saying the 3-stars came strictly from the food and the amazing table we had . after the lillie 's noodle house bs ( see review ) , we were irritated , flabbergasted , and hungry . we were n't in the mood to head to the strip , nor were we wanting to search downtown for a place to eat . we happened upon the grotto and snatched up a seat . we put our name in and were told it would be 20-30 minutes , not too bad . we all needed a drink and decided to head to the bard for drinks and maybe an appetizer . we sit down and look over a dinner menu . the same blonde , short-haired , older lady kept sprinting by us . after a few times , she said she 'd be right with us . after a few more times , she stops by our table to ask if we were waiting for a table in the restaurant , we said we were , and she said , `` oh thank god , that 's the best news i 've heard all night '' and goes back to the indy 500. she laps us multiple times before we flag her down to order . she took our order and began her foot race all over again . within five minutes we had our alcohol but no water . she gave us the excuse , `` it 's hard to get water around here '' and continued her sprints . i felt bad for her because it seemed she was the only one working as a bar server and she was running around frazzled and stressed , but come on , it 's not that hard to get water . she ran by at least three more times with the same excuse . i paid the tab , gave her a pretty good tip , and it was time for dinner . we never ordered our appetizer . my brother walked up to the hostess station and mentioned that it had been about twenty minutes . one of the girls said she could seat us now and then grabbed four menus and walked off in the direction of the table , leaving my brother in the middle to make the decision to get our attention or to follow speedy gonsalez . he followed her and made it to the table with just enough time for to thrown down the menus and mutter , `` enjoy '' . we eventually caught up . our table was against the glass overlooking the beautiful pool and shark tank , which was lit nicely for the evening . in need of a other drink and dinner , we checked the menu and decided what we wanted to eat . silent bob , our waiter , walked past the table multiple times , never acknowledging us . finally , after the bus boy brought us water and set down the bread and olive oil ( very good ) , our order was being taken . i think the waited maybe said four words to us . the pattern of passing our table continued until our drinks and appetizer ( bruschetta ) were ready . the bruschetta was amazing ! dinner came out about twenty minutes later and was delicious . i ca n't recall what we ordered because i was so appalled by the whole evening . first , we 're basically told that we 're not wanted in lillie 's and then we 're basically ignored at grotto . the food here was good , deserving of a full five star rating . too bad service counts in my book , this restaurant barely deserves my generous three-star rating .
0	my husband and i went here this evening for the experience . well i have to say , our experience kinda sucked . the `` nurse '' who was our waitress really was n't into having fun it seemed . she was just take the order , and then we did n't see her again until she brought the food , and then not until she put the bill on our table . we wanted to have fun too . its more hyped up than what it really is . they put you in a hospital gown and then i guess that is it . i had the single bypass burger , my husband had the triple , we split the greasy fries , and split a chocolate butter shake , it made me throw up all night long . my husband was sick after eating there . i checked my pulse on the machine they have , and when i left it was 109. wow . so anyways the food was not to great , i have definitely had better . it really is just for if you want to say you did the experience . nothing else , and i will not eat here ever again .
1	delivery until 3 am ! sit down seating available . there is something for everyone on this menu . good selection of vegetarian options . try the house salad and the won tons ! not really mexican food , more mexican-inspired .
0	divey yet smoke-free sports bar with good food ? ! found it all here ! granted , the food is from the badger caf\u00e9 next door ( separate review ) , but it 's handy how they 've partnered up for business and seems to benefit both . bartenders were friendly and female , plenty of tvs tuned to both mlb and nba games- counted 10 screens , and that 's just from the front area where i stayed . in addition to bar seating , there are long family-style tables , also pointed at various screens . did n't notice any built-in gaming consoles , but that 's not my style anyway . come for the game , stay for the food . friendly patrons as well ! can not stress how pleased i am to find this atmosphere in a smoke free environment .
0	great cobb salad , lamb burger was alright but nothing great .
0	mexican diner ( note : not dinner , diner ) in southpark . mediocre . staff - all of them - have no basic hospitality skills . take it to park rd shopping center .
0	i do n't really like but review just i do n't recommend no one -go there because i swear i will never ever go back there even it is for free
0	the bistro buffet at the palms is not among my top ten favorite buffets in las vegas , as the food can be tepid to cold , the meats selection can be dry , and the specialty coffee is served from an automated machine that is far less superior than my tiny dolce gusto machine at home . but they do get top marks for their lebanese section , and picking from its vast selection is almost worth the money if you like stuffed grape leaves , spinach pies , lebanese chicken , lamb gyro , and some of the best falafel this side of the strip . they also make mean pistachio rice pudding that others have raved about as well . considering a single plate of these ethnic dishes might cost around $ 8 in a decent food court , their $ 12 lunch is a good deal if you want something a bit beyond fast food . other than that , i would give it a pass .
0	no thanks . stopped in for a drink and dinner with a girlfriend on a weekend and was far from impressed . one star for the pretty view from the balcony and one star for the friendly waitress . beyond that everything was disappointing . we ordered an appetizer and a salad to share . we had the seared ahi tuna medallions and the seafood salad . the tuna was fine , but not great for the price of almost $ 11 for a couple of thin slices . the seafood salad was pathetic .. it had one tomato halved , one egg halved , shitton of lettuce and two shrimp on the top . yes two shrimp for $ 16.00 . oh yeah , it also had a scoop of imitation crab on the side . the drinks were $ 5.00 which i thought was reasonable . it was a sugar filled mess with no alcohol .. so i asked for a double shot in my drink ... she charged me for the price of two drinks ... so it was $ 10 ( strip price ) for one drink in some below average dump in middle of hendertucky . the tab for one appetizer , one salad and a couple of drinks was $ 61 before tip . never again
0	the beef cheeks ravioli was the highlight of the meal -- the chop salad was just okay , and i make a better ribeye at home on our grill , unfortunately . still a really nice restaurant , but for $ 400 for two people , i would have wanted it to be a very memorable steak .
1	nelson and his employees have always been great to work with ... i recently stopped in their gilbert office and explained that my daughters apartment had a major issue with pests ... he basically gave me a $ 50 value for $ 15 .... they have come and done our house a number of times and help us identify other problems and issues that we were unaware of ... their prices are always very reasonable ... thanks magic pest ! ! !
0	awful restaurant ! this place used to be awesome when it was lolita 's . the new-age mexican food they offered was flavorful and every dish was a culinary experience . since this place became coconuts the food has turned to crap . everything we tried was overcooked , under seasoned and swimming in tasteless sauce . tables were sticky and dirty , not tablecloths , and poor service given . do yourself a favor and do not come to eat here . it 's a waste of time and money .
0	overrated . i got one of the `` supreme '' hotdogs or whatever which was a dollar more ( $ 9.50ish ) . it sounded good , brat cooked in beer , covered with saurkraut and bacon . the brat was as big as a pointer finger and the pretzel bun was slightly larger than a dinner roll . so picture pig in blanket with much larger roll and a pig that 's just a little bigger . not proportional , and kind of messy - people get this off a truck and are able to eat it without a fork and knife ? ? the pita bread with pimento cheese was actually very good , however , the bread was so greasy . we were thinking we should go back for this and beer , but realized its probably not a great idea . maybe the dogs off the truck are a little bigger ? it would definitely have to be several dollars cheaper for this to work .. the beer selection was pretty good though and value priced .
0	i was looking to get away from the wsop last night for awhile and stopped by this little mexican restaurant up the street . what a mistake . i do not like to post terrible reviews unless they are truly warranted . this was my experience . when i arrived there was one other table occupied and that should have been a clue . i sat down and after asking for water a gruff man ( the owner ? ) came back with a water and chips/salsa . the red salsa was the one good part of the night while the green salsa was bland and tasteless . i asked to place my order right away . i ordered a burrito with green chile ( pork ) as i usually use this basic dish to judge mexican restaurants . it was $ 9 . first i received some starter soup that was was overly salty and plain . then , i sat there for about 20 minute in which one additional party arrived and my water ran out . my waiter never came back once during this time . when this other party got their food first ( after ordering 10 minutes after me ) i began to hope the food would be special to make up for it . my food finally arrived and that forced the waiter to finally acknowledge the lack of water . my immediate impression was that it looked great , a wet burrito with cheese and green sauce that came with rice/beans . i started on the sides and they were basic and satisfactory . then i made the mistake of eating the main course . i cut into the burrito and immediately saw it was filled with little cubes of waxy meat . the first taste was n't any better . it was n't like any chile verde or green chile i 've ever had . there was the hideous meat , overcooked tough chunks of pork . i 've never had stewed or marinated pork with this texture/consistency . a few pieces of onion and chiles was also inside but nothing else and there was very little green chile flavor . my initial thought was to ask for a refund but i do n't like to do that so i literally picked out the meat and ate most of the wet tortilla and cheese only . that 's how bad it was , and i still tipped around 15 % against my better judgment . i just do n't understand how they can serve meat/food this terrible . i 've yet to find decent mexican food in las vegas but even this was the bottom of the barrel . the lack of any discernible service was the icing on the fail cake .. do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant . i 'd rate it a zero if i could .
0	well i really like this place . so why only three stars ? well my food was cold . i ordered meatball sliders and they were really cold when i got them . too bad too or else i would have rated this between a 4 and 5 star place . other than that , service was great . theater is wonderful ! sat in the premium seats . awesome way to watch a movie . the seats recline electrically and they give you a blanket . compared to the other place over on 24th and camelback , this place has a little more of an edge . i do like the call button at the other place a little better but service here was good enough it was not needed . i will go back and hopefully food will be better next time . the other thing is food is kinda pricey .
1	round corner cantina definitely accommodates the hipster crowd and is n't ashamed to make it painfully obvious . having said this , i really enjoy their drinks and their food and have been lucky enough to dodge the sour bartender and poor service i 've been hearing about . i have to stress that you really ca n't walk into the round corner cantina expecting to be served promptly . i would n't walk in with an empty stomach . instead , i 'd bring some good company that you do n't mind passing the time with . i 'd order a few drinks and get lost in conversation and be pleasantly surprised when my comes . it 's not a restaurant , it 's a bar that serves food and it functions as one . on nice , warm nights the outside seating fills up fast and they do not seat you . it is every man and woman for themselves but both times i 've been , i managed to snag a table without any problem . the food is fresh and tasty . their tacos are pretty authentic with a bit of portland thrown in . every so often you 'll get a pretentious piece of this or that but all in all , they 're pretty close to the real thing . the drinks are mixed well and done right , using quality alcohol and a nice touch . go into round corner knowing that the service is hit or miss and that it might take a while to get a seat , it 'll make you less surprised and offended when you 're not treated like an eater so much as a bar goer , waving the five between your two fingers around in the hopes that you get noticed .
1	i decided to have a food adventure with my girlfriend and based on all the positive yelp reviews , we picked the lemongrass cafe . i am so glad we did ! ! we had the most wonderful experience . it was our first time at a vietnamese restaurant and our server , lisa was super helpful ! we ordered the shrimp toast as an appetizer . when it came out it also had gorgeous fresh herbs and lettuce on the plate.lisa explained to us that you wrap the shrimp toast in the lettuce with the fresh herbs and use the dipping sauce . i never would have known what to do ! ! let me tell you , it was delicious ! ! ! the bread it was on was fantastic ! we decided to try the pho , my first time ! it was a warm bowl of goodness ! once again , lisa was super helpful and so friendly and told us we might want to put some cirracha ( sp ? ) hot sauce in our pho ... this just added another yummy dimension . we also met the owner , tansy , she was a lovely woman also . let me say that our adventure was awesome ! i cant wait to go again ! ! !
0	over priced burnt coffee , bad service , breakfast sandwich was greasy
0	it was ok. we went for the $ 5.99 lunch special . good deal , right ? kinda ... i got the chicken wrap with fries . the lady got the chicken breast with mashed potatoes and vegetables . the chicken wrap tasted like it was drenched in tapatio ... not so great . i 'm not that picky but i had a hard time finishing it . the chicken breast was good though . no complaints . not much flavor , but still good . service was what you 'd expect for lunch time . i 'm not big on service , so no complaints . i ca n't really complain since it was under $ 13 after tax for two in vegas . probably wo n't be back , but hey ... no regrets .
0	my first few trips to seven saints were excellent . the place had just opened . the service was excellent . this would have been a four star review had that not changed . perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place . the menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out . the appetizers are well done and set up to share , though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the seven sinners plate had that ' i 've sat in cold storage ' flavor to them . that said , the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent . i liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider . the triple-s plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad . i was sorry to see that go . i 've not tried the specials , and each time i 've been everyone has done sliders , sandwiches , soup , or salads - so i cant speak to them . the desserts are nothing special , but were decently presented . out first few trips , the staff was excellent . we were seated relatively quickly despite being packed . someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes . the waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends . the beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong . while prices were a bit on the steep side , we were fairly happy . on a later trip , the service was slow , the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup , and to be frank - i felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree . that was too bad as the people i was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks . if the place was crowded , i could have understood , but it seemed sort of empty . other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel . it 's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so i 'm assuming they use the same architects , designers , and back-office staff . that said , i kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service seven saints could warrant four stars .
0	service was horrible tonight . very nice people just very slow . ordered appetizer and meal . meal came but no appetizer . manger came said he would put appetizer order in on him . appetizer came out without all the sauces mentioned and well after i was done with meal . received bill and should have received 10 & off for veteran 's appreciation .... received no discount , and were billed for both meals plus the appetizer . this place needs some serious work . nice people but severely lacking in service . horrible since the options in laveen are limited .
0	ok ... so i 'm torn on this place ... it 's good in some regards and not in others . and while i 'd like to go back because our bartender was awesome ... i 'm not sure that i will . sat at the bar last night to have a drink and dinner . so , i can only vouch for the bar service portion of the place . the good : - bartenders are super friendly ... busy but friendly and very accomodating - marc the bartender is awesome ! - the street tacos ... really tasty ... the best one we had was the ensenada style fish taco ... get it ! the fish is juicy and tender ... the beer batter is super light and crispy - complimentary chips , salsa and black bean dip ... the chips were hot , crunch and had just the right amount of salt the not-so-good : - they do n't ... repeat ... do n't ... have a drink menu . um .... hello ... do n't you have any specialty margaritas that we can read about instead of having to grill the bartender about what 's good ? - red sangria tasted like fruit punch ... no fruit floating in it and i could n't taste the wine - we got there during happy hour time ... but no one ... told us about it ... we overheard that bartenders talking about it and the different prices for drinks during that time ... but were we told so that we could take advantage ? nope . - cadillac margarita is ( as we found out by looking at the check ) not part of happy hour specials ... and while it was presented nicely ... did n't taste like a cadillac ... nor was it served with the grand marnier shot on the side ... which is my favorite part - ceviche ... 'eh ' ... it was ok ... we got the sampler for $ 12 ... do n't waste your money on it ... get the street tacos - i think they were short a bartender and a cocktail waitress because marc was crazy busy
1	i used to buy some dope drum n bass records here .
0	first time trying them out . sample of the cake was amazing . wish i could say the same about the girl working the counter . acted like she had more important things to do . felt like she could n't wait to get me out the door to get back to whatever she was doing before i walked in . thank god the cakes are amazing ! ill go back but probably to another location .
1	getting ready to leave on a flight home the next morning , we would get a small snack and drink at chili 's which was located a block from our hotel . have gone to our neighborhood 's chili 's which i consider just an average restaurant . we sat in the bar area . it was just before 4 pm and the waitress came back and said that it was happy hour and the appetizers were $ 4.99 . we ordered 2 - one flat bread pizza and some kind of nachos . i was surprise of the size of the plates . we were totally satisfied . the service and 2 of the staff we dealt with were so nice . can pay electronically from the table which we really liked . highly recommend for a snack or bar drink .
0	okay i 'm a fan of the bk lounge , but wow ... not at this price . pros- * bk in the airport ... awesome ! * super fast speedy service * crispy hash brown ... mmm . * condiments and plastic-ware station for customers * cooler with orange juice/ milk/ chocolate milk * clean cons- * price ! ! * no value items tips- * if you can avoid eating at the airport , do it because the prices are ridiculous . i ordered a breakfast combo and an extra orange juice . the total came up to right under $ 13.00 ! * order your fries without salt to assure you get piping hot fries ( or hashbrowns ) then you can add your own salt at the condiment counter . * if you are at the airport waiting ... keep your cup and you can take advantage of their beverage station ( free refills ) *
0	oh cj 's , how you 've changed . back when cj 's first opened it was almost like a small taste of home being from austin . the meat ( esp . the ribs ) melted in your mouth , the greens were the right texture and firmness and they even had the delicousness that is blue bonnet ice cream all served in a comfy little area with picnic tables . well , i do n't really live on that side of town so i kind of forgot about it until recently this past weekend when i happened to be next door to it . well , i was told by the person at the front that they are under new ownership and i have to say , food wise this place has changed . there was a little construction going on and since it 's under new ownership that 's understandable , but the place just seemed dead which is the complete opposite of when i first went there . i ordered the ribs , beef brisket , greens , and mac and cheese . let 's start with the sides first : the greens - still delicious , with a hint of bacon in them , the m & c - not bad , pretty good no real complaints , the beef brisket - tender , but wayyyy more fatty than i last remember and a little saltier too but still not bad . however , the ribs i 'm sorry but i have to give them a solid d- . they were rubbery , barely seasoned , chewy and gristly , and no amount of their delicious barbecue sauce could compensate for their overall lack of quality . i could n't even get the dog to eat the leftover ribs , and that 's saying something since he would probably eat a rock covered with barbecue sauce if his teeth were strong enough . i do n't know if this is due to new ownership and changed meat quality or if maybe my taste buds have changed since i was last there but this is not how ribs are supposed to be . well cj 's if you go back to your old self , me and the fam will come back more frequently but if this is what you 're doing with your ribs , i think i 'll just stick with lucille 's bbq over in the district .
0	keep on walking ...... my friend and i each tried different dishes and shared . he got nice roast and i got a hamburger . the place is really nice .... open , bright .... .. but the food is just a big disappointment . a hamburger + 2 good beers was $ 37 . expect to pay a lot for your food here . both dishes were poor ..... sorry , really wanted to like this one ....
1	very nice little place . it sort of reminded me of the place before it became bigger and lost a bit of quality . great portion sizes and even better prices .
1	service is great and the atmosphere is cool . my gf and i are fans of tgi friday and have been to multiple ones in vegas . i just hate to say but the food at this one was not nearly as good as the other ones . we were disappointed because at places like this you look for consistency but this one was n't prepared as well as when we went to the others . the service and everything were great which is why i gave it a 4 star but i will definitely just go to the other ones .
0	super clean and bright store and very well organized . i looked and looked for what i went in to purchase and after walking right by it several times someone actually came up and asked what i was looking for . she did n't think they had it but looked for me and sure enough ... the second pair of eyes worked ! the employee who helped me walked to a register , opened it for me and checked me out . pretty good service overall .
1	this was my first time in this restaurant and i have to say that i was amazed at both the service and food . i would recommend this to anyone in phoenix heading downtown . we will be back for sure !
1	i realized i had written my review of cup cakes for urban cookies instead of ollie cake . oops ! mea culpa ! ollie cake has a great rotation on weekly cup cakes . i love cup cakes . as much as i try and cut back , it is my down fall . i figure if i 'm going to eat them , i might as well eat the best , so i do n't feel guilty ! the pros : + cakes are perfectly moist . + lots of frosting ( i hate when some cup cake companies skimp on the frosting ) . + flavors are inventive ( blackberry mojito , smores , moscow mules , white russian ) + butter cream is light . cons : + butter cream is too light . that 's it ! price is extremely reasonable . $ 2.50 a cup cake ! and they won cup cake wars ! ! how cool is that ? !
0	7.14.12. after two months of waiting for someone to replace screws into the concrete block wall from the broken security gate -- the company finally fixed this . they also finally completed the pony wall 6 months later . we got the landscaping contract after the job was finished last year , as we were afraid our plants would die , and we wanted some insurance . well , the landscaping crew just came yesterday . it does not appear that they trimmed any of the plants/lantanas or trees . there are two plants that died . we have generally had to wait months before the plants have been replaced . we 'll see how long it takes them to replace the two that died . take a look at the pictures and tell me whether it looks like our yard has been serviced by a professional landscaping company .
0	the location really hurts this theater ( being in a mall ) . 2 things will be guaranteed with this experience : crowds and kids . things that can ruin any cinematic experience . additional tip : assuming it 's because of the mall location , but this harkins theater charges more than the others ... it 's true .
0	sushiya is nestled between two other much bigger buildings on dalry road near haymarket and if you blink you 'll probably miss it as it 's only around a third of the size of its neighbours . my little sister is somewhat obsessed with all things japanese , so when she came up to visit last month , she jumped at the chance of eating at an authentic japanese restaurant . we had inari and chicken yakitori for starters ( along with a cup of very unremarkable green tea ) which were both very nice but perhaps a tad too pricey at what amounted to \u00a33 a mouthful . fearing the same cost/size ratio from the sushi we opted to order from elsewhere on the menu . i had chicken teriyaki ( with a bowl of miso soup ) whilst my sister plumped for a bowl of chicken ramen ; and by bowl i mean vat - that dish was freakin ' huge ! both are fairly staple dishes for a japanese restaurant and were equally acceptable if not outstanding but what struck me about both ( especially when taking into consideration what i said about the size of the starters ) is that this place 's portion control is way out of whack - the mains were huge and i struggled to finish mine , my sister gave up halfway through . that 's not the worst thing in the world but i ca n't help but feel that i would have been happier paying slightly less for a portion i could have comfortably managed . that 's not to sound like i 'm being cheap ( besides the non sushi mains a very reasonably priced anyway ) it 's just that i 'm begrudged to leave food i 've paid for . as opposed to stole . obviously . the service was okay and the waitresses were friendly enough but we did wait for around forty five minutes for our main courses to come . as for its facilities , the interior is small but well kept . it just about barely escapes feeling cramped when full but that 's the kind of setting you come to expect from communal eating bars like these . size then is an obvious limitation for small lunch bars so it proved to be somewhat surprising when customers were continually turned away due to the establishment being full despite the fact that there was an unoccupied `` reserved '' table big enough for a party of seven who ( i learned from overhearing the waitresses ) were already over half an hour late . surely this is n't good business sense ; i understand that a reservation of seven is certainly better than the prospect of no custom at all but at the same time there needs to be a line drawn where you lose your reservation and it 's your fault . the seven eventually swaggered in with no hint of apology or excuse as to their tardiness . i hated them a little bit . whinge and moan from me then - and it 's certainly not directed at the restaurant itself it 's more because a ) i deplore lateness and b ) i really want to see little restaurants like this stay open ; they 're three a penny in other parts of the world but we genuinely do n't have all too many of them in the uk and it 's poorly behaved customers along with the reluctance to discipline them ( i.e . by cancelling their reservation ) which threaten their very existence . all in all then , sushiya proved very acceptable for a saturday lunch . i 'm not all too sure i 'd go out of my way to go there again , or that the mood would ever strike me to just pop along ; but for aficionados of japanese cuisine , it 's certainly worth a look . the water situation : water served happily and without fuss .
0	i made plans for lunch with one of my republic friends and we decided to give breadfruit a try . i had read mixed reviews , but figured they had worked all of the kinks out by now . my take ? the food was fresh but not savory or super-tasty . i started with the plantain avocado spring roll . the chutney was delicious and saved the dish . without it ? i probably would n't have bothered . my entree was the jerk chicken . overall , there was a good amount of heat with no depth of flavor . my friend ordered the jerk shrimp and was n't impressed . she even complained that the slaw was under-seasoned and bland . overall , it 's one of those things ... i guess it 's hard to keep things seasoned and juicy when you have a big lunch rush . plus , the restaurant was really warm , temperature-wise . it 's a small space with the kitchen just off the dining area , so it might have been radiating from there . there are several vegetarian and vegan options on the menu , which is a plus . i will definitely be back for another try -- possibly to try the curried tofu .
0	i was really disappointed . i would describe this establishment as frumpy , dated , and in desperate need of a facelift . the atmosphere is dark and lost in the early 70 's . the food was below average . being from the northeast , perhaps my expectations were too high , however nothing measured up to even average . i would not recommend dining here .
0	the location , ambiance and service is wonderful and the food is better than most mexican restaurants in town . i am comparing it to any other mexican restaurant because they adulterate many of the non-gmo and organic ingredients advertised . disappointing .
0	hate when people vent on here about bad experiences , so please skip if you do n't want to hear my rant . it 's not all bad , despite a bad experience with one person , we had a great night . we went to the double door on sept 20th to see the guitar freak genius called reignwolf . the venue is cool in a historic dirty blues club way ( hey clapton 's played here ! ) , the beers are cheap and cold . unfortunately the doorman is a real tool , i 'd bought 8 tickets online for me and group of friends and coworkers . i arrived first with 3 others and 15 minutes later a second group of two people arrived ( 6 total ) - it was then the doorman told me i had used up all my tickets . tried explaining we still had two more tickets and was basically told to `` go f $ & @ myself '' . tickets were just $ 10 , but sucked to be accused of being a thief . anyway , we had to purchase more tickets at the door . the band was great and we had good time anyway . guess the best advice , just pay at door .
0	i 'm sad to say that after a really great first experience over one year ago , friday night 's dinner at monty 's was very disappointing and i probably wo n't come back any time soon . the host at the counter was not friendly . my sandwich came on bread that was literally hard as a rock and then my husband was done eating before i even started my dinner because i sent it back and waited for new bread . the bread the second time around was greasy and the sandwich itself was dripping in grease . gross . my husband ordered the fish fry and they forgot part of his order . it was just a bad day for monty 's .... i might be back for dessert someday .
1	there 's just not much that can go wrong with deep fried chicken ! the meat fell apart so easily , and it was so tender and juicy . the outside was really flavorful and crunchy , and the chicken was extremely hot , fresh out of the fryer . dat sauce tho ! dip it , drizzle it , drench it , bath it , slurp it , lick it , either way it 's d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. texas toast ! i was thinking that this would be like french toast when i heard about it , but it 's more like a really yummy dinner roll . coming back to raising cane 's again .
0	i 've been here twice : the first time i really liked it , the second time , not so much . unfortunately , i ca n't even remember what entree i ordered the first time ! ? ! ? ! we especially made the detour from the strip to the orleans for big al 's . i felt extremely out of place , everyone there was so old ! ! i think we were the only ones on the premises that were under 40 years old . it 's an oyster bar , so of course you got ta order the raw oysters and clams on the half shell , correct ? correct . very fresh ! i like the clams a lot more than the oysters . clam chowder is also a must get . it 's definitely not the best i 've had , but it 's good . on the salty and thick side , but perfect with bread . and you 'll scoop up at least a clam or two with every bite ! that 's a lot of clams ! : ) beer battered soft shell crab has that yucky metal taste to it . a little bit of that taste is of course acceptable with seafood , but not this . the strange little cup of fruit salsa it came with was also yuck . do not order the chicken pesto panini . the chicken was dry , oh so dry ! my bf told me not to eat it at all , but i had to - i hate wasting food .
1	still get great service here no matter what time of day or night . another local business to support , especially with all the big boxes surrounding him . gantzel farms used to be the only place to go years ago - i still visit them whenever i can . support the mom and pops in your local area !
1	burmese is my favorite cuisine on the face of the earth and i was very excited to stumble upon this place . i 'll try to strike a balance between my obvious enthusiasm for burmese food and my perhaps unrealistic standards -- i tend to compare every burmese place to burma superstar in san francisco , and burma supertar ruby burma is not . the tea leaf salad was indeed delicious . not the best i 've ever had , but it was quite good . if you 're new to burmese , make absolutely sure you order this dish . the shan noodles had good flavor , too , and were appropriately pungent . the byo wine policy is lovely . i gather this place is newish . i hope they make it and i hope they continue to improve . the staff and service were very nice , attentive , and eager , but it seemed like a little something went wrong with everything . our appetizer could be picked up by a hair cooked into it ( these things happen , i know , and they kindly replaced it ) . after clarifying that the shan noodles were vegetarian and that we needed all our food vegetarian , the noodles were served with chicken soup . they forgot about the tea leaf salad and so had to ask us about it after we had already eaten the other things , so it was more or less a delayed salad dessert . again , they were very nice , but not a great sign that this was how things went on a friday night when the place was nearly empty . hard to imagine what a busy night would be like . nevertheless , these kinks can easily be worked out and i hope they are . the restaurant has a lot of potential . finally , one more recommendation in case the restaurant looks at these reviews . a slightly expanded repertoire of burmese dishes on the menu might go a long way . in particular , samusa soup would be a great add , and it would be nice if coconut or saffron rice were available with the main courses . but of course , this is my burma superstar standard creeping in .
1	i think this place literally saved my life a couple of weeks ago . as my husband and i trudged down the strip at 9pm in what was still 157 degree heat , we looked up and noticed what we thought was a mirage .... the glowing neon lights of the cvs pharmacy . we dragged our behinds in .... desperately seeking life saving water .... the lines were super long , there were drunken people trying to cut in here or there and i think we probably paid $ 3 per bottle of water .... but sooooo worth it at that moment .... i owe you big time , cvs ! ! ; )
0	the food is delicious - rating has nothing to do with that . i have been to crispy crepe in the past and have had a wonderful experience . however , my visit this morning was disappointing . the place was packed with a 15 minute wait for two people , but we were sat quicker than that . since we 've been there before , we knew what we wanted to order - 2 simple crepes . after 20 minutes of no food , our server came by and apologized , saying that it should be right up , that the kitchen was very backed up . ten more minutes went by and we still got nothing . there was a man who seemed to be the manager wandering around so my mom went to speak with him regarding our orders . he had no idea we had been waiting 30 minutes for our food . our server came by again and elaborated on the reason why we had been waiting so long - that their ticket machine was not working properly and some orders had not been printed , then all of a sudden several were printed all at once , causing a mishap and back up . we understood this and were glad that she was honest about what was going on . right after this , our food came . it was hot , fresh , and tasted great . our server was very apologetic about our experience . however , we received our bill and expected at least one of our meals to be comped - or at least something else offered for our extremely long wait for only two easy meals . we were charged fully with no apology from the manager . so , we called him over to explain how we felt . rather than trying to accommodate and apologize for the inconvenience we experienced , he basically just told us `` 30 minutes is a typical wait for food on a sunday '' . i proceeded to tell him that we had been there before and had no such experience . he then questioned me `` was that a sunday ? '' and after i said yes he simply raised his eyebrows . no apology or honest explanation about the mixed up/backed up orders in the kitchen . he reluctantly gave us a 15 % discount off of our meal . thanks for the $ 3.00 off . i will definitely question whether to give my business to someone like this again .
0	i have only been here once and i ordered a turkey burger thinking i could n't go wrong , but i was . i felt like it needed a lot of salt and other seasoning . honestly , it tasted like cardboard ! the unsalted , unseasoned sweet potatoes were just as bad . it was just ok for an organic entr\u00e9e . i guess you just have to either change your mentality , life style or be a vegan to enjoy this place . this is a fox concept , so expect a clean modern decor .
0	it 's funny how a place can get some things so right and others totally wrong . i once had a big argument with a friend about how a chicken kebab is n't actually that unhealthy - grilled chicken on a pitta bread , with salad . `` yeah but what about the garlic mayo and chilli sauce ? '' `` well yeah , but mcdonald 's do n't put burger sauce on their calorie count , do they ? '' 1 - 0 wallace . anyway , the kebabs in this place are excellent . beautifully seasoned and genuinely tasty , and cooked on a charcoal grill . the salad is actually pretty good too , not just the usual chopped red cabbage ( why do kebab shops think this is ok ? ) . that said , the curries are no where near as good . my friend had a bhuna ( obviously , we 're northern ) and it had about half an inch of grease laminating the top . the actual curry tasted fine , but he had a slippery face afterwards . go for the kebabs , nothing else .
0	i heard a lot about the place from the local people and were real excited to try it out . for appetizer , we ordered the sconnie egg . the meat was dry and quite honestly it is tasteless . they tried to add flavor by putting a lot of the mustard source on the bottom but it is too salty . i think it would have worked better with a different kind of mustard . we had the poutine as well . this is a dish that is gaining its popularity here in the us . the fries and gravy are good but the cheese are sticking together but overall it is a b+ . as for dinner we ordered the hamburger . the meat was tough . hands down the old fashion is a lot better . the up side there are a big selection of beer and it is a cool place just to hang out for a pint or two with no food please .
1	my daughter and i stopped in for lunch . for me , it was my first time for lunch . have been there many times for dinner . the server was polite but the lunch was fantastic . we were brought wonton chips and a salad . i had the shrimp pan fried noodles which is the best in the valley and my daughter had the szechwan orange chicken with white rice . our meal came out really fast . my daughter has only an hour for lunch and the service was amazing . the portions were not as large as dinner , but we could have made a dinner meal from the amount of food that was brought out . everything was tasty and filling . my daughter brought half her meal home . by far , this is one of our favorite asian restaurants .
1	this place is awesome . we had the ramyun and its so flavorful and yummi . i specially loved the egg inside . we were lucky because we came early for lunch and we found a table but within minutes there was a line up . tables clear out quickly tho .
0	i stopped in this morning before a business flight . i ordered a croissant with bacon , egg , and cheese and a medium iced chai . i received my beverage right away . it took a little while for my croissant . the croissant was a huge disappointment . it had only crumbles of bacon which were burned . the egg substitute was square and thick like a sponge . the cheese was also thick and yellow . i just could n't imagine eating this so i threw away the majority of the sandwich . also , i sat in one of the brown chairs along the window . i do n't believe the insides of these chairs are ever cleaned . while i was sitting in one of the chairs the young lady who was sweeping the floor used the same broom to sweep food out of a chair . i was horrified . my chai tea was fine .
0	came here by fluke , were actually looking for another place.attractive looking place , service very quick , efficient , and happy to see you out just as quickly and efficiently . we were a party of 2 , ordered the general tao chicken , and the beef ribs in honey sauce , along with vegetable fried rice and a bottle of cabernet sauvignon . a pot of tea arrived lickety split , followed by the wine , and then our dishes.the general tao was standard , the beef ribs in honey sauce , little better than rubber erasers in some nonhoney sauce.the vegetable fried rice ... standard as well . we had n't even finished our meal and the waitress was already clearing our table ! what , they were expecting some vips , party of a few hundred perhaps ? ? better to check out other restos in the area , much better food with same or better prices , and no one eager to see you go .
0	i was shocked at the price of this buffet . vegas has gone sky-high from the good old days . the buffet was terrible and my oatmeal was cold by the time i got through the line . will never go again .
0	i really wanted to give this place a better rating , i really did . the food at king 's kitchen is amazing ( though a tiny bit pricey ) and the restaurant seems to have a really great purpose . however , after the treatment we got on our anniversary i doubt i 'd ever go back . my husband and i went to the restaurant to celebrate eleven years of marriage . we were expecting a special event , especially after reading all the glowing reviews . what we got was a waitress who treated us like dirt , while treating her only other table at the time like old friends . we sat at our table , and when we saw a woman roll her eyes as she stared our way i whispered to my husband `` oh man . i hope she 's not our waitress . she looks like she hates us already ! '' lucky us , here she came . she said nothing about specials , gave us no suggestions , had to come back to hear our drink orders twice , and all we ordered was tea . and ten minutes later , when a couple of women sat in her section across from us , we got the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies , telling them in detail the specials and what came with them , which dishes were good and even telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was sold out . what ? and while our appetizer sat on the counter where we could see it , she held a ten-minute conversation with these ladies about the conference they were attending and oh my gosh , we 're all from the same hometown ? what a coincidence ! let 's talk some more ! after that the loud plunk as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the restaurant . before we could even request a refill on our tea , she was gone , back to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interrupted . we did n't get our food for forty minutes , during which time we got to watch our neighbors , who arrived fifteen minutes after us , dig into two plates of delicious-looking food . by the time we got our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the restaurant for an hour and twenty minutes and we were actually feeling like nuisances . we honestly should have complained to a manager , but we had to get to our other anniversary plans . if i had it to do all over again i would have said something . as it is they 've lost us as customers . if i 'm going to pay that much for dinner , i 'd like to be treated like a human being at least . the funny thing is the ladies and that waitress had more than their hometown in common , and though i 'd hate to think prejudice came into play , it seems to be a very plausible possibility . i just do n't know why a woman who is so friendly to other people could look at us and decide we were worthless scum without knowing us . but that 's what happened . the difference in the way they were treated and the way we were treated was astoundingly obvious .
1	great atmosphere ... started with the guacamole which was very good . drinks were out of this world great . had shredded beef tacos and enchiladas which were both very good also .
1	it 's been six months that i 've been eating thin crust pizza from windy city . it was time to delve into the deep dish . i 've eaten the sausage ( $ 18.75 ) , and two specialty pizzas ( $ 21.50 ) : wcbnp and the meat lovers . all are great , but the meat lovers is my favorite . the deep dish here is n't overly thick which i love because i like a good crust to sauce to toppings ratio . they get it right . the crust is buttery and delicious ; it crisps beautifully so it can support the weight of the toppings ( weak crust is another pet peeve ) . toppings are fresh and so many combinations are possible . and it reheats well in the oven or toaster oven . they have 50-cent wings on tuesdays . i 've finally tried those now , too . they are meaty , never greasy , yet super crispy . my preference is the chicago hot , with no ranch or blue cheese . it has a nice kick and it 's loaded with flavor . it 's nice to actually taste hot wings . they 've had awesome specials for blackhawks games , like buy a pizza , get one free . and coming up july 4th . they 'll have .99 dogs ( at both locations ) with a soft drink purchase . talk about a deal !
1	we go here at least once a month for the tavarua fish tacos with honey-wasabi sauce -- worth the wait , or you can call ahead and pick them up to-go .
1	i ordered their steak and eggs , which was awesome ! i ordered a medium rare steak and despite how delicious it was , it was more on the well done side rather than medium rare . however , everything else was cooked to perfection ! it was odd , however , to have been seated in an area where there were absolutely no other people but with the party of two others i went with . but the service was great nonetheless . i would definitely come back again for their steak and eggs and to maybe even try out the other items on the menu !
0	i went there to get a quote on oakley lens repair and they wanted over $ 200.00 . found them on ebay for $ 20.00 . then went back to have 1 screw put in a different pair of glasses and they wanted $ 20.00 for 1 screw ! ! this place is a rip off . do n't waste your time going .
1	i 've seen a few american airports by now and i have to say that this one is probarly one the nicest and cleanest i 've ever been . nice dining area and great food choices ! staff is very nice and as far as i relember , there are only a few airport who have restroom attendants .
0	went here after all the great reviews . i thought this place was mediocre compared to all the other steak places in vegas food-wise . the venue is very nice and the server are very attentive . i bought a travelzoo gift certificate and got a 3 course meal which included soup , steak and desserts . we also ordered some french fries and mac and cheese . the soup was very good , rich and very tasty . the steak i ordered was medium , but it came back cooked a little bit more than my friend liked . we did let the manager know when he asked us if the food was good and he kind of joked that we ate the whole meal and then complained . the appetizers were ok. the french fries were massive and were a meal in itself . the dessert was also average at best . i think for ambiance the envy steak house is ok but for food people can do better in vegas . .
0	this is the closest grocery store to me , their prices are n't bad , they actually have a really decent wine and liquor section , and i can actually find some of the local az winerie 's bottles on their shelves . the place is huge , they have just about everything , even was able to pick up an hdmi cable when i got my new bluray player and needed one in a pinch . it 's typically pretty clean and well stocked and staff are friendly . the only drawback would be how busy this store can get at times . it can be difficult to find parking without walking half a klick at times , which i do n't mind , but not when i 'm in a hurry . at times i find myself going to the smaller safeway across the street because i know i can get in and out . otherwise not a bad grocery store to live a stones throw ( probably of the rocket propelled variety ) away from
0	this is only for the meatball level . i had been really looking forward to trying this place and left with just a `` meh '' feeling , and one that i do n't expect to experience again . i had gone with some out of town vegetarian friends knowing that their menu was full of veggie-goodness . i was there more for the meat . i started with an italian cream soda in blueberry that had a bit of an odd flavor to it . it might have been the cream , it might have been the syrup , not really sure , but it was just a bit off . then i had the turkey ball with the pesto and the spicy pork with arrabiatta . now , i like spicy things - i am generally a 7 on an asian scale of spicy , but this ball and sauce literally made my nose run . hot , just for the sake of hot , is never appealing . the pesto left a lot to be desired as well . and the turkey ball was dry and rather flavorless . i always buy turkey meatballs at whole foods which are delicious and these did not at all compare . i also order the beans and greens which were good , but super soupy and kind of should have been served with a spoon . the friends that ate the veggie balls said it was really just a white bean ball and rather flavorless . if you are a meatball place , you should make meatballs - the best meatballs ever . these were not nearly as good as my mom 's or whole foods which was disappointing .
1	i love love love this little wine bar . it is tucked away in chandler and it is more than just wine . i went there for new year 's eve and the menu was great . total side note ... whoever compiled the music list for that night did a great job . you never get to hear old school r & b and we were singing the whole night . there were so many different things to try and taste on the menu . the wine is top notch and they go out of their way to help you pick something you 'd like if you are not sure .
1	eat here ! ! try the ahi tuna sandwich . it is melt in your mouth delicious ! the onion rings are super crunchy and flavorful . the use fresh produce that is grown right outside and use locally raised beef and chicken . which is refreshing . other suggestions i have are : fontina burger and the sweet potato fries ( the sweet dipping sauce for these needs to be jarred and sold ! ) , it 's a cool little place with huge personality ... even in the bathroom . they have their condiment and drink station on the outside which is different . if the weather is right , enjoy your meal outside under the giant tree ( it 's actually pretty cool ! ) for me , it 's quite the drive , but it is well worth it .
0	this hotel is not one i would recommend if you were coming with someone you wanted to impress ; rather it is a hotel i would recommend if you were coming out with some buddies and just need crash space . the indoor layout of the casino is labyrinthine and confusing . there is a more-prominent-than-usual smoky smell . the parking is alright when you can find it . however this hotel is on the cool side of the strip-very close to nyny , mgm , and the gameworks/food court area . location is very important when you are in a drunken haze and need to stumble back ! the rooms are once again , fine if you are just in vegas to party or relax , but not of the caliber you would want if you were taking a girl ( or guy ) here with romantic intentions . the beds are fine and well enough to fall on after an exhausting day of drinking and walking and cussing at slot machines . the bathrooms are really nice though , a strange contrast to the room itself . overall i 'd come here again for maybe a quick weekend trip with my bros to club or whatever . special note : they have an arcade with an orange julius in the downstairs section , it 's pretty cool .
0	this is a good distance from the strip , and probably not worth it unless you are really in the mood for chicken - which we were ! the spicy chicken is definitely spicy - lots of flavor in the sauce . service was great , prices were a little high for what you get . great for a quick meal , but probably not worth driving/paying for unless you are in the area for some other reason .
1	i would describe the food here as modern comfort food . i had halibut fish and chips which was delicious . the fish was n't over or undercooked and had just enough crunch . the bf had the jamaican jerk chicken sweet potato , which was amazing . it was a huge sweet potato filled with jamaican jerk chicken and veggies . everything was very flavorful . for dessert we had the chocolate chip calzone . omg , so good ! very filling though , we shared it between 3 people and still could n't eat it all . our waiter was very friendly and attentive . i suggest going here on a very empty stomach .
0	i used to go to the boardroom about a once a week . menu with a great variety of options , from sandwiches to salads and a hot station that typically offers two - three dish options with an abundance of sides and your choice of cornbread or a biscuit . i decided to venture in a few weeks ago and the place was practically empty , not the crowd it used to be . after looking at the hot options , a fish , covered in a red sauce , spaghetti and meatballs , that looked like they were prepared the night before , and some meat , not sure what , i decided i would pass and order a sandwich . it was okay , but overall the staff was n't too friendly and the atmosphere is definitely outdated with a somewhat disorganized seating area . i wish it was as good as i remebered , but probably not somewhere i would return again . sorry ; - (
0	its not bad pho , its just not great pho . when i wrote my first review i was a rookie and did n't have anything to compare it too . now that my pho palate has some notches in its belt i can say that this is n't the real deal . maybe i was here on an off day , but the broth just did n't have that depth and complexity as compared to ben thanh or vietnam grille . thats really about the extent of my review . the ambiance is nice and i 'd say if you are in the area its worth visiting , but other than that , there are other places worth the journey .
1	i always have a good experience going here , and i really like the location . their hot dog / chips / drink for $ 3 is killer if you just want to get some down & dirty gas station food , but they also run great specials on candy and drinks sometimes as well . customer service is always over the moon here ! it seems like these people actually care about what they do , which can be rare nowadays in any industry . also has an oil change station & car wash. woot !
1	i 'm always craving in-n-out . today was different though i was really really craving it . i was surprised when we got out order it was n't correct . we went through the drive-thru . i have never had one of the workers ask if we wanted `` special sauce '' on our burgers it has always been `` spread '' . that was n't a big deal to us we just thought it was funny . my hubby ordered a `` 4x4 '' and i ordered my usual `` grilled cheese '' . we always ask for it with grilled onions and for them to add mustard . well , they repeated the order back to us and said it just how we ordered it so did n't at all expect it to be wrong . we pulled away ( napkins covering the food so could n't see it just yet ) and eagerly pulled into the parking lot across the street to get our grub on . the burgers had grilled onion and raw onion and had no mustard . now we are fans of raw fresh onion but it just was n't how we ordered it and the raw onion covered the taste of the grilled onion . for a moment i thought we might have created a new item for the `` secret menu '' . the fries were black , and i mean blaaaaack . they were mostly nubs instead of regular long fries . i have been eating i & ob for decades and know they are the most consistent food chain out there . i had only one time ever had an issue at a location where the fries were black and i called their 800 # to complain and i have to say i never ever thought a fast food company would go so above and beyond to satisfy a customer . i was very very impressed . sure , i could call and complain about this visit but i 'm not looking for freebies and i know for a fact i will be eating i & ob for many more decades to come as it is just too darn delicious . i instead just talked directly to the manger just so he was aware as i know he knows that preparing the food a i & ob correctly is the standard they want uphold-ed . he was very polite and apologetic . i * heart * i & ob !
0	i heard that this was a christian family run company . turns out the son there is the biggest lying , cheating and thieving crook i 've ever met . the father seems nice and the staff are all fine , but the place is run by the son who is just an awful person . i would avoid the store entirely just because of this man . he 'll rob you blind and spit in your face .
0	the food is ok but the service is terrible ! ! ! ! every single time we come in here it is so so so so slow ! ! ! they really need to work on that ! i see servers standing around talking while there is multiple tables with no food or drinks . slooowwwwww !
1	3 times i have returned , each and every time i leave satisfied ! i am not a sushi eater but here i eat sushi ! its that good . i love how everyone takes pride in the food the serve even the young teen who took our order . he did a fist pump when we said the food was awesome ! he also recommended other dishes for the future which sound delicious but the mango sweet dish will always be my favorite ! !
1	this is my favorite vegan place in town . i ca n't wait till they open at the fashion show mall . love carrot cake cookie sandwich and yes you can get regular meat also .
0	carolina 's is at the corner of cactus and cave creek road with its own parking lot that was easy to navigate and find a spot in . walking inside it became obvious that this place is a local hot spot since it was packed ! to order you go to the cashier at the front counter and pick either individual items or a meal combo . the cashier was helpful in recommending menu items and was nice enough to suggest a combo deal for us that was cheaper than the meal we had pieced together ourselves . i had the # 15 - three flautas with a side of rice and beans with a taco added on ( hard shell ) . my fiancee had the two taco meal with rice and beans . the rice and beans were very tasty , which we have had a hard time finding since our move to the valley . the taco fillings were good ( shredded beef , cheese , lettuce , etc . ) but the taco shell itself was oddly greasy and tough to eat . on his last taco , my fiancee actually just pulled out the filling pieces and ate them without the shell . the place itself was n't the most organized and cleanest , but in their defense we went at dinner time and it was very busy . there were a fair amount of people taking to go orders , which we may do if we venture here again . overall : b- suggestions ? try the soft taco instead of the hard shells and i do n't recommend the flautas since they were a touch burnt and there is way more shell to filling ratio on those - so not quiet as yummy .
0	i know , i know ... it 's heresy to dis wholey 's in pittsburgh .... i ca n't help it , though . the smell when you walk through those doors turns me off immediately . a fish store should not smell like decaying fish ! maybe i 'm spoiled from the time i spent in md and all the truly fresh fish in clean fish stores that do n't stink in a pinch , i 'll pick up what i need , but it 's worth the extra step to hit benkovitz on smallman . benkovitz is clean and smells like a fish store should .... it does n't smell .
1	pizza is awesome , period .
0	harper 's reminds me of a kid who consistently gets `` a 's '' , is n't flashy , never causes any problems , and yet , does n't get the recognition he or she deserves . over the 14 years i 've lived in charlotte , i 've probably been to harper 's 15-20 times - that averages about 1-2 dinners a year . how is that possible ? how have i not chosen this restaurant over others that are n't as consistent , well-priced , and just plain good . i 've never had anything but great food and service at harper 's , and they might just have the best chicken fingers in town . i 'm pleased to say that when my husband and i were deciding where to go on saturday night for a 6pm dinner with our kids and my mom , we picked harper 's . it was delicious . first of all , it 's a beautiful restaurant with servers who are always on top of their game . secondly , it has a huge selection of entrees , wine , and very good kids ' meals . my kids split a cheese pizza ( and , of course , i had to try a piece ) . it was ridiculously good . in fact , it was one of the best pieces of cheese pizza i 've ever had . . . at harper 's . can you believe that ? it was thin crust with a ton of gooey cheese , and not too much marinara sauce . honestly , i could n't believe how good it was . . . but , i 'll move on . i had the chicken fingers with two sides - and i picked mac and cheese and vegetables . insanely good . their chicken fingers are so delicious - i could go on for days about those . . . and the mac and cheese was also some of the best i 've ever had . i love a gooey mac and cheese where the cheese overtakes the macaroni , and this was definitely that kind of mac and cheese . the veggies could have been cooked a little longer , but they were very good . my husband had the veggie burger , and he could n't stop talking about how good it was . my mom had a grilled chicken sandwich , and she also thought it was fantastic . the kids each got a scoop of vanilla ice cream ( comes with the kids meal - bonus ! ) . for dessert , we all split a hot fudge/ice cream/brownie ( with me eating the lion 's portion ) . it was n't the best hot fudge brownie i 've ever had , but i consider myself a dessert connoisseur , and really - can you get a bad one ? it was very good . our wine was great , my husband enjoyed his blue moon beers , and all in all , it was a perfect dinner . side note . . . i do have to admit that i had to get up and run 8 miles the next morning because the food was so good that i could n't leave a morsel on my plate . but it was so worth it - i 'd do it all again ! go to harper 's with or without kids , and you wo n't regret it . it 's a very good meal , reasonably priced , and i bet you 'll walk away thinking : `` hmm . . . that was really good . remind me again why we do n't come here more often ? ''
1	oh so expensive .. .and worth every penny ! four adults with four customized buffalo burgers , a shake , 2 side salads , fries , zucchini and two sodas cost a little over $ 110 . where else can you go to get a delicious buffalo burger ? its not something we do everyday , but we looked forward and planned ahead for this . deliberately with a try ! i would add pictures but the phone died .. .maybe next year i 'll easier for my phone to charge .
0	4 stars for the ambiance , 2 stars for the food . i loved the fact that the games here are free and the place has a cool vibe . i ordered the teriyaki chicken wings . it did n't seem very fresh even though they used a good quality product . the wings were also caked in a very thick , ultra sweet sauce . the drinks are reasonably priced and served cold . the music here is a little bit weird , kinda like stuff they play at pure or the bank . what is really great is that all the games here are free . if i was 10 years old i would probably be peeing in my pants . i mean , i am able to beat the ol school x-men game ! if i tried to do that at a regular arcade , it would probably cost me 20 dollars in quarters ! i might return here for the games and drinks but would n't come back here for the food .
0	i love their dj line up , but i hate how this club was designed . if anyone has been to light nightclub at the mandalay bay , this club looks a lot like it but smaller . their fog machine goes off way too many times and it 's freezing for girls too ! ! i feel like they leave it on for 15 secs long . too much !
1	over easy is a cool new breakfast spot . the location is cool being attached to the ice den . our waiter was happy and helpful . we could not decide on a single meal so we split 2. we enjoyed the wolfpack and the three eggs w/ steak . the wolfpack was delicious and the eggs were delicious . the steak was tough and chewy . we will overlook the steak and will be back frequently . the patio is ideal and the views of the mcdowell mountains are good .
1	this place is my favorite for lunch ! after discovering baiz on yelp i have been back for lunch almost once a week , sometimes more . i usually get the chicken shawarma plate . wish it came with hummus , but it 's available as a side . kabobs are good also , but they take awhile because they are cooked to order . they make their own pita , it 's always fresh . you have to try this place if you have n't before ! great food , friendly staff , and a market full of food you ca n't find in other grocery stores , you can shop while you wait for take out .
0	food = 4 stars service = 2 stars my and the bf were hungry and did n't feel like making the trek out of our hotel so we hit this place up . i have to say that whoever designed the menu totally catered to my flavor profile .... salt and lime . no it 's not very sophisticated , but i love it . i ordered the tortilla soup and a chicken burrito . also we ordered a queso appetizer . the queso was lame honestly ... they meant well , but after like 3 minutes it hardens and is no good . the soup and burrito were soooooo good ! i was a happy camper . my bf ordered the falafel tacos . basically he said that they were n't that great for him , but he understood the concept . if i 'm back to the luxor again i 'll hit this place up .
1	je trouve les prix un peu \u00e9lev\u00e9s , mais je vie encore dans le pass\u00e9 quand le cinema co\u00fbtait 7 $ m\u00eame si on \u00e9tait vendredi soir et que le 3d existait pas . je n'aime pas le fait que certains films soient seulement en avx , ce qui fait qu'un billet te co\u00fbte 3 $ de plus juste parce que le son est suppos\u00e9ment meilleur ( personnellement \u00e7a me passe 10 pieds par dessus la t\u00eate , je veux dire , un film c'est un film , qu'il soit en 3d avx imax ou whatever , il sera pas meilleur et l'histoire changera pas si je paye plus cher , non ? c'est juste moi ? les bancs d-box c'est juste agressant et le 3d c'est encombrant avec les lunettes . moi je veux voir un film , tout simple , sans avoir \u00e0 payer plus cher parce que on me donne plein d'extra dont j'ai pas envie . c'est encore juste moi ? le prix de la boisson et du pop corn lui ? c'est normal que juste \u00e7a \u00e7a co\u00fbte plus cher qu'une poutine \u00e0 la banquise ? ok j'arr\u00eate . ) excluant mes envies meurtri\u00e8res envers l'industrie du cin\u00e9ma , je donne quand m\u00eame 4 \u00e9toiles \u00e0 ce cin\u00e9ma . parce que ts\u00e9 , c'est pas de sa faute \u00e0 lui , si c'est comme \u00e7a que \u00e7a marche , avec le marketing et l'argent et tout . je l'aime bien ce cin\u00e9ma , parce que les salles sont confortables , il offre des films en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais , et il est toujours \u00e0 jour avec les nouveaut\u00e9s , ce qui n'est pas le cas avec le cin\u00e9ma de la banque scotia sur ste-catherine , mon autre r\u00e9f\u00e9rence quand j'ai envie de d\u00e9penser une demie journ\u00e9e de salaire pour regarder une fucking grande tv . ok j'arr\u00eate . le cin\u00e9ma et moi , on est comme un vieux couple . je l'aime quand m\u00eame , vous l'savez ben .
1	the best ribs always . tortilla soup , ribs , and a pacifico . that 's what i have every visit and it 's always awesome . if it 's in , ill eat the peach cobbler because that 's their best dessert imo .
0	with the guys preoccupied with `` guy stuff , '' i was left to roam the strip all by my lonesome . when my tummy notified me that it was lunchtime , i did n't have to search far to find a quick grub spot ; i was standing right in front of an ad for earl of sandwich ! well , that was effortless , thank you universe . my caprese salad & a fountain root beer cost less than $ 9 . i so appreciated the very appropriate portion -- just enough for one moderately hungry girl -- as some portions in vegas tend to err on the side of ree-diculous . the tomatoes & mozzarella were fresh , but the salad was kind of drowning in its vinaigrette . overall , it was un-special & really kind of `` meh '' but i ca n't knock a place that serves $ 5.99 salads & sandwiches . wo n't be a stop on * my * next trip to vegas , but if you 've just lost your shirt at the blackjack table , * you * may want to stop by this wallet-friendly planet hollywood eatery .
0	went here on a thursday night to watch a game . they have $ 5 burger specials on thursdays , which is a pretty good price . they are n't amazing , but hey they are $ 5 and surprisingly filling . a couple of us had california licenses though , and the guy who checked our id 's gave them a lot of trouble . he claimed there were multiple `` suspicious '' things on them even though they are completely legit . we 're not sure if it was just a way to try to get us out of there because it was busy and we were staying a while , or if their policy really is if you have a fake id , you have an hour to get wasted before getting kicked out . it was eventually cleared up , but you 'd think a bar would know how to check licenses . my rating is really because of the whole id fiasco . the food and drinks are pretty well-priced if you 're getting the specials , and i think they have one pretty much every day .
0	i came here a few months ago or so for a brazilian ... the staff were nice , the atmosphere was comforting , and the prices were really good ! however ... i 've gotten waxed at other places several times before , both hard and soft wax , but this time , my hair grew back way faster than all the other times , and some thicker , and seems that not everything was taken off . it also seems like some of the hairs were broken off when pulled , rather than pulled from the roots ... i thought about going back , but i live on the opposite side of town ( 35+ mins ) and did n't have the time or desire to drive back , so sad to say , i went back to shaving a several days to a week later . however , i do plan on coming back to give this place another shot once its closer to spring , because you just cant beat those prices and the staff were really nice and customer service was good , so its worth another shot .
0	since when did amc take over it ? ! what happened to rave ? ! this used to be my absolute favorite theater but now not so much . : (
0	the security guard is quite rude . on a recent trip to phoenix for a conference i sat down on the very edge of the steps outside the arizona republic building for a moment to move something from my heavy bag to my suitcase and was very harshly reprimanded for sitting there and `` blocking employee access '' . i apologized and moved off the steps onto the public sidewalk to finish up what i was doing and once again was very rudely told that i was not allowed to be there and needed to leave . so just be careful not to sit or stand too close to the building !
1	well we will see how far they have come as i have reservations next friday night early as it is valentines day but looking forward to a flawless and wonderful experience - i will let you know post experience
0	i keep having the same problem everytime i go here ... they are always out of everything ! the employees have always been decent with me ( it 's a hit or miss . some are very nice and helpful . some are just rude and treat you like an inconvenience ) but whoever is doing the stocking of that store or maybe it 's at a corporate level needs to start doing a better job . i come here mostly for nyx cosmetics because i ca n't find it anywhere else . everytime they are out of the one powder color i need . i asked the girl when they would be getting more in and she just shrugged . you look around the aisles and most of the products do n't have prices , there are bottles opened and just really messy and worst of all i have to inspect all the things i buy because the majority of them have been used ( like people stick their fingers in them or use the lipsticks ) which is sooooooo unsanitary ! get your act together ulta ! also i went in once back in may to get the opi gel polish put on my nails for a wedding i was leaving out of town for the next day . i called right when they opened that morning and made an appointment for 5pm . i got their 15min prior and was seated . at 5 they went over to the stylist who was to do my nails and told her i was there . i could clearly hear the stylist tell the receptionist that she does n't want to do them , that she just wants to go home . she rolled her eyes , put on a fake smile and came over to talk to me . she then proceeded to tell me that she was over booked and she could n't do it but i could come in the next day . i told her i was leaving for a wedding and could n't do that . she then looked at my nails and made a disgusted face and said she could n't do anything with my nails anyways and offered for me to come in after my trip . it was ridiculous and needless to say i did n't .
0	this is a unique experience , highlighted by the mob themed schtick that starts literally as you enter the door . the food , is better than average and you get a lot of it ! the meatball appetizer is terrific , and everyone was happy with their meals . desert was also top notch with the cannoli . here 's the one rub , and it 's annoying . because we had 8 of us , the 18 % tip is included . that 's fair , but i have to say that our waitress was below par . inattentive , and lacking instincts to determine some basic needs that we had were annoying , but literally having to have other servers find her for us was aggravating . she seemed to lack training and her work ethic was marginal . i still say come for the food and atmosphere , but beware that automatic tipping leads to unmotivated waitresses on occasion .
0	got a comped lunch buffet from the poker room . i had to wait a good 20 minutes and it was around 2pm . yuck ! i could n't find any hot food that looked good enough to eat . i did try some cheesebread that was ok. the desserts , and free soda is all that i had . there was creme brule , and some pudding dishes .. not bad , but not worth paying full pop for this . look before you go . keep in mind everything is lowest possible quality . mgm is cutting corners where ever . if you do n't care about food quality , there was a promo for $ 30 all you can eat , all day long . so you can go to breakfast , lunch and dinner , and chow down until you pass out . nice was to keep people on the property . you 'd have to eat breakfast or lunch and dinner to make it worthwhile . breakfast and lunch combined is about the same price as the deal .
0	sexually harassing valet staff ! ! my night and mandalay was fine and very upscale until i turned my valet ticket into the valet office and had the guy behind the counter ask me if i was a hooker ? ! ! ! and proceeded to ask what i as a woman was doing out so late then ? ! ! ! i am not a hooker . i was wearing my black slacks and flat shoes from my bar tending job at another casino . 2 am is not late when you work till midnight ! the most unprofessional sexist creepy experience i 've ever had in vegas - congrats mandalay ! where do you find such horrible people to represent you ! emailed tosha ( see below ) and discussed with management . we will see .
0	the food here is good . i ca n't complain . but i feel it is a bit overpriced . not my number one choice of chinese restaurants , but i 'll have dim sum or a late night meal if people want to go . if you want good chinese food that is on the higher end of the price range , this is the place for you .
1	bombin cupcakes ! super nice employees . i crave the cupcake with the cookie on top every dang day .
0	this place went from being a half way decent bus station ( lockers , semi-clean restrooms , vending machines , and good security ) to something of a hassle and a nightmare . the new security guard company set up is a joke . the police were here when i arrived , during my stay when i went dt for lunch , and during my departure . wow . not deterring anything . they also do a half a * * job searching bags upon entry , easily missing people coming and going and being less than on top of anything . the station greyhound clerks went from being understaffed to overstaffed and yet they remain unfriendly and the lines are no shorter . all in all , this place is going down hill fast .
1	meal includes a trip to the excellent salad bar . fried flounder , shrimp and scallops do n't disappoint . orion rings are very good . hush puppies are very good .
1	chef rubber has the best customer service . if you ca n't find something , they 'll definitely try and get it for you . tammy is my fave sales person . she truly goes above and beyond with helping me find the right product / sweets / ideas for my sweet boutique . will continue to be a loyal customer .
0	do n't give thanks here . it 's been a while since i 've posted , but for anyone who ca n't remember , see my motto above . and i get even more pissed when it 's expensive bad food ! so imagine my mood when we left quiessence yesterday having dropped $ 171 for 2 , ( including tax & tip ) , on a meal that was certainly worse than what i could make at home . i had the date & beet salad , the turkey entree , and the apple crisp for dessert . served family style were , greens , sausage & onion stuffing , roasted carrots & parsnips , mashed potatoes , and a bread basket . i 'll start from the beginning with the salad which was ok. not what you 'd expect for the price , but acceptable . the turkey was brined in an over salted liquid with something odd added . it was moist , but i still left slices on my plate the flavor was so odd . the stuffing had very little flavor at all & was dry . the sausage added nothing but meat so that the vegetarians could n't eat it . the mashed potatoes were also over salted . the carrots & parsnips were severely undercooked . hard as rocks . or maybe they were overcooked & dehydrated , since a few of them were mush . the greens were good . all of the side dishes were left over . there were 3 kinds of bread in the basket ; a dry foccacia , corn bread , & a soaked , with oil or butter , corn bread . they all seemed like they were from the previous day , & someone had tried to save them . we all had the apple crisp with cranberry ice cream for dessert . it was also ok. the crisp was good , but needed lemon juice to cut the sweetness . the ice cream was an iron chef moment . not a good one . i removed as much as i could & poured a little cream , supplied for the coffee , on my crisp . oh , for some vanilla hagen-dazs ! we were tired of counting pennies , and thought we 'd splurge . we 'd all been to quiessence before , when there was a different chef . it 's a lovely location , but not enough to make up for the food . on the day that i usually give thanks for the bounty of life , i started planning thanksgiving dinner for next year .
1	i love the olive garden . although it cost $ 49.25 ( before tip ) for a party of three on my recent visit on 12/22/10 . if you really believe those awesome breadsticks are free , think again . i recommend the garlic-herb chicken con broccoli and the minestrone soup . the chicken comes on a bed of noodle shells in a creamy white sauce and perfectly seasoned with a touch of garlic along with the broccoli . another favorite during lent is the shrimp primavera which is cooked in a spicy arrabbiata sauce along with penne pasta , bell peppers , onions and mushrooms ( i say hold the mushrooms ) . make sure you ask your server for a couple of extra chocolate mints to wash away that garlic taste in your mouth . did i mention the breadsticks and the minestrone soup are awesome . i can say i have had an excellent meal every time at olive garden whether it 's in the south or the midwest and the scottsdale location delivers the goods as well .
0	if you have a medical fetish ( no fu * * * * * lie ) then you 'll love this place . the people here act very superior to everyone else , like as if they have phd 's in piercings . i had to ask a cupple times to actually get someone 's attention . ended up not getting a piercing here , which good choice , go to htc , people are better , environment is better , and not as crazy prices .
0	meh is right . have been here before ( 2 yrs ago ) and was back tonight . this was a solo visit , eating here early enough ( 8pm on a friday ) before heading off on a flight . let 's do the good first : the service was really good , the ambience the same as i remembered ( it 's a kinda modern vibe ) , and there was nothing actually wrong with the food i had ( salad to start , fish tacos as main , and a few negro modelo 's to wash it down ) . they also bring chips and salsa out as part of the deal - and they 're good ! the bad : the food is ..... ok. my salad suffered from that us tendency the sweeten everything up , so while the core ingredients were top notch , the overall salad was a little too much to handle in terms of its sweetness ( the dressing ) . reluctantly , i could only eat half of it . after which my soft fish tacos arrived . these were the biggest disappointment . why ? flavour ( or should i say , flavor ) . there was none . seriously . i ended up lumping some salsa and drizzling some lime juice from my chips'n'salsa on to the fish tacos to `` brighten them up '' . total bill for this ( 2 beers , starter salad and main tacos ) was $ 49 before tip . so this is the reason i 'm rating this a two star in the review . meh indeed ! at $ 30 all-in it would have been disappointing but kinda ok from value-for-money point of view . at $ 50 plus a $ 10 tip ( service was good , so 20 % seemed appropriate ) it 's a rip . not going again until something changes .
1	it 's wonderful to have a casual , upscale sports bar in the neighborhood . the staff is friendly and accomodating- from the hostesses who offered a genuine smile upon entering and a coupon on the way out ... the bartender who helped me find new ways to drink a flavored vodka ... and the manager who took a table reservation for a busy college bowl game night . i have been three times the past month for drinks and dinner with the family , including one night with my children . i ca n't wait to return to take advantage of the happy hour specials , as well as the fire pit and live music on the patio . thank you dan majerle !
1	i love this place . ! ! ! new owners his name is long and him and his wife are really amazing .. he does the best job ever and never rushes me .. i recommend this place .. great service and his work is the best in vegas
0	this place has drastrically gone down hill over the past few months . the service is crap and i had been somewhat of a regular and when i stopped in last night for what i expected during the usual happy hour , the `` bartender '' told us all they had on special was their house margarita for $ 7 . i looked at her and said , `` um ... what ? the house used to always be $ 5 no matter what and happy hour had all other maragaritas half off and $ 2 wells ... so now , nothing ? '' either she had no clue about her the specials at her own damn bar or they really dropped the ball on their happy hour since that was the only reason people went . no thanks twice now , we have walked in and immediately left to go to bar louie . from now on , i 'll skip san felipes all together .
1	i love the location , i love the vibrant irma wolfe and alexis batista , and the bar scene is an eclectic mix of fun people . the hip and stylish interior really fits the area and the crowd . the food menu is great , for two or for a big group . ordering a few things , seeing what you like that night and then ordering another plate or two . my faves have been the baked brie it is so yummy and comes with a honey and balsamic glaze on top and the mediterranean plate love that hummus ! if you are looking for a new place to try , one that you will surely put on your dining out rotation , this is the place .
0	i spit most of the food out . way overpriced for the quality of food .
0	i dont have many good things to say about this place . we attended a friend 's reception in their upstairs space . they were completely unorginized . the reception was suppose to start at 4pm . however , when we showed up at 4:30 they hadnt started setting up yet , the open bar was n't open , and the bride was understandably stressed out . when republic finally got their stuff together , all the guests that had arrived on time , scrambled to help the bride and groom set up . what should have been an enjoyable celebration turned into a rushed event . the bride and groom had arranged to have their wedding pics displayed on the tvs , but one of the managers was still trying to set it up over halfway through the reception . talk about lack of preperation ! they also told the bride the upstairs space would be available to our party all night , so the entire party had planned on staying and ordering dinner off the menu . however , due to lack of communication , someone double booked the space and we were not only kicked out , but rushed out to accomidate a differant party . the bride was devistated . after seeing what these guys put a bride and groom through for what should be the happiest day of their life , i will never give them my buisness and will continue to spread the word
0	i went in to use the groupon for jamba juice . at first they said i could n't use the groupon for juice , only smoothies . after i corrected them , they charged me .50 for tax . then they said that the groupon was only good for $ 7.00 even though it said $ 12.00 and the girl had me mark it redeemed . horrible customer service and the juice was n't that great either . probably not going back .
0	i have never had any luck flying spirit , but what happened to my brother last night takes the cake . the reason for actually writing a review , i wish i could give zero stars . my brother flew out last night ... las vegas to detroit . he waited to check his bag for 2 hours , because they were letting another flight skip in front of him . he is handicapped , only has one leg . he never uses his handicap , after waiting in line for that long he asked for some assistance or a handicap line . the spirit agent told him there was no handicap line and that he should use the leg he had to get through the line . i will never fly spirit again and i will tell everyone i can about this . spirit airlines , making comments about someones handicap is going too far .
0	if you sit at a table with a dealer named matthew , run far far away . he faintly resembles tom hanks , and is the meanest person in the world . i do n't think i saw him smile once and made my gambling experience the most unpleasant one i 've ever had . send him to a serious table or fire him please . he also made me feel pressured for sitting at his table and told me to go to another table countless number of times . rude rude rude service . i 'm disappointed .
0	filib 's what can i say . if you are craving your basic mexican taco shop this is the place ! i am just excited that one has opened closer to home ! personally i love their burritos , nachos and quesadillas . filib 's is my go to place when i am hungry and need a quick meal . btw i still do not agree with yelp , burritos are a food group , darn it !
1	introduced not even a month ago and i 'm in love . dan t. surprised me with a great brownie sundae from here a few weeks ago . he has raved and raved about it , so i was excited he brought it to me . after digging in i had to share some of it with my mom . the thing was huge ! like split between 3 or 4 people huge . my family and i drive past it atleast twice a week , but never stop . only talk about stopping . after an afternoon lunch at 5 guys this saturday though my parents stopped . what a great dessert after burgers and fries and much better than any diner i have ever been to . my mom and i shared the mocha almond concrete . what 's a concrete ? think blizzard but with more to offer . you know how with blizzards you are usually at the end of them , the bottom of the cup , left with no toppings and just basic ice cream ? well not here at mister d 's , everything was swirled and mixed perfectly . almonds all throughout the little gem . i also love that you can watch the workers though the giant walk up window . they also offer a drive thu . the only thing to beware of here ? brain freezes ! ; ) do n't chow down too quickly . enjoy it !
0	only place in montreal i found that does hwe dup bap and they do it very well too ! could be more generous with the pan chan but overall quite good - we shared a main dish - was enough for lunch !
0	there 's no mexican-asian fusion going on in this restaurant , except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined . it 's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a mexican restaurant or chinese restaurant , so they decide to open both in the same space , with separate kitchens . i love both mexican food and chinese food , but this is neither here nor there . two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot , and inexpensive - this is just the opposite : overpriced and mediocre . we ordered everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both mexican & chinese food : blood orange chile pequin margarita ( $ 15 ) - i liked this margarita a lot . i do n't care for the taste of tequila , and the blood orange seemed to mask this well . it had a spicy kick to it , but not so spicy that it was undrinkable . guacamole & chips ( $ 15 ) - handmade , and delicious , but the price is about double what i would expect to pay for fresh guacamole . chips were light , crispy and fresh . tacos ( about $ 5 each ) - i 'm used to dollar tacos ( maybe $ 2 ) at a taco truck . i got the tinga poblana and it was good , but unless i 'm expensing my meal to work , i would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos . lamb potstickers stuck on you ( $ 12.88 ) - 6 pieces - this was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night . the lamb inside was tasty and i liked the crispy lace ( sweet onions ) design on the dish . would recommend this . sui mai ( $ 13.88 ) - 6 pieces - the only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top . the rest was just okay , and tasted heavy on the ginger . at a normal dim sum restaurant , you can get 4 sui mai 's for $ 4 that taste better . dan dan mian ( $ 12 ) - wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - this was definitely spicy , nothing that blew me away though . at least the price was reasonable for the portion-size . col de bruselas ( $ 12 ) - these are on the acidic side - tasted really limey . i would n't get this again . shrimp mojo ( $ 18 ) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $ 2.25 per piece of shrimp . sauce was good , not too spicy , this was one of the better dishes we had . bistec con mole amarillo y hongos ( $ 20 ) - grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again , with the small portions . it was one of the better tasting dishes we had , but expensive . all in all , it 's an interesting concept and i was there for work so i was able to expense my meal . with tip and tax , it was $ 60 per person - quite honestly , i would rather eat at a mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food . with so many other options in vegas , i 'll be going elsewhere .
0	i 'm not really a huge fan of shabu shabu because i 'm much more used to the concept of hot pot with a soup base rather than ... well , water . there is a sukiyaki option but i 'm not a huge fan of sukiyaki either ! ah yes , you get two options for your shabu shabu . you either get plain hot water or sukiyaki base ... the reason i came here was because my parents wanted to try this place out . my mom saw kobe beef ( or something similar ) on the menu and decided that we absolutely must try this place out . first , the area/plaza that the restaurant is at is quite .. dark . we debated whether or not we wanted to even go in cause the restaurant was fairly small as well . it sits maybe 20ish people . it had about 3-4 four tops and a long table in the middle of the room . in the end , of course we went in . but the place seemed very quaint . was n't noisy and very nicely decorated . throughout the whole night , there was only one server working so service is fairly slow when there was about 4 parties . however , she did her best and she did not seem like a headless chicken . she did n't seem rushed nor was she uncaring . when she was n't as busy , she 'd always check up on our table to see if we needed anything . there is a fairly thick japanese accent to her english but she can speak english well enough . the menu had a good variety of combinations and options from you to choose from . they had jack , queen , and king categories on the menu . jack being the smallest serving and king being the most . they had single meat , meat combos , and mean with shrimp/scallop combos . every combo came with salad , platter of assorted veggies , and unlimited rice . you get three different sauces as well to dip your food in : ponzu , seasame/peanut butter , and a spicy sauce . i actually would 've liked it a lot if they gave me soy sauce with that as well seeing as the only sauce i liked was the spicy one . however , if you ask , they will give ! we eventually asked for regular soy sauce . i ended up getting the kobe platter . their beef was pretty good but the texture/taste seemed kinda funny . my parents said that the beef was really good and had good `` beef flavor '' but it seemed a bit weird to me . maybe it 's because we cooked it in plain water instead of a soup base like i 'm used to . who knows . oh $ 1 edamame on saturdays . and +1 free dessert : scoop of vanilla ice cream with a sauce . you get to choose strawberry , chocolate , or caramel . i 'm not sure if that was only for the day i went or if it 's a daily thing . in the end ... i probably wo n't go back . not my cup of tea . if you like a little bit of flavor to your food , then i would n't really suggest it . shabu shabu had always been quite bland to me but the quality of their ingredients is good .
0	i 'm not a big fan of italian food , but i was craving pasta and pesto and my daughter wanted mac n'cheese . i 'd driven by babbo many times so figured we 'd try it . home run ! the bread they bring to the table was fabulous ! nice start . the staff was very nice and quick . my daughter loved her mac n'cheese and i had a tasty steak and pesto dish . the noodles were a little al dente - and i 'm a mushy pasta girl . the steak was tasty , the pesto was quite good and i had adequate garlic breath when i left ! i will go back to try something else there - their menu was quite large and had some interesting appetizers and dishes . and their wine list looked nice too !
1	why would n't i be a fan of my own known world ? ; ) m & m 's ! ! how could you go wrong with a variety of m & m 's , accessories , etc. ? this tops off the fact that they have 4 floors of goodness . they include a show that you can catch watching for a good few minutes . ca n't complain about the prices , it 's vegas . the only , only , only reason why this is not a 5 star is because ... they need to bring back the crispy m & m 's please ? ! ? ! c'mon , why advertise the orange m & m when you guys do n't even sell crispy m & m 's anymore . sure , pretzel m & m 's are good , but it was my ultimate favorite . i think it was everyone 's favorite .
1	4.5 stars ! ! ! what this place lacks in decor and location it more than makes up for with great vietnamese food and helpful service . i came the 3 miles from my hotel to satisfy my yearning for noodle soup ( after reading about this spot on yelp ) . even though i arrived after it was closing they served me my mi tom cua ( squid , prawn , crabstick and egg noodle ) without complaints . also they let me order a take-out pork sandwich . all for $ 12 . i loved the fragrant tea so much i bought a pound of it too . even though i only wanted 1/2lb i did n't make a fuss as the family was so nice . come here and try the beef pho ( i do n't eat much beef so i skipped it ) as it looks like the best !
0	i 'm going to have to agree with aletheia here . why is this place deserving of such buzz ? i fully expected the interior to look like a dive , but i did n't expect the burger to be the blandest thing i 've ever eaten . there was n't a hint of seasoning on the meat , and all i could taste was onion . even the cheese did n't shine through . i 've eaten a lot of hamburgers - i 'm obsessed - so i can say without hyberbole that this place served up the worst hamburger i 've ever eaten . i ca n't even fathom why this place is popular with working class stiffs - the cheapest burger is around $ 9 . you can get a better burger at dozens of places around the valley for that price .
0	ok , so i am reviewing my bank statement making sure everything is ok and i find a suspicious charge that i am unsure of . thinking it may be this restaurant i call to ask the manager what the charge would come up as under a banking statement , as often the name of the restaurant is not the name of the company doing business as the restaurant in question . so the woman who picks up the phone does not only not want to hand the phone over to the manager/owner , but asks who is calling , i say `` one of your customers , i am just trying to figure out if the charge i have on my bank statement is correct '' and she says all of a sudden he is not present at all . i said i would call back and she asks well `` why are you calling ? do you want to order ? '' i say no i am calling to figure out if a charge is correct , her response ; `` well who is charging you ? what statements are being made ? '' i politely tell her she does n't understand the proper meanings of these words , so i will call back later when the manager/owner is back . she says : `` he wont be back for a few days .... would you like to order ? '' wow . i will never come back here again for not only being treated this way when i am trying to be polite and just talk to the manager , but also for the fact that she wo n't let me talk to the manager , and third for accidentally finding out that this is the type of place where if you need the owner's/manager 's help correcting or verifying a transaction that this is the sort of response you would get . on a side note : the food was ok , i have had better , but since it is literally across the street i would be here every few days .... not anymore .
1	grand openings are always tricky . i expected the service to be either on top of their game or a little messy . unfortunately it was the latter and i 'd give this place another shot in the future to redeem themselves . despite the waitresses being all over the place , they were all very friendly . the food was good . coming from la , expectations are always high , but since i 'm not a picky eater , i try to be unbiased and considering all that , the food wo n't blow your mind but it 's better than decent . food is pricey but that 's anywhere outside of la , especially pittsburgh with the scarcity of korean restaurants . expect your cheapest dish to be $ 10 . ( time never plays a role in my ratings unless the wait is absurd . back in the day , restaurants took about 30 minutes to serve the food and that was standard and people were okay with that . that being said , food here took around 30 minutes . if that 's too long for you , do n't eat here and then complain ) congrats on opening . hope you 'll be a little more organized next time i come !
0	supposedly they went thru a renovation . i think they forgot the south tower . the carpet is straight from the 50s and has n't been updated ( it 's * very * tacky ) . the bed was too hard to sleep on . i wo n't be staying here again .
0	normally great service and pizza . today service was lacking , nothing more frustrating than an unpleasant and bordering on rude server .
0	had a couple of hours to kill before my flight . this place was busy and the wait was about 20 minutes . everyone there was probably on the same flight . ended up getting a table and the restaurant pretty much cleared out . ordered a whiskey and ginger ale to start things off . server offered me a double for $ 2 extra . of course i 'll do a double ! then we ordered our food and a beer . i ordered the popper burger ( has cream cheese and jalapenos and crispy onion strings ) . i ordered the burger to be cooked medium . the burger was super dry . also had a couple of beers to chill on and go with the food before the flight . good food to fill you up and grab a drink or two . burger was n't impressive . beer was good though .
0	first visit . real good chicken sandwich .
1	del frisco 's what a great place to eat . my wife and i went on a trip to vegas in january . so we made reservations to eat at del frisco 's while we were there . because a friend of ours told us it was a must to eat at del frisco 's when you are in vegas . our big night was tuesday jan. 26 , 2010. it was fabulous , what a great meal . for starters we had a salad with the house dressing that was to die for . i ask our waitress liz , if they sold it ? the answer was no . to bad , i would have bought a case ! so after the salad we shared a bone in filet mignon ( mouth watering ) and a lobster tail with an order of the chateau potatoes . every thing was superb . we were treated great from the minute we walked in the front door . out waitress liz was wonderful and all the other staff members . after our meal liz treated us to a viewing of the james bond wine table . that was pretty cool . then a few days after returning home from our vacation we received a thank you card from liz . that is a very nice ending to a great vacation and a wonderful meal . so the next time you visit vegas i would highly recommend that you eat at del frisco 's .
0	we had a pleasant time atmosphere was nice and the server was very attentive . wasnt overly impressed with the food , but did enjoy the beet goat cheese salad and the french onion soup however . all and all i would go back but probably just for apps .
0	went there several weeks ago . gnats all over the toppings . told staff who seemed to care less . `` what am i supposed to do about it . '' messaged facebook page . no response , tried info form on web . did not work . emailed execs . was told that there is an infestation in between the hall of the interior of the building but gnats do n't transmit viruses . was also promised a gift card by hitesh vp of operations for my valuable feedback . that never happened . seems like in reading yelp , this has been going on since at least april of 2013. lackluster response . go try another place because its clear they care less about your health . there are plenty of clean places out there .
0	trader joe 's has some things that are not available elsewhere . however , at this location parking is a nighmare and the store is so crowded that it 's hard to get near a shelf . if you do n't like crowds , this is not the place for you . downtown location is much better , a larger store , more variety , less crowded , better parking .
0	very friendly staff and romantic atmosphere , elegant decoration . and ? that 's pretty much it ! purchased a 3-course dinner for 2 on groupon . aside from the nice staff , environment and service , the food itself did not worth what i paid . ordered seafood soup as a start in addition to the 3 courses came with the groupon . soup tastes ok to be fair . but you ca n't really call it seafood soup if all the seafood flavor were covered by the creaminess and spices - ijust a regular creamy soup with shrimp and mussels in it at most . appetizer : mexilhoes a casa ( mussels ) . not much to comment , neither good nor bad , you ca n't really screw up mussels . entrees : filet mignon de la porto lagos ( steak ) and salmao a bebado ( salmon ) . one word - tasteless . meat was hard to swallow . rice in plate was dry and hard . no comment on the veggies . desert : flan and triple chocolate mousse . i thought you ca n't go wrong with flan , so my only complaint was the flan was very dry on top . the triple chocolate mousse was more of a triple chocolate cake and has nothing to do with mousse . a good mouse cake should melt in your mouth . i noticed this place has lots of good reviews . which i find very interesting . although the groupon voucher did not really give me much choices to choose from ( you can choose 1 appetizer out of 3 choices , 2 entrees out 3 choices and 2 desert out of 3 choices ) , i 'd assume that they would put some good choices for groupon as it 's suppose to attract new customers , not scare them away with tasteless food . if they only offered some bad-taste dishes for groupon customers , then too bad , wrong strategy ! to sum up , good environment , not-so-good food .
1	awesome place ! !
1	this buffet blows all vegas buffets out of the water ! the price and variety of food is a lot better then your typical buffets . i have tried wynn and bellagio and they are nothing compared to studio b buffet . i heard from a couple people that this buffet was spectacular but i never thought that i would drive out of my way from the strip to eat here . but this past weekend as my bf and i were heading back home from vegas we decided to make a detour and grab dinner here . the line was really long but they seat you pretty quickly if you have a small party . some people are quite picky when it comes to buffets , but there 's really something for every one at the studio b buffet . the variety of food is endless , they have sushi , sashimi , crab legs , oysters , crawfish , shrimp , prime rib , turkey , etc . the dessert area was also phenomenal . i especially loved the gelato ! there were about 10 different flavors you can chose from !
1	* i adore european feels hotels in vegas . * i wanted to ride the gondola , but i 'm too cheap to fork my $ 16 for a fake gondola ride . * i wished i got that gelato . : ( .
0	if i could i give no star , i would ! service was really really bad and racist ! food was overpriced and did n't taste good . this is one of the worst restaurant i have been too . stay away !
0	i was excited to check out big earl 's ( be 's ) , and finally convinced two co-workers to have lunch with me . we got to be 's around 2:00pm on a wed , and where was only two other tables occupied . we were greeted promptly and shown to a table we placed our drink orders , and then put in our lunch request . i ordered pulled pork sammie , my friend ordered a brisket sammie . the food arrived and visually was good looking . we all ordered fries on the side , and they were cooked very nicely . biting into the sammie , i was really surprised at the lack of flavor . it seemed more like a movie prop , rather then a bbq sammie . i thought i would doctor it up by adding some sauce which is provided on the table ( regular & spicy ) . the sauce had several problems . first , the consistency was very liquidy and does not have the thickness of traditional bbq sauce . sadly , the taste was also absent , and i was really , really puzzled . i switched it up to the spicy sauce , and found that to have the same consistency . i bit into the sammie and was once again really surprised at the lack of bite , flavor , and anything else you would expect . we ordered the cookie chipwiches dessert to go , and those were good when we had them later . one of my peers said `` i would n't go back there for dry bbq , but i would go there for dessert . '' i think this may be a case of be 's trying to be touristy friendly , and have food that is safe , and not too much flavor ? the place is really cute inside , and they did a great job with the remodel . the staff was nice , and i really want this place to succeed . it is in a great location , and has tons of promise , but something needs to be reworked here . until then , my peers and i will have to pass on be 's , but it is worthy of another shot down the road .
1	i 've been going to you need nails since i moved to phoenix . i have been here for about 5 months . i refuse to even try any other nail salon because i enjoy coming here and they do such a great job on my nails every time . they have such a great choice on color and designs . every nail technician does a wonderful job too , so do n't worry about who you get to do the job . also the pedicures are on point ! i always get the `` spa 2 '' with the wax . i high suggest trying it . so worth it ! !
1	i have n't brought my dogs for an overnight stay but have left them there for a full day of care which is between 10 and 12 hours . the place is great and they do n't have to go outside to take care of business as this place is so modern it is self sustaining . my dogs are always tired when i pick them up . $ 35 for a day ( they discount my second dog ) is totally worth it . tony , lauren and their team are great !
0	i brought my german performance vehicle in to have an oil leak checked out . chris told me that my bi turbo chargers were failing , and were both leaking . he expected them to blow within 6 months . it has been 8 months and 12,000 strong miles ( i horse the vehicle a lot ! ) and my turbo chargers run really good , and boost hard , no issues at all . the oil leak ended up being the banjo fitting to one turbo , and a valve body leak ( diagnosed by two other shops ) . on a second occassion , where i thought they could n't mess up an ac diagnosis , they told me my compressor was not getting voltage and that it was leaking refrigerant . they told me that the whole system must be replaced . i thought this seemed a little off as the refrigerant had good levels . i took it to two other shops , and they both told me the same thing : the compressor is getting fine voltage , is not leaking , and is just inoperable .
0	out of all my life , i 've never hated a practice this much in my life . whenever i call i 'm on hold for 15-25 mins minimum . they call me and tell me my results are positive and then they send me a letter saying my results are negative , so which one is it then ? ? ? ? so i call them waited on hold just for them to tell me `` they dont know and that they have to call me the next day `` . mind you i had my pap smear january 31 and did n't get results for 2.5 weeks , and the only reason i got my results by phone is because i called them 4 times , but those 4 times they told me they 'd call me back , never did . and come to find out my results never came back from the lab . then i get a letter 1 week later saying my results are normal . i go to get my medical records from them to change doctors and wait 40 mins for them to tell me they ca n't get it off the computer because `` they have a new system '' . the staff is absolutely horrid and inappropriate . i only went there once and they have put me through way too much . these people do n't care about their patients at all .

1	i 've been here once before , about a year ago for a going away get together .. they have a pool table , golden tee , & touch screen games . no complaints my first time : ) my second visit was last night/early this morning and my two friends & i were staarving ! we came in & i do n't remember them having more than one golden tee . there was two or three different versions of golden tee & the tv screens are 20 some inches big : o it looks awesome .. we wanted to play but we had to order some food first . we shared the garlic knots & i ordered the philly cheesesteak . the garlic knots were freakin amazing , it came with marinara sauce but there was a good amount of thick garlic sauce that the knots already had on it :9 i think that by itself could make you full . the philly was really good too , lots of steak falling out of my hoagie & the fries were seasoned perfectly . the other two ordered pizzas for each of them & i did n't want to bother asking for a slice because i knew i was n't going to finish my philly . we ended up getting tired & sleepy so we skipped out on the golden tee games & boxed up our food . i know we 're going to be back soon , home plate is a good bar with more than enough food for your appetite & plenty of games to hang out : ) oh ! and the bartender said when the football season starts they 're going to play all of the games , so just a heads up !
0	i really enjoyed my mongolian beef and pork pot stickers , but there was no presentation of pfc mixing sauces . one of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill non franchise is presentation and experience . i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation . reservations : our party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations . at 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . obviously someone dropped the ball here ..... when we requested silverware for the table . our waitress blamed it on the hostess . yes , thehostess should have provided silverware .. however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck . as a patron i could care less who 's fault it is ; just $ @ & & @ in fix it . defiantly took away from my pfc experience . my hot and sour soup is usally served with '' noodley '' things that i drop in the soup . we were n't given any `` noodley `` things . not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc is n't selling food as much as they are selling an experience . this experience is what sets this restaurant apart .
0	quite the adventure . i had bought a living social and gavin did my hair . it came out fine ( cut , color , and blow out ) and since then i have been back three times . the last time i went , i had an appointment and when i walked in , gavin was working on someone else . i waited twenty five minutes before it was my time to get my hair cut and colored . not even a sorry i am running late . two weeks ago i booked with gavin for 9:00. the day before my appointment i got a voicemail asking if i could come at 11:30. when i called back i said i would change my appointment for then . i was then asked if i could make it at 12:00. i said yes . got there today and gavin was not there . first i was told he was out getting supplies , and then after 15 minutes i told frank , the owner , that i was not going to wait anymore and leave . he then told me that gavin was on his way and had gone for therapy . so which is it ? supply store or therapy . in any case , as i was walking out , gavin showed up 20 minutes late . i usually do n't write bad reviews but i just wanted to warn others as this has got to be the most exasperated i have ever been at a hairdresser .
0	this is by far the shittiest customer service i 've ever received . when i inquired about signing up i asked a man from personal training and before he could open his mouth to answer some woman , who i assume was his boss pulled him over and yelled at him about his sales quota ... in front of me ! i was horrified that someone would direct their employees in such a manner especially i 'm front of potential customers and on the floor ! ! ! that broad needs a reality check !
0	not all 24 hour fitness locations are created equal . although the wigwam location is a lot bigger and fancier , the front desk people seemed damn near mentally retarded . one of them did n't know how to scan my id card to save his life . that 's why i 'm sticking to my location at silverado/maryland parkway . this location is pretty good too . i 've been to quite a few 24 hours and they all seem to have their own personality/clientele . this one seems to attract a lot of stripper/ultimate fighter types , of which i 'm neither . nevertheless , this place has a large selection of cardio equipment/weight machines and free weights . there 's also a large room for kickboxing/yoga classes , not to mention a huge basketball court . if they mix in a juice bar , like the balboa location in san diego , the rating would go up . the 24 hour fitness locations here also need to start up the finger scan entry , rather than having to show my id card every time .
0	good fast service , and the food did n't disappointed . i must have come in at the end of a rush because it was a little nasty in there .
0	nice suites in a new wing of mandalay . rooms were great , but casino was not - slow nights , dead floors . i ended up at the luxor most of the time . not much happening at the far end of the strip .
1	good reasonably priced sushi place on the strip . outdoor seating .
0	consider me jaded , but if the goretorium 's goal is to become the adult haunted house in the nation , they 've got a long road ahead . first of all , the place is pretty damn expensive for a 15 minute vegas attraction , definitely moreso than haunted houses in general . they say it is an `` experience '' and that you can take your time to truly enjoy the haunt . that 's bullshit , considering every single set piece actor basically tells you to go ahead after their done with their act . it seems the goretorium wants to attract based on a pedigree of violence . the problem is haunted houses have been springing up all over the country based on the same premise ; most notably chambers of horror in atlanta , ga. if the goretorium came around during the height of roth 's popularity , circa 2005 , this would have been a new experience . instead it 's just another name on the list of `` adult '' haunts . what really disappointed me was that i assumed this would be an amazing experience . everything on vegas is blown to larger-than-life proportion , so i naturally assumed a brand new haunted house in vegas done by a recognized genre director would really set the pace . it did n't . i really do n't want to spoil things , but there are a ton of just lazy special effects and poorly thought-out set pieces . i 'll give a few pretty obvious examples . - in the very beginning of the haunt , there are two elevator shafts they tell you to avoid . two big problems here : the illusion of an actual elevator shaft is easily discernible by wear around the edge of the mirror that is set into the wall . you basically see the border of the trick , so to speak . in addition , there is a light elevated about 10 feet into the shaft . it perfectly reflects 10 feet below the shaft . when trying to trick someone , you draw attention away from the product causing the illusion , not to it . this should be really dark , dark enough for you to casually look and think it is a real elevator shaft you might fall down , - there are two set pieces where a bride gets her armed ripped off and a woman gets her head ripped off . the problem is they just sort of pull and off it goes . there is n't any force behind it . it 's just lazy . on top of that , the bride has a slight mist of water that sprays out from literally the opposite direction she 's standing at . why would i get sprayed from the left from an action that happened to my right ? - there is a fairly cool set piece right afterwards of a zombie attack of the dinner party . there are all these cool gory dinner meals that have maggots on them . the maggots are a light filter above . there is no sense of dimension obviously . - there is what i can only describe as a `` tunnel of guts '' . netherworld and tons of other haunted houses have the same thing , a spinning tunnel that is meant to make you nauseous by creating an optical illusion in the tunnel that messes with your depth perception . in addition , they usually mechanically shake the bridge to make it worse . there is no optical illusion with this that i can tell , just a spinning wall of meat you walk through on a fixed bridge . - there is a reliance on lcd screens for way too many things , from the ticket line to the exit . the act that occurs in the elevator is totally ruined by the all-too-obvious glow of lcds . i can only describe it as that awkward feeling when you see bad cg in a movie . now , on a positive note , the exit is actually pretty cool . i can only describe it as you being birthed to the exit which leads to an overpriced bar and a cool wall of severed baby heads on saws .. frankly the best part was an awesome white t-shirt with a bloody stain around the neck . you can buy that online . if you 're a real horror fanatic like i am , maybe if you have nothing better to do you can see it once just to say you did it . otherwise , save your money .
0	i have been to this wendy 's multiple times solely because of its proximity to my work . the biggest issue i 've had is they are often out of food items ( baked potatoes , spicy nuggets , grilled chicken to name a few i 've encountered ) . but they do not tell you while ordering , so that you can look at the menu and pick out something else . i 'm always told at the window , sometimes after i 've already paid . then i 've had the hassle of needing to be credited money back . today the regular nuggets ( they did n't have the spicy prepared ) and my pulled pork sandwich were cold . thumbs down for this wendy 's !
0	i love the bagels here . they are tasty and always taste fresh . i would eat here for breakfast every weekend if i could ! however , some locations are better than others- they are not always consistent .
0	recently fell in love with italian ice at another chain in the area , decided to see how cj 's compares- cool to see that they offer grab and go options , and also have additional desserts in the form of ice cream sandwiches and customization options like specialized toppings and waffle bowls . black cherry and chocolate ices are solid but i went with my favorite standby , root beer , which always tastes perfect when topped with custard . here , they pack the cup with ice then top it with a tower of custard- a bit too much for my preferences , but good value at under $ 5 for a regular which was three servings for me . i prefer a smaller ratio of custard to my ice , but the custard here ( vanilla ) also had a weird metallic aftertaste that i was n't fond of . not sure if it 's specific to the vanilla , something to do with the ice-and-custard flavors playing off of on another , or perhaps an issue with the machinery , but i 'll be by to try again .
0	i do n't understand why this place is still open . i ordered the endive salad which had nice toppings but the endive was inedible had had no flavor . also the salad was huge and endive was 90 % it . my friend had a chicken penne pasta that i could have easily made better at home and i am not a good cook . the service was overwhelming at first , we were greeted by three different people , then half way through our meal it was nonexistent . we watched a busser service all the tables around us while our server had disappeared . even a man who appeared to be a manager/ owner cleared the empty plates from the diners next to us , offered them dessert and coffee and delivered their dessert . meanwhile , my guest and i seemed to be completely invisible . i assume this is because we both had most of our food still on our plates and no one wanted to ask why we had n't eaten it . still no server around , the busser finally comes and asked if we are finished , we say yes and he takes our mostly full plates without concern if we enjoyed it . i did n't volunteer any info since the service was so bad i would n't go back even if i liked the food . i work in a restaurant so i know the difference between a server who is swamped and a lack of interest .
1	this place is fun ! a friend i work with introduced me to sakana a few months ago and we decided to eat here again on nye , calling it the best last meal of the year . i 've never really cared for ayce sushi places and usually ca n't put away a huge quantity of food in one sitting . so on the rare occasions i go this route i 'm usually depending on the help of my gluttonous dining partners . the nice thing about this menu is anything goes , it includes the rolls , nigiri , sashimi , appetizers , dessert , the entire thing . the only thing separate is the drink . we got the towering sashimi poke , sooo gooooood , we ordered a couple more . also consumed : pork belly , chicken curry , salmon collar thing i forgot what it 's called , green tea panna cotta , red bean ice cream , black sesame blanc manger , green tea ice cream .... the following double order of nigiris : salmon belly with fresh wasabi , super white tuna ( in some awesome sauce i can only imagine is awesomesauce and/or has crack in it ) , and 300 albacore . we ate and ate and ate , it was terrible , it was good . and the sushi chef dragon is a badass . he 's hilarious , fast , and my friend notified him of my mango allergy and he was careful to make sure nothing killed me . when the first towering sashimi poke rolled out , it had mango on it and dragon remembered my allergy , pulled the plate , and got us another , safer , one . this place is literally `` eat all the things ! ''
0	been wanting to try this place and finally did . interesting dishes that certainly are n't common in nc . i would have liked it better were it not for the fact that the food was swimming in olive oil . perhaps this is common for middle eastern food . i do n't know . i tried my best to avoid the puddles of oil and `` dig '' around it , but it is just way too much oil for my taste . if you have gallbladder disease , this would send you to the er . it really was not very spicy either . i certainly prefer indian food 's spiciness . the falafel ( chickpeas , fava beans , cilantro , spices ) had potential but needed to be much hotter . and last the grilled chicken kabob was just . . . chicken . nothing special about it . the garlic potatoes were good ( but my wife 's are better ) . the spinach pie was quite good . the baklava desert was delicious . the staff were friendly and helpful . would have actually given it 2 stars were it not for the fact that maybe all middle eastern food is swimming in olive oil , and maybe i 'm not the best judge of this cuisine .
0	company is a prime example of what is wrong with the american craze with `` tapas-style dining . '' it 's an excuse to halve or even quarter the portion and tack on a few extra dollars to the price tag . those of you who have been to real tapas places in spain know that while the portions are on the smaller side , if you order a few plates you 'll be pretty darn full . stateside , it seems as if the trend veers towards `` single panko-crusted green bean . '' fyi , that 'll be $ 10 . that 's exactly what you get at company : teeny , tiny , uninspired dishes . now , i 'm all for tasting a wide variety of unusual or off-the-beaten-path dishes . if you 've got yams hand raised by blind zen masters in the fertile volcanic soil of mt . who-gives-a-damn , i want to be the first to try them . you wo n't get anything so original at company . just a bunch of run-of-the-mill , generic tapas dishes . you have duck potstickers ? really ? never had those before ! seared ahi ? quel surprise ! service was lackluster , unless surly waiters in blue jeans and silk-screened t-shirts are your thing , in which case consider this your mecca . they even forgot to bring out our last dish until we reminded them a few times that we were still waiting ( and still starving , i might add . ) one star for the delicious cocktails in the lounge adjacent , which are half-off during their unadvertised happy-hour ( no wonder this place is dead ! ) try the sexy clean . take a pass on this one .
0	i honestly am not too impressed with this water park . it costs $ 40 dollars for your basic at the gate entry and the way the park is and the size i would suggest it costing $ 25 for entry . the size of the park is not all that large and while there are a few decent slides to go on . the organization and general flow of the lines is atrocious . i went on a monday just now and a fairly slow day that was n't overly packed . however , the people working the slides had little regard when it came to directing people to the slides . because of this multiple people would all be waiting for one slide while there would be 3 available . instead of getting people out of the way so others could get on a slide . this caused the lines to take an excessive amount of time instead of a quick easy flow that could be easily fixed . also to include that most of the kids working there were not very friendly or personable . they were n't necessarily mean or rude , but more so lacked personality and interest . the lazy river was very generic and lacked detail . it was a very simple concept of a lazy river . my opinion is it could be much better to include some arches of water drips and and some rock walls with some water falls for some variety . oh , and every slide was an inner tube slide . my guess for that is because of how hot it gets here and it is for a reason so people do n't have to sit down on hot plastic . but to not have any adult slides that were just basic water slides was mildly disappointing . i mean the little kiddie play section had normal slides , but unless i missed them completely i did n't see any others . and sometimes those are nice in the heat because you get covered in water completely rather than some splashes from the tube slides . i mean it is a water park afterall . lastly , the final thing i can think of is while i was in the wave pool i grabbed the edge of the pool that had a `` safety bar '' to stretch my arm and i had a whistle blown at me to get off of it . the only reason this really bothered me was that the bars are clearly there as a safety measure . what if someone was struggling and needed to use that to catch their breath in the pool . anyway , overall it was an okay experience for a hot day . i did have some fun and with a few minor improvements i think this could be a much better park to visit on hot days . but for now i 'll try some other places out .
0	ranks poorly against some of the great thai restaurants i have visited . the food lacked flavor and color ( anemic ) , the vegetables were of poor quality and a bbq chicken we ordered was yellow ? pounded too thin and of questionable quality . would have enjoyed a non fried appetizer ? some refreshing spring rolls would have been appreciated . we did order some tasty fried calamari , probably the highlight of this forgettable meal . nothing about this place , including service gave me the impression we would return .
0	stayed in this hotel for a wedding , and there were at least 6 other weddings who were staying at this hotel . which is fine , but the hotel was not equipped with the staff to deal with the volume of check-in . it took forever to check -in and check-out , and even though check-in is n't until 4pm ( which is not abnormal ) , our room was n't ready until 4:30. i think that 's kind of unacceptable when check-out is 11am . the front desk people were not very helpful and never answered the phone when i called from the room . the hotel itself is fine . pretty good value , and close to pitt 's campus . not close to much else , but that 's okay too .
0	i briefly lived in scottsdale for 10 months & knowing that 1 ) i 'll be spending saturday evening with my `` alpha male '' ( reports to work in phx for the national guard once a month ) 2 ) visiting scottsdale again & seeing friends 3 ) going shopping at the new chandler premium outlet .. was good reasons for me to get super-excited . i bid for a 4-star hotel thru priceline & i won for $ 120/night . i was going to spend two nights in this property & pictures look promising : the grounds are beautiful , the hotel facade looks so grand . i was taken to my room by one of the bell dudes who has to cart me away to where it was ... i 've learned the hotel is a sprawling 40-acre property & a pro-baseball team had just left that afternoon . the entire team and entourage apparently stayed there for spring training . then the door was unlocked , 2 beds ..... really ? after informing the snobby receptionist my boyfriend will be joining me the following day , she gives me a 2-bed room ? great . i 've to negotiate for a 1-king bed bedroom & after a slew of flimsy excuses that they 're full ( really ? ... people actually stay here ? ... super-outdated 80s furniture they 're trying to pass up as `` southwestern style '' ... cheap wall paper that 's peeling off in the bathroom , rusty faucet , super-gross carpet ) , i was taken to another wing of what seemed like apartment complexes for a 1-king bedroom ..... my boyfriend who joined me the following day was n't impressed too & we shared the same disappointed feeling . only good thing that pacified him was the nice big hot tub at the main pool area . to me , the only good thing there was the asian ladies who are at the hotel 's main dining area seating guests and serving breakfast . they 're very friendly & eager to please the guests . the breakfast i had sucked tho . denny 's served far better breakfast , i 'm sorry . the fact that priceline even insulted my intelligence by having this hotel as 4-stars really did it , i 'm not coming back . holiday inn express & the residence inn are a lot more comfortable hotels to stay at , i swear !
0	the food is pretty good ... it will definitely satisfy a late night craving for korean food . but it 's way over-priced .... korean food is already expensive ... but i guess it 's because it 's on the strip . i would come again because it 's conveniently located on the strip and it 's open 24 hours .
1	nothing bad to say about this starbucks . typical starbucks inside and out . stopped in early to get a coffee and breakfast sandwich . quite a few people in line , but my drink and sandwich was prepared quickly and came out hot ! enjoyed my breakfast at an outdoor table surfing with their free wifi . nice to find a starbucks close to my hotel .
0	coffee is bad , place smells like burning manure ( cigar shop next door ) . most of the time hipster barista is outside smoking .
0	i 've been here a few times recently sept-oct '12 . going occasionally for trivia on tuesdays . i do n't know if there are just too many people and not enough servers , but the service has been incredibly slow every time i 've gone . different servers each time . even though it is a group of us , they only ask one person if they want anything and dart off before anyone else can order . like i said , every time has been for trivia night , but if i ca n't get service to my table it makes it difficult to want to go back . trivia is fun , but a lot of people on the patio have their ipads out and are cheating the system . ruins the fun for everyone else . tried the wings , were okay , a bit dry and lacking sauce . the good : tuesday has $ 2 mexican bottles , sweet potato fries are really good , i 'll go back for those ! : - ) also a great selection of draft beer .
0	this location used to be a kfc , i went there one day and they were closed . drove by sometime later and saw they were putting a guthrie 's in , never heard of it . i was working in the area and i like to try new places , gives me something to yelp about , so i went to try guthrie 's . think raising cane 's , without the logos , they would be hard to differentiate . chicken fingers , crinkle-cut fries , coleslaw and toast , that 's the menu . actually , they also had pies and salads and the fingers could be on a bun for a sandwich . the differences between guthrie 's and cane 's : the chicken fingers are available fried or grilled . there are more sauce choices than the signature sauce , ranch , buffalo , etc .. the fingers were good ( a little small ) , fries were alright , the toast was excellent , coleslaw ( i do n't like coleslaw , so i 'm not one to judge ) the counter girl was smiling , charming and friendly ( i added a star for that ) . much better customer service than the cane 's at decatur and charleston . the food , since the only comparison is canes , it 's a coin toss , not enough difference to choose one over the other . pick the one that 's closest . ( in vegas that would probably put you at cane 's , since guthrie 's only has one location here ) all in all , i would go there again , if i 'm in the area and in the mood for fingers . that 's the double-edged sword of specialty restaurants , they make one thing , so they should be good at it . ex . in and out , they only make burgers , they are good at it . guthrie 's make chicken fingers , they are good at it . but , if you 're with a group of people in the mood for different things , it does n't work .
1	great service , and knowledge . prices decent . no pressure , wound up buying two guns . recommend !
0	the locations and buildings of the library are beautiful . i love the xeriscape garden at the main library with the peacocks -- which they are also in the process of renovating to make it even more earth friendly by recycling rain water . the programs put on by the library look like a lot of fun , including the culture passes which allow a family to get a free ticket ( monthly ) to different museums and sites that usually cost a hefty amount of money . also , the librarians here are very nice and helpful . on the down side , the hours are strange , and i have noticed that the technology here is very outdated . their catalog computers are ancient , and the website does not function well and seems to be set up in a very old format . i have also searched for more current literature here ( published in the last two years ) and not found much of what i am looking for . i think that the hours and the old technology are both related to lack of funding . i will pay much closer attention to this as a voter , as i believe that literacy is a gateway to higher education , which all people should have access to .
0	why did n't i read yelp before i went here ? ? ? lesson learned . i 'm from texas and shouldve known better , but i used poor judgment and came here with my wife anyways . ive eaten pounds of barbque at all kinds of texas bbq joints and i failed to heed rule # 1 : do n't patronize any bbq place if you can not locate the smoker . this place has none and their sucky bbq and the rest of their food should be avoided at all costs . i thought because this was vegas , maybe they carefully disguised their smoke pit as a fake rock or they rigged it to come out one of those pirate ships at t.i . alas , no . i ordered the chicken fried steak . it was clearly a frozen rectangle patty and tasted like the kind you would find near a convenience store microwave . in fact , i thought i saw a cook run out the back and cross the street to the am/pm and then run back . i do n't remember what my wife had . i do remember her saying it sucked and was overpriced . the waitress was always in a hurry and literally threw our plates of food on our table as she zipped by to attend to other customers . i felt like hitting her in the head with my frozen patty . much like the song of the sirens next door and the t.i . pirate show , the menu lures you in with dreams of gastronomical delights . and just like the show next door , your meal ends with a ship battle going on in your stomach because of the poor food quality . p.s . gilleys : i would n't tout the fact that your menu claims your sausage is imported from elgin . you re making it sound as if elgin is this magical , mystical far away place . its like saying your budweiser is imported from st. louis . so what ? the rest of your food is imported from the generic food aisle of the grocer 's freezer . will never go back there again .
0	went in on a thursday night based on raving yelp reviews ... found out it was `` date night '' including an appetizer , 2 entrees , and a dessert for $ 25 . i 'm not one for cheap meals , but got excited as this was exactly what i had planned to order regardless . so i sat down expecting a good meal . from the start : i was rushed to sit in the back of the restaurant away from other guests ? but ignored this . then we were provided with a newer female server who `` knew nothing about the wines when i asked '' .. interesting . ordered a white zin for $ 6 a glass anyway , seemed decent , until i asked for a second glass . another waiter filled my already half-full glass and charged me for another full glass instead . i explained and asked the manager to price adjust for charging me for something i did not receive -- they mocked me and refused . as far as the food itself , the bruschetta was amazing . the spaghetti w/ marinara and meatballs and gnocchi were mediocre , very small portions ( which is n't awful just fyi- but my grown boyfriend was still hungry after leaving ) , but not awful . i am used to true italian food ( grew up on the east coast where homemade italian food was to die for ) .. this place is a let down . i asked to box my cannoli , but the server insisted she take it to the back and do it herself , and it was thrown by my server upside down and without the powdered sugar , choc chips , etc ... which my boyfriend specifically requested . not that this is much of a request ..... we got the complete opposite when we checked at home . my biggest complaint is the service . i always tip at least 20 % as i have served and bartended for years ... here i honestly could n't leave more than 5 % as i was treated like scum and disrespected . also , i do n't do negative reviews ... but this place needs to step it up on customer service and charge customers for only what they receive . best advice for italian food lovers i can give- eat elsewhere where the owner appreciates good paying customers and values service !
0	i always here great stuff about this place . the food and service totally suck . the tortillas are pretty good and the scenery is great but seriously , a blind homeless guy could cook better . complete rip off , dont believe the hype .
0	i 'm hard to please on buffets , but indus was easily a 3.5 for me . i had a delightful lunch with a few of the boys of boofay recently ( rand h , donald s , and mike c ) who were gracious enough to allow audrey w and i a guest pass . i stuck with more familiar dishes like curry and chicken tikki masala and was not disappointed . i even threw in a salad for good measure . you know , to fill you up so you do n't eat as much ? did n't work unfortunately . everything was fresh and flavorful . our server was sweet as can be ensuring we had plenty of delicious naan available . if i had brought a bigger bag i probably would have stuffed the leftovers into it . maybe that 's why so many women are fond of handbags that really should be on wheels . indus is outside my 5-mile radius , but i would definitely pay it another visit if in the area . i 'm especially curious about their regular menu .
1	highly recommended : fili b 's rocks ! open 24/7 so whenever you 've got the craving that only filiberto 's can fill . my review is rather limited , as i admit that i order the exact same menu item ever single visit . i hear they have other delicious menu items although i 'd never know . i order the carnitas burrito and it is delicious . starting with the fresh tortilla ... it 's perfect . warm , fresh and very tasty ... it only gets better from here . the pork is succulent and perfectly caramelized perfection . they 've added fresh guacamole and pico de gallo that add an additional explosion to your impatiently waiting tastebuds . top this off with their salsa bar and pickled carrots and you 've got one of the best burritos in the valley ! they have 8 valley locations and offer weekday specials .
0	if you 're going to eat at mon ami gabi , make sure you get seated outside ... especially if you go at night . even as las vegas locals , we had a lot of fun sitting outside watching the fountains . they 've also got a really good heating system outside making it comfortable on colder nights . as far as food goes ... it was okay . i had the steak au poivre which came out overcooked for my taste and pretty dang tough . for whatever reason , the brandy peppercorn sauce was all over half my fries and not the steak so i did n't think the flavor was all that great either . my wife ordered the filet bordelaise which blew mine away . her steak was tender and topped with just the right amount of onions and a really tasty red wine sauce . we enjoyed the frites too and they give you a huge portion ! the service was ok but i felt extremely rushed . our waiter seemed annoyed that our table took a bit of time to decide on what to eat and spend some time chatting after dinner . with drinks and tip , our bill was $ 400 which may be small to them but does n't mean we should get subpar service . maybe it was just a bad night but nothing blew me away and i would n't go out of my way to come back .
1	five stars for the kiosk . that 's the only part i 've used . but sending a package at 10pm on a friday ? are you kidding me ? it was super easy and convenient .
0	for 25 years since i 've lived in las vegas i always went to siena deli on trop & eastern for the `` best fresh hot italian sausage '' and finally i get the chance to get over to the fancy new location on west sahara to get out fix . the siena deli is now by far much more organized , lavished and beautiful . however , their sausage is now a whopping $ 7 bucks a pound ( it use to be $ 4-5 per pound ) ........ but no biggie , everything has gone up . i was so excited to taste it , so i get home , my hubby makes his sauce opens up the bag to add the sausage and first thing i notice is the sausage has no color ( hot is usually red from the pepper and spice ) and just by the look we can tell it is not the same quality and not to our surprise the flavor is not the same either . the new product is mediocre , boring , and basically tasteless .... total bummer and a big disappointment . if you step it up & spice it up , we may be back but for 7 bucks a pound it better be made with kurobuta pork . too bad , it is so sad to see that another good ole vegas establishment gone bad . adios to the good ole siena that once was : (
0	expensive and slow service ... you 're better off eating fast food or grab a snack and eat outside if you can wait . even by airport standard this was low !
0	i was impressed the owner contacted me personally . but i still havent returned . i will give them an a for effort in an attempt to get me to return for a better experience ... i just havent wanted to .
0	after dinner at mesa grill we were wandering around caesar 's plotting our next move when we were handed cards for free cover at pure ! sweet ! ! why not check it out ? ! no ga ? you have to be on a guestlist ? yeah , thanks for telling us ( and all the people around us ) before we waited in your `` line '' for 45 minutes . there was n't a famous dj or special event either . line deserves the `` `` because it was super disorganized . that should have been our first clue . look , i was willing to spend $ $ at your establishment , now you 've pissed me off .
0	great food nice people they do n't take american express and i 'll never eat here again . if the owner is too cheap to take american express forcing me to pay another was to my inconvenience than i wo n't patronize them at all
0	i rented a car from enterprise at belmont , nc when i had to put my car in the store . i was referred to enterprise by aaa . the first problem i encountered was not being picked up to complete the rental paperwork . this caused a problem because my wife had recently injured her arm and was able to take me to pick up the car . then the second problem was the fluids had not been checked before the car was released to me . other than that the rental went fine .
0	typical car salesmen . i will not buy from them ever . my wife and i came in with specific models and prices and they did not work with us . they were rude and made us very uncomfortable . disrespectful and a huge waste of time .
0	the room is nice , but the walls are thin and can hear everything in the rooms next to me . plus it does not help that there is a women walking the hallway screaming this hotel sucks . though i suppose that is not the resorts fault . also it could do for some updates to the hotel itself in the lobby , and it is not easy to access . had to walk through a mall type area to get to check in . hopefully the weekend will pan out . not sure i would recommend it to others coming to vegas .
0	rude , rude bouncers , rude people . this place was packed to the gills , you could not walk or hardly breath . no one lets you pass and people push you , this male bouncer actulaly pushed my female friend wtf ! ! ! . there are vip tables in each corner of the club so the dance floor is really compact , there is a techno house room and the other room was playing 70s music , all in all not the best experience . but the music in the main room was good and there were free shot girls walking around earlier in the night ..
0	confused and being starred at by the owner is frustrating . we were hungry so we ate ... plus we kinda felt sorry for the lady ... i just hope i do n't get sick ! the bbq is a great concept but i ca n't find a good one here in vegas . keywords not fresh oily poor customer relations dirty ugly if u do n't mind those descriptions in the place u eat help yourself ...
0	this restaurant is the biggest joke ...... the portion sizes are extremely small and you will leave hungry . after spending $ 200.00 my husband and i had to go somewhere else to get something to eat . a gentlemen in the restroom even commented to my husband that he did n't get much to eat and was still hungry . trust us , go somewhere else . biggest disappointment of our dining experiences .
1	mother india is something different . although at the time i didnt realsise there was a mother india in glasgow , when i was here recently , i knew i had found something a bit special . set aside in a tiny fronted building , inside mother india spans two floors and is a lovely mixture or traditional and more modern concepts when it comes to the decor . it 's actually rather pleasing on the eye , and if i were able to bring a few scatter cushions and a bean bag , i would have a perfect chill out space . anyway ... the food here is something different - its kind of like the bastard love child of spain and india - a selection of tiny portions designed to be eaten tapas style , but from a very indian menu . the concept actually work very well - the food is not only excellent , but by ordering lots of dishes everybody gets a taste of what they fancy without suffering from food envy . there is , depending on what combination of food you order , a overpowering sense of flavour which may be unpleasent to some peoples tastes , however , anything that manages to put a modern spin on indian food is good with me . it also helps that i love tapas . so , `` yay ! i 'm a fan . ''
1	i generally avoid buffets . they 're just not my thing . however , i was seriously craving some indian food for lunch today , and i 'd had this place bookmarked to try . all i can say is that i 'm glad i broke my buffet rule and gave india oven a spin . this place was phenomenal ! ! ! hot food , great quality and stellar service ... all three things i usually find buffet joints lacking in . the garlic naan was probably the best naan i 've ever had . go here . you will not be disappointed .
0	had gone to this restaurant couple a times before and never had received worst service ever ! ! server thought we were from out of town ( which my family was but we are locals ) started arguing with my folks . if they asked for something just like chile sauce , server said he had to put an order for it , what when in a mexican restaurant has an order for sauce have to be put it ; seemed like this server was pissed if we were from out of town ? ? do n't understand why . he was so rude and when we left decided to talk to manager same as rude and we were asked where we were from ? ? did it matter , we as customers should of been treated right , wo n't be going back here again ! !
1	just made my first visit there and i must say i was impressed . it is nice ot know that there is finally a real italian deli out here . i tried the `` pauli walnuts '' sand ' and it was very good with high quality meat . i also had the pleasue of trying some of my friend 's meatball sandwich and that too was excellent ! the only thing i would stay away from here is the `` chicago beef '' , its not like back home . the only real downside to this place is that they are pricey . four sandwiches and a large salad cost 60 bucks ! in their defense i do know that imported high quality cured meats can be very expensive and the taste is great , however i 'd probably be in there at least once a wekk if they were a little less expensive . all in all i think most of you will enjoy the food .
0	not an authentic italian deli at all . i agree with veeder v. 's review entirely . i 'd only add two points 1. they have good feta cheese for good prices . 5 or 6 dollars a pound . copps and woodman 's do n't really have good feta , so we go here for it . 2. you can get a much more impressive butcher case at jenifer market .
1	went here for restaurant week with my sister and we were impressed . first of all , great job with the ambience in this place .... very nice and modern . the drinks were amazing and loved the variety and selection that was available . i had the oysters which were to die for ! omg i could have ate a second plate of those things . i had the shrimp and grits which were seasoned really well and had that extra southern flavor . for dessert we both had the banana creme pie ! words can not explain how tasty that was ! my $ 30 was worth it and i will give e2 a round of applause ! !
1	this place is great for breakfast ! chicken fried steak was perfect , service was prompt and friendly and the prices were reasonable . you ca n't go wrong with the $ 3 bloody mary 's either !
0	this place is okay if you just want the experience , but the food is pretty bad . i ordered the chili cheese fries and they were pretty bad . i only had 1 or 2 tastes and could not finish them . they had no taste and were oily as heck . hamburgers were super dry and huge . the only thing that was good was the hamburger buns and the service . go for the experience , however order minimal food ! i would never go back .
1	the people are really friendly and prices are reasonable . my dog had a fox tail stuck in her paw , and they help me on the things i can try to fix it . this is a great place .
1	my boyfriend and i were in the avondale for the nascar events this weekend and wanted to eat before hitting the road yesterday . i found this place on yelp and we decided to give it a try . we were both very happy with our decision . i had a fried shrimp po'boy with red beans & rice and he had the jambalaya . the shrimp in the po'boy had a light batter and was very fresh and the dressing had a nice flavor to it . the bread was toasted and perfect . the jambalaya had both chicken and sausage ( huge chunks ) and a distinct smoky flavor . he said he was getting it from the rice , i felt it may have been more from the sausage or the chicken . either way , very good . we will definitely return the next time we are in town and plan to take friends and family as well . it was a great family run restaurant and we wish them a happy 5 year anniversary on november 18th !
1	this place gets really busy even on a thursday night . the line was out the door . we decided to do the to-go route , and seat outside so the kids can run around . it was my sister 's b-day , which got a free meal ( $ 12.00 value . ) anything off the menu . bbq ribs were tender and tasty . hot link sausage must have ! chicken breast - save money and order more ribs ! cheesy potatoes - yum ! turkey jalapeno sausage - not recommended - save your money and order more hot links sausages . unlimited sauces ! ! ! !
0	so i go into home depot regularly although when you walk in the door they give you the token hello it 's still hard to find somebody if you have questions to help you i was just in today to purchase barbecue covers there were three staff members in the barbecue section chatting and it was n't until i went up and interrupted their conversation and asked my question that one of them be grudgingly left the conversation to help me . then he finished his comments with if it does n't fit you can bring it back but you have to have a receipt and it must be in 90 days come on everybody knows you can return anything you want to home depot whenever you want he was just an ass
1	we loved our dinner here . super fun decor and feel , not like your in india eating street food , but rustic and different . loads of bollywood posters around . they served the food differently then traditional indian food is served , but it was fun . we loved the food ! it was india-modern-hip-street food ! i doubt many of the things their served you could actually get as street food in india haha it was more in a fusion gourmet level . the only bummer was the portion size ... its like tapas indian style , which is fine and is fun to get lots of different things , but it was a bit more expensive than we thought it should be for the portion size . everything was great ! just do n't waste your money or calories on the chips .. their just chips .. even though i ordered the masala ones they just came with seasoning ... order something else more exciting and yummy ! = ) we will be back again for a lunch = )
0	food was decent but nothing special , big portions . everyone in my party of 10 had the same thoughts . someone put it perfectly when they said `` it was alright '' . expected something more juicy for a $ 50 ribeye . doubtful i would be returning .
0	disappointed . got there at 8 so i would n't have a long wait . they opened 20 minutes late and i only went there for a cannoli and cheese cake and they did n't even have any .
0	shocked that the boyfriend wanted to give the place four stars , as i was totally set on two stars . but he really loved his carvery sandwich . a group of 10 of us had reservations and were really looking forward to todd english pub . the good : the `` 7-second pint challenge '' was lots of fun and meant free beers for some guys in the group . the boyfriend loved his sandwich from the carvery menu ( pastrami ) and the pickled veggies that came with . big menu with lots to choose from . the bad : corn dog bites that tasted a lot like the samples at costco . the ugly : terrible service - from pushing alcohol sales too hard , to not detailing the beers in a flight of beers , to serving the wrong drinks ( beer when it was supposed to be cider ) , to not serving drinks at all and not bringing condiments when requested . our server was completely indifferent to us , but more than happy to put an auto gratuity of 20 % on the bill . the fish n chips which was supposed to be a signature dish was terrible . two of us ordered it and it was gummy and the breading was too thick and undercooked . the location is great , and in general , i really enjoy todd english 's restaurants , but this one just was n't what we were hoping for .
1	we go here quite often - love the tacos . the service has been a little off a few times , but they try . it 's a lively place with a good happy hour crowd - can get real busy and pretty noisy . a cold pacifico in an iced mug with salted rim and 2 shrimp tacos -heaven ! !
0	if i could use one word to sum up my dining experience last night at wedgwood , it would be : underwhelmed . i 'd been wanting to try it out for a long time as i 'd heard good things . although i tried to go in without any expectations , i was just severely underwhelmed . the food was ok. i had the scallops to start , which was tasty , but at \u00a312.95 , i was hoping for more than 2 scallops cut in half to make 4 morsels .. same could be said about the minute portion of langostine which arrived on our dining companion 's plate . d had pigeon which was good , although overpowered by the haggis it was served with . i had the rabbit wrapped in pancetta and have to agree with grace that it was delicious , although slightly over salted . d had the deer which i found to be a total let down . the meat was n't very flavourful , lacking the gaminess which i enjoy about deer meat . again it was overpowered by the haggis that it came with . our dining companion had lamb and verdict was that although the meat was good , the flavours did n't work when you put all the components together . dessert was sticky toffee pudding & chocolate brownie which were ok , but nothing special . out of the two times we had a server come to pour our wine , they only filled 3 glasses out of 4 each time . although i ca n't say the service was bad , i was hoping for something a little more than the minimal . having gone downstairs to use the bathroom , i 'm very glad we were seated upstairs . if you 're booking , definitely request a table upstairs ! although nothing about the evening was terrible , for the price point , i very much feel like i 've gotten much better value elsewhere .
0	i was not that impressed with it . the beef and broccoli tasted weird . i dodident think i got my money 's worth , and i wont be back.i expected more for $ 11.00 .
0	i 'm not a coffe drinker ... their hot chocolate is ok. the environment is very laid back .
0	decent food , mediocre service . we were in town for spring training , and while adam and i are pretty open to trying new places , my aunt and uncle are less inclined . so we found somewhere ( thanks , yelpers ) that seemed to have a pretty solid selection of mexican food . and that 's what we found . the food is in no way mind-blowing , but it 's different enough that you do n't find everything on the menu at a standard chain mexican place . our drinks were tasty , and they have a pretty wide selection of cocktails and beer to keep the crowd happy . the ambiance is nice - even though it was pretty crowded , we were seated fairly quickly on the patio , and we did n't have to shout to have a conversation . our service , though , was pretty mediocre , and we had to flag down our waiter several times because he would not regularly check on us . overall , if we 're back in scottsdale next year , i 'll probably venture somewhere new .
1	i agree with most other reviewers ... they are pretty darn fast for lunch rush in drive thru , never had a mistake on my order and the people are nice in drive thru . good for them at serving people the right way .
0	this is weird but .... despite the fact that we ate a lot , and pretty much enjoyed what we ate .... i ca n't recall a single thing . mac and cheese with added shrimp was cool ..... so was the cerviche .... but nothing at burned itself into my memory . nothing extraordinary , nothing to rave about and nothing to go back to . it was n't awesome and it did n't suck . it was just ... alright . ( as an aside , however i really liked the parking system at the cosmo , the little light system that shows you were vacant spots are . as a casino its pretty cool if out of my budget . )
0	forget the line up this place has gone down hill and the owners do not care .. the cost of spice is up and thus they have cut back sooo much that the taste is gone . the qulity of the beef is now tough . told the owners and they just do n't care .. as long as the line ups are long the taste will keep getting poorer . wow i have been coming here for over 40 years and i have watched the food get poorer and poorer , now it is not even average any more
0	the appeal of this place is their name . when you 're coming off from a long flight and have some time to kill during your layover , you know that this place is gon na serve alcohol . unfortunately , since i was traveling on army orders to a class , and would have to take a physical fitness test in a few days , i had to hold back from the liquor . it was crowded in there , but the bartender greeted us immediately and invited us to sit there . had it not been so close to the walkway/entrance , we might have taken him up on the offer since it was right in front of the tv that was playing the basketball game . luckily , we found a table more toward the inside of the restaurant so we could get some personal space . my buddy and i both ordered the enchiladas . i was ok with the plastic utensils , but when the food tasted like cafeteria style quality , i felt it was way overpriced , even considering it being in an airport . the black beans and rice were just ok. next time , i 'll just come here for the drinks when i want to get smashed for my next flight .
1	duck hash , oatmeal and coffee were all good . not a bad place for some nice brunch .
0	they charged me the drink i sent back , not cool
1	this place is hilarious - the most mongolian thing about it are the two ( count 'em , two ) large , framed posters of mongolian persons with hawks on their arms . oh yeah , that and the terrible - in a good way - mongolian puns on the menu , such as a cocktail selection that will help you `` khan-trol your thirst . '' other than that , this is a basic build-your-own-grill plate joint , except they have a large selection of asian-flavored and mexican sauces , and the grillers are situated behind a large gong that guests may hit at their pleasure . and you can make it healthy ( or not ) as you wish . the one complaint i would have is that it is a tad overpriced .
1	this place has great food ! we 've tried the pulled pork and beef brisket sandwich with sweet potato fried and wedge fries and lemon cake for dessert . they play r & b music and there are plenty of soul food choices to choose from . the service however was slow , but overall , the place had a friendly atmosphere .
1	i had a very special project in mind for an engagement ring . doug was able to design what i had in mind on a computer and conceptualize it with a 3d printer ! great quality with a very fair price ! the perfect ring was made .
0	as usual , the collard greens were hit or miss . and this time was another `` miss '' . waaayyy too peppery ! also as usual , the side dishes for one of the guests in my party did n't come out until after three requests for them ... and probably 15 minutes after chicken & waffles came out . the waffles were underdone . finally , as usual , the service was spotty .
0	so my boyfriend and i were here this last sunday and were really wanting to try this place for breakfast . after waiting 25 minutes in line , we get to the register to place our order and the lady tells us it 's going to be another 25 minutes for our food to come out . whatttt ? ? 50 minutes for a crepe ? no thanks jean phillipe 's . the least you could have done was to give your customers a wait time in advance . unfortunately , we just left and did n't get to try their crepes so i ca n't tell you how they tasted but as far as customer service goes , this place is a thumbs down .
0	i do not like wells fargo banks ! i am not writing about this branch specifically , i am writing about every one i have been in within the last year or so . i have a business account here that has myself and my 2 other business partners on it . the only interaction i ever really need to have is depositing rent checks- that 's it . it should be so simple , but for some reason it never is ! whether i drive up or walk in , it is by far the longest deposit process of any bank i have ever been to . for reals , it takes me about 5-7 minutes ( yes i have timed it ) once i am at the teller window . so today , i walk in and hand over my check and my slip . after a looooong pause ( and way more typing than i believe is required to process my deposit ) she asks me to confirm my home address , not the business address on the account . i do it , realizing later that i just confirmed some marketing departments opportunity to flood me with crap mail . then she asks me to confirm my name ... yes my name . i do it . she then asks me to sign the check right below where i have clearly written `` for deposit only '' and the account number . i do it . looooooooong pause ........ more typing . `` you 're all set , have a great day , sorry i stole 7 minutes of your life '' ( i added that last part ) . wells fargo , i am not your fan ! peace out !
1	dilly 's deli is a frequent stop for us when we 're close to asu . the dilly club is a great sandwich especially when you add avocado . you can choose from a bunch of different breads and they also have wraps and salads . the soups set dilly 's apart from other sandwich shops . i prefer the wisconsin cheese while the wife loves her cream of broccoli . friendly staff and it 's very clean .
1	i do n't have kids , but i kind of love this store . there are just so many fun and funky things for children from newborns to pre-teens in here . i was in there the other day and i almost bought a beatles yellow submarine shirt for my nephew . it was so awesome ! it looked like an vintage concert tee but the design was actually a reproduction of the album cover , i believe . and it was really soft . but then , like fellow yelper su-shien c , i woke up and realized that i was about to spend forty bucks on a t-shirt for a 2 year old . so , i did n't buy it . but now i find myself thinking about it and i want to go back and get it . it would be so cute to see him walking around in that cool shirt ! maybe for his birthday . i think he would probably rather have a toy but i know his parents would love the shirt as much as i did . so , in summary , garage is not the store you want to take your kids back to school shopping by any means but it is a great place to buy a special splurge present for your favorite hipster couple who have recently become parents .
0	we stopped in for a quick bite before a concert at the mandalay bay beach on a saturday night . i had eaten here before when they first opened , i remembered it was average but we were willing to give it another try . there was a mariachi band playing and a football game on the tv at the same time , we could n't hear ourselves think . the hostess seemed like we were bothering her when she realized we wanted a seat . staff seemed a bit disoriented . our waitress was great though , attentive and pleasant , i believe her name was jessica . they serve free chips and salsa , chips needed salt , the salsas ' were gross . we decided to split a steak burrito with cheese sauce ... it was so bland . no spice at all , not much flavor going on . it was edible , but should only be served in an old age home . ( no offense to the elderly ) oh and my husband ordered a dos equis draft , it was flat . we will never go back .
0	well , after some more explaining , i was finally granted my exchange . i ca n't really blame target but this copywriter law must be very hard to control . i just do n't get how one company is ultra strict and another almost seems to mock the same rule and then there 's those that are in the middle . ok , fine , be strict but when a customer takes the time to explain and has a valid reason ... at least hear them out .
1	i miss going to this americas taco shop in my old neighbor hood . glad to see they have more locations now ! ! love their carne asada and their salsa . yum !
0	all hype but the pizza at 2am is amazing tho lol secret tip . call ahead if your ordering a pie . it takes 20 mins if you wait
1	absolutely incredible experience . pricey for sure , but considering this is one of those once in a lifetime experiences , i felt it was definitely worth the money . this tour is especially recommended for those short on time . it takes only 40 minutes for the helicopter to reach the canyon , but to get their by car or bus would take 3 hours . they offer multiple flights per day and if you are willing to wake up early for an early departure , you can easily fit this into a vegas trip with no effect on your other vegas plans . we reserved our seats a week in advance on the grand celebration tour . the day before we got a call informing us , to our very pleasant surprise , that we were being upgraded to the grand celebration tour w/ the vegas strip runby ! ! on the day of our tour , our driver was already waiting for us as we made our way down from our hotel room ( mind you we came down 10 minutes before departure time , so i wonder how long before he arrived ) . very professional and friendly . riding in a limo to the airfield was definitely a nice touch . for both my wife and i , it was a first-time experience . after arriving , our driver showed us the way to the check-in terminal where we were greeted by the staff , who were also all very professional . after waiting for around 15 minutes and watching a safety video , we were shuttled to the helicopter pads where we got to meet our pilots . the pilots are definitely a real highlight of the experience as ours was very well informed of all the sights on the way to the canyon . he was quick to point out all the interesting things to see . the real gem of the trip was the canyon itself of course . once you arrive , the pilot takes you through the canyon so you can get some great aerial views above and inside the canyon . flying through the ridges is something you 'll want to experience . landing down onto the canyon floor is definitely one of the most unique experiences , only to be bested by watching our pilot expertly take off and maneuver through the hilly terrain of the canyon floor . the trip includes lunch at the bottom . the ciabatta bread turkey sandwich was alright , nothing too special . however , lunch includes complementary champagne ! ! where else can you have a toast while at the bottom of one of the world 's most spectacular canyons ?
0	i have been here a few times . while i do enjoy it for a few select items , i ca n't give it a higher rating . let me start by saying i really like their hummus , baba ganoosh , and dolmades . my favorite main dish by far is the philly steak pita . i have n't had the chicken version , but if it is done the same way it 's probably good . i also have a friend who loves the mediterranean roasted chicken . i have had no problems with service , and the place is always clean and bright . also , baby-friendly . i have an under-one year old and there is plenty of room to park a stroller if you bring one . this is a big plus for me . on the down side , i have not liked any pita i 've had other than the philly steak pita so far . the falafel was sandpaper-dry , the mediterranean tuna was also very dry and mostly tasteless though it was a very large serving . the gyro ... you guessed it ... also very dry ! i 'm not sure what they 're doing to their food to make it all so dry , but i wish they 'd stop . their iced chai also tasted like milk , which was very disappointing since i love chai . i will continue to go back because their starters are very good , and i know there is at least one regular item that i like . i 'll have to try the chicken dishes soon .
0	went to this place with my family for lunch and this place was n't as good as i remembered when i went here the first time . the hispanic hostess with her hair tied back in a ponytail was pretty rude when i requested to move to another table because it was cold where we were sitting . she could tone down the attitude , it 's not like i was asking for something so difficult . the waiter was okay , but not very talkative and just took our order without seeming very hospitable . i ordered the route 80 burger and it was basically just a step better than a bbq burger you can get for much cheaper at carl 's junior . $ 16 for a burger with burnt , super salty bacon with a dry party is definitely not worth it . i ordered my burger medium well and it was not cooked that way . i would have requested a new burger , but judging by the attitude of some workers , i 'd rather not risk then doing something weird to my food . the skinny fries are basically just regular fries that have been reheated . do yourself a favor and save your $ 5 or order the onion rings instead . on the bright side , if you manage to finish the whole burger , you should be full for a while . i would not recommend coming here if you have a burger craving . check out guy fieri 's burger bar or go to holstein 's for amazing burgers and shakes . save your money for those places !
1	awesome bbq . upset they did n't have some of the beer listed on menu after attempting to order the third beer . regardless , the food was fantastic & we will be coming back for more .
0	extremely laid back ( a.k.a . slowww and steady ) service , cute waitresses though , and yummy crispy margherita pizzas . we also ordered the spinach artichoke dip which was swimming in grease , but i ate it anyway . surprise ! good for a quick bite .
0	cute spot which was one of the very few restaurants that was open early on a rainy weekend ! i got their huge mug of hot chocolate , as well as the croissant . my boo got the omelet which came with some pate . food was good , everything was decorated in a nice way !
0	okay first off let me start off with this we stay here for memorial day weekend friday through monday this is the worst place i ever stayed in my 23 years of life friday we wait four hours for them to bring the remote for ac mind you it 's 92 degrees in this damn room they finally brought the remote about five hours later second you can hear everything that goes on in that hotel the front desk is like a mile away from building 23 and we order pizza from the pizza place and the alexis park resort they told us 45 minutes took hour 45 minutes and the pizza was it was cold housekeeping has a schedule and if you need towels around 8pm or 9pm you 're not going to get them because housekeeping is going home for the day that 's sucks so sunday we leave to go shopping enjoy our day we come back to our room the door would n't open come to find out they check us out our room on their own we have to wait 30 minutes from them to recheck us back in our room monday morning we 're leaving at 6 am and as were going back to make sure everything out our room a guy in room 2305 is pleasuring himself in the front room window can we call security , security never came so with this all being said i would never ever stay at the alexis park resort ever again
0	my husband and i bought a plum tree and rose bush this past weekend and spent over an hour picking them out . we paid for them and set them up for will call so our landscaper could come with me to pick up in his truck . we showed up the following monday and first they could n't find the paper work then they could n't find the plants . one of the sales people told me to go find my plants with him since no one knew where they were . we found them outside in full sun dry as a bone . he then told me to go ahead and take them with no offer to help or water them before we left . the process took a half hour and the attitude was so what . they also never gave me my copy of the receipt back . plant world may be slightly more costly but the service is 100 % better and they treat customers with respect . my landscaper told me that he has had problems picking up plants before at star . they lost a customer .
1	hushpuppies ? are n't those shoes for the elder crowd ? brunswick stew ? is n't that a soup served up in a canadian province ? smoking while dining ? oh yeah , this is a tobacco state . listen , i 'm just a guy from san francisco , you know , the land of foie gras , locally grown organically produce , the slow cooking movement , i did n't really know a lick about southern cooking ... until last night . sure , it was all fried and oozy and a week on the treadmill still wo n't burn off the number of calories from just a single serving of sweet tea , but now i understand why charlotte is ranked 34 out of 45 on the american fitness index , a ranking of the 50 most populous cities that determined the least fit cities . fried , fried and fried goodness sums up the local goodies available at the penguin , such as the salty fried pickles , a huge batch of perfectly battered slices served with msg laden ranch dressing . hushpuppies , while a crowd pleaser , were a little lost on me , although i 'm sure the same can be said about california politics to those from this part of the country . i also indulged in a wonderfully battered corn dog and a southern burger , slathered with coleslaw . my biggest impression was not the interesting mix of clientele , very typical of some of the districts of san francisco , but the prices . at these rates , we would have ordered the entire menu for what an entree costs at a typical resto back home . as one of my dining partners said , if you become homeless , this is the place to be .
0	went here for breakfast . the food is ok , but the service was terrible . granted , i do n't speak much french , but i think that should n't completely change the attitude of the waiter . anyway , the entire time , we had to ask for refills of water and coffee . basic functions . it was n't even that packed . to top it off , the waiter took 20 minutes to get my check . i asked several times and he told me to wait . when i complained to the manager , he finally got my check , and claimed that i had only been waiting for 5 minutes . the manager sided with him and basically called me a liar . lol what ? yeah , i 'm not going here next time i visit .
0	i 've stayed here before and liked its out-of-the-way location . my experience with the resort fee , though , will prevent my return . i do n't like paying for extras i 'll not use . in my mind , the fee is exorbitant . i will not return .
1	i visited al-hana for the first time today for an unofficial yelp event with rand h. , robyn n. , mike c. , jackie c. and the other jon h. i enjoyed some great hummus and pita bread plus my main course of lamb kafta for $ 8.99 and a can of soda for $ .099 ; this meal set me back $ 10.75 today . prior to arriving , i perused some reviews and the menu . pro tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned . i did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant . there was decent parking at about 11:10 when i got there . as i 'm writing this review 4 hours later , i can tell you that i 'm still stuffed . i really enjoyed my food along with conversations with my awesome lunch companions . thanks to rand for `` inviting '' me . i probably would have not tried this place otherwise .
0	hate to review after only one visit , i will be going back again to give it a second chance . this location , like many of their others , have many many tvs , busy atmosphere , and happy people . first off , i ordered a well whiskey and coke , which was n't bad , but after that was finished i was asked if i wanted another . i agreed and when it arrived it was a glass nearly twice the size of the first . this would have been awesome had it been the same liquor/soda ratio , but this next drink was nearly all coke ... ordered the grilled tenders with honey bbq sauce and a side salad instead of fries . the salad and tenders came at the same time . ca n't say that i 'd order their side salad again . the chicken was served without the bbq sauce and without utensils to eat the food with . my friend and i sat there for probably 10 minutes before we caught the waitress again to get silverware and the sauce for the chicken . the server was very friendly but i paid for the food and service , in which both were unfortunately lacking .
0	this was supposed to be my first time here heard about the place from mt family and `` tge best of las vegas '' . we got the drinks fast but when we were ready to order the waiter was no where to be found . i hate to walk out of a restaurant but the service was horrible never coming back !
1	i need to go to this place more often . they have a big selection and almost always have the item i 'm looking for . the prices are not much different than a big box store but not having to fight the saturday home depot crowd is well worth it ! friendly and helpful staff . i am a fan of ace hardware .
1	oh my word , thank you scottsdale . heaven in a slice of meat & potatah ! yes , i said `` potatah ! '' yumm . freakin ' yumm ... good 'ol meat and potatoes .
1	have you ever thought of opening up a cider house in your living room ? if you have , these people actually made it a reality ! having read all the fab reviews of this place , and also having an affinity for all things cider ( and perhaps alcoholic ) , i had to try it out for myself ! you walk in and it 's a rustic feel , with dark wood everywhere . the 8 daily offerings advertised on a chalkboard are just asking to be sampled . they vary from bone dry to sweet and everywhere in between . the bone dry pear tasted a lot like champagne and the concord grape tasted like sparkling grape juice . i was a big fan of their popular archibold 's amber , that they 're now serving in around 8 local restaurants ( winghart 's , fat heads , kaya and a slew of others ) . the real winner of the day was the off dry alfred 's pear ... in sorbet form ! alcoholic cider sorbet ! ! ! ! can you tell how excited i am ( let me include a couple more exclamation points ) ! ! ! ! so good ! we also ended up with a growler full of the alfred 's pear for about $ 15 to enjoy at home . the owners are incredibly friendly and informative on the different ciders they offer . they receive all their cider/apples from soergel 's in north hills . i , for one , was very excited , being a big fan of soergel 's in general . i 'm very happy to hear they 're just growing and growing and hopefully will be around for a long time to enjoy a successful business and for me to enjoy their delicious cider !
1	they make really great pad thai noodles here . i love that they use the small noodles instead of the big flat ones . = )
0	holy crap this place was packed and nasty .. air circulation was horrible .. felt so gross after came out this place . once again , need to deal with the whole vegas exclusive theme . be there early or have connection or have lots of cash ! ! ! ! i did not enjoy this place a bit . not sure will ever come back .
0	this restaurant changed format about 4 weeks ago , according to the staff , and i have to say that the changes are an utter failure for me ... used to be a relatively healthy buffet with great build-your-own salad variety along with soups , comfort foods , and desserts . most of the key ingredients are still there , but they 've changed to an a la carte system that requires you to tote around a hotel-key style card to register your purchases as you go . i had the salad bar , which includes a few basic soup choices . their better soups are now `` premium '' upgrades that are not included in the salad bar price like they used to be . the chicken noodle soup was especially disappointing , as they used to have a very tasty made-from-scratch soup with thick noodles and good-sized chunks of meat . the new chicken noodle soup tasted alright , but not nearly the quality of what they served before . i would also note that the chicken noodle soup looked / tasted suspiciously like progresso . salad dressing was a huge letdown , as well . i poured the house ranch dressing on my salad and ate my soup . when finished with the soup , i turned back to my salad to discover that the dressing had completely settled at the bottom of the salad bowl leaving a thin watery residue across the top of my salad - are they actually watering down their dressing now ? the basic salad bar includes a bowl of frozen yogurt , but devoid of all the toppings choices ( nuts , sprinkles , hot fudge , caramel , etc ) that they used to offer . the drink tender asked me how i was doing and i said , `` fine . how are you ? '' he said , `` well , been dealing with some complaints lately . '' i told him i could see why and that i did n't really care for the new format . he suggested just piling the salad bowl as high as you can and making do - since you only get one trip through the salad line now , he seemed to assume that my disappointment was limited to the loss of making return trips for salad . even the staff seems a bit weary of dealing with customer confusion and dissatisfaction since the changes . upon leaving , i found that the prices are about 20 % higher than before and they automatically add a 7.5 % gratuity to your bill unless you object to it at the register ( a small note on the register screen flashes that notice as you checkout - blink and you 'll miss it ) . i noticed that they 've removed quite a few tables to create more space in the restaurant and yet there were more open tables there than i 'd ever seen before - an indicator that their clientele is expressing disapproval also ? overall , the food is still good qualty ( which is why i still rated it 2 stars ) , but i think that they 've gone cheapskate in a few key areas while raising prices , most notably in reducing the add-in options when building your salads , downgrading the chicken noodle soup , charging extra for most of their soups , skimping on the dressings ( maybe watering them down too ? ) , and going away from a buffet and more towards a cafeteria style experience . needless to say , the changes are pretty dramatic and i do n't think a single one of them was implemented with the goal of improving the diner 's experience . i reckon the new format will increase the restaurant 's profit margin quite a bit in the short-term but will wind up driving away many loyal diners once they 've experienced the new format once or twice . i and the other members of my party all expressed that we do n't think that we 'll come back after sensing the downgrades . if you 've never eaten here before , you may like the new style . if you have eaten here before , i can pretty much guarantee that you wo n't like the changes that they 've made .
1	awesome shop . laid back and friendly atmosphere . owner joe is a super guy and building a great business . while i am only a visitor to the area , i will make it a point to go back to this shop . i have been to 3-4 other cigar shops in the greater phoenix area , and , to me , this stands far above the rest . highly recommended .
1	they have every possible equipment you could possibly need to work out . the only downfall to this gym is that its so crowded so if you have a workout routine its hard to follow it because you always need to wait for equipment to free up . it is a lot less busy later in the night around 9-10 but if you dont mind the crowd and waiting for machines to free up this gym is excellent !
1	on wednesday my boyfriend and i were walking around in the ph miracle mile shops and were handed a card for college night here-open bar until 1 am with college id , $ 5 for girls/ $ 10 for guys . we figured it would be a good place to pre game and then we would figure out somewhere to go after , maybe gallery upstairs . we were surprised to find that the inside of the bar was much more club-y than bar-y . started with classic rock which was kind of fun and expected considering the vibe of the place , but by 11 it had switched to loud top-40 once the college crowd started to fill up the place . the floor was packed with drunk college students dancing like crazy ... we left around 1 when the thought of another vodka-red bull seemed like a really bad idea ! i ca n't think of anywhere cheaper in vegas to drink/party/pregame if you have guys in tow , although i did feel bad for the poor fools who bothered to pay for bottle service here , honestly even for non-college students it was $ 20 for guys for cover + open bar until 1 ... that said , if you 're a group of girls you can probably find better open bar options early in the night in vegas .
1	roaring fork has a great happy hour . i really liked the huckleberry margarita . i did try the `` big ass burger '' because so many people have told me that i have to try it . i actually was n't impressed . i would probably come back with friends for happy hour but i do n't think i would take visiting guests here for dinner . the restaurant is really nice and seems cozy .
0	less than 10 minutes after our daughter 's wedding ceremony , the best man came running from the banquet hall to the church saying there was `` somewhat of an emergency . '' the bartender needed ice ! the father of the bride , in a full tuxedo and an outside temperature exceeding 100 degrees , had to leave his daughter 's wedding to go buy 150 pounds of ice ( it was in the contract that they would bring 150 lbs of ice ! ) . as i entered the banquet hall , i saw the bartender alongside my brother-in-law , who had traveled to arizona from boston to be at his niece 's wedding . i asked him why he was inside the bar , serving drinks , and he said the bartender needed help . soon enough , we convinced the caterer to share their staff and cut my family loose to enjoy the wedding . what a fiasco ! we paid nearly $ 650 ( i sent the check in february , and it expired because they did n't cash it until june ) to have a bartender serve drinks for 6 hours to 150 people , and bring along some soft drinks and water . we supplied all the booze . there were actually 170 people . did 20 extra people make it that much harder to serve cold drinks ? two days later , i sent a disgruntled email to eric kelchlin , ( the owner ? ) and he called me back , saying that the wedding ceremony had ended 40 minutes early and that made it difficult to be ready for the reception . i certainly had n't been looking at my watch through my tears that hour of the day , but i do n't see how it is possible that we were 40 minutes early ! we had arranged for the bartender to be there at 3:30 pm , and the wedding was from 4:00-4:30 pm . my husband said that he saw the bartender arriving with a small amount of ice , as he and my daughter were entering the church to go down the aisle . apparently , the bartender was late , or he would have had an hour to chill drinks . at best , the wedding ended only 15 minutes early . the night before the wedding , i called mr. kelchlin and spoke with him because i was concerned that the drinks would not be cold fast enough , and to tell him that this wedding was full of partiers ! he assured me that they would get the drinks cold fast . they did n't bring any tubs or coolers , and used the ones on the premises instead . i understood that they were going to take care of this for us . mr. kelchlin also told me that we had an incredible amount of alcohol , more than he 's ever seen for 170 guests . we had 10 cases each of 4 kinds of beer , 70 bottles of champagne , and 20 cases of wine ( 3 varieties ) , and we did have a lot left over . i do n't understand how that mattered , when they just had to chill a few kinds continuously to serve the event . after my emailed complaint and our phone conversation , i received this email response from mr. kelchlin : `` hi karen , again i 'm sorry you are not satisfied with rahul 's service . i try very hard to make sure everyone 's events run smoothly and unfortunately this may not have been the case with your event . '' he also offered $ 25 compensation for the ice , which i declined . in rahul 's defense , i asked him for a glass of pinot grigio and he said he did n't have any . i said , `` i am the mother of the bride , and i bought it ! it 's right there , '' and i pointed to the unopened case of wine . from that point on , he remembered me and i did n't even have to ask for it . he poured it quickly with a smile and a nod . i liked him ! other than his apparent tardiness , we were happy with rahul 's service -- he was friendly and worked fast . perhaps mr. kelchlin did n't tell rahul i had been concerned about having lots of cold drinks ready at 4:30 !
1	quelle belle d\u00e9couverte ! j'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u00e0 plusieurs reprises le camion grumman lors de festivals l'\u00e9t\u00e9 , sans y porter grande attention . des tacos ? boff ... jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une de mes amies me sugg\u00e8re d'aller passer la soir\u00e9e au grumman sur de courcelle . en voyant les photos sur internet je ne savais pas trop \u00e0 quoi m'attendre , mais quelle surprise , wow ! on entre dans un endroit chaleureux au d\u00e9cor \u00e9clectique . le restaurant est plut\u00f4t grand . le personnel est attentionn\u00e9 et accueillant . notre serveuse \u00e9tait hyper sympathique et a pris le temps de nous parler du menu ( qui change chaque semaine , d'ailleurs ) ! tout avais \u00e9videmment l'air d\u00e9licieux , mais la description du menu est incomparable \u00e0 ce que les plats \u00e9taient vraiment . les tacos `` r\u00e9invent\u00e9s `` sont faits d'ingr\u00e9dients frais et sont tout \u00e0 fait surprenants . nous avons pris plusieurs plats et les avons partag\u00e9s ; j'ai ador\u00e9 tout ce que nous avons command\u00e9 . seul point n\u00e9gatif : impossible d'avoir ma propre facture , tous les plats et les boissons consomm\u00e9s par les clients \u00e0 la table sont additionn\u00e9s sur la m\u00eame facture . un peu `` plate `` de devoir tout d\u00e9m\u00ealer \u00e7a en sortant , surtout pour les plus gros groupes . j ' y suis all\u00e9e durant l'hiver , mais j'ai bien h\u00e2te d ' y retourner l'\u00e9t\u00e9 !
1	i love this place and the quality of work they do for jewelry repair . i have taken several silver/rose gold/quartz pieces to be repaired and they always come back perfect ! the staff is charming , and the pieces they create are exquisite !
1	ok , let 's get focused for a second . the grilled octopus . think of all the swear words you know , including all the manky ones you 've learned in other languages ... this is exactly what was going through my head when i ate this . i 'm a big fan of grilled octopus so i 'm quite discriminating when it comes to eating it . served with red onions , capers , drizzled with olive oil and peppered with oregano , this dish was so far off the fucking scale delicious , i was ready to punch fellow diners at other tables in the neck and rip the flat screen off the wall . tender and supple , the octopus was swimming in sex .
0	this place keeps getting worse every time i visit . for starter 's , their slices are overpriced , as are the entire pizzas . secondly , i find the sauce too sweet . the empanadas are ok , nothing to write home about . finally , every time i 've been here , the service has been bizarre . it seems like the staff is high . they are n't necessarily rude , just clueless . also , they like to change the rules on their `` deals '' , which i personally find annoying . also , they often have buddies hanging out which makes the cramped space even smaller . the only reason i go here occasionally is because it 's near my building .
0	we have been here several times and love the atmosphere and how clean it is , the kids also love the arcade . we have recently discovered that they offer $ 1 games on sundays so it is all the more reason to go get our bowl on . although i am still a fan of the old school bowling alleys this place is n't too bad ; )
0	huhot was good , it was n't amazing . the concept was exciting at first of creating your own stir fry . i went straight to the suggested recipe cards and picked out the peanut chicken ingredients . the bowls you put your stir fry ingredients in were not appealing in any way . they looked like cheap , plastic , semi dirty bowls . the freeze dried meat did not impress , not even once it has been cooked . however , my dining experience was fun and i would consider going there again .
1	why did it close ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
1	great steak ! well seasoned and really tender . natasha was our server , took great care of us . would recommend this place any time .
1	one of the best patios in downtown phoenix . love the atmosphere ! the salads and pizza are all amazing ! it 's my go to spot for lunch or a nice dinner . romantic yet casual , this is one of my favorite spots !
0	sugar factory , i had such high hopes for you ! and you let me down ... and i 'm a sugar addict ! do n't get me wrong , like others have stated sf has wonderful desserts . there are a variety of baked goods , candies , ice creams , and other sugary goodness , but the food in the cafe was ok at best . we ordered the macaroni and cheese pops ( the only tasty item i had all night besides dessert ) . they were amazing ! the sauce is off the chain ! ( do people even say that anymore ? ) definitely order these . you will not be disappointed . i also started off with a lollipop passion goblet cocktail . it was overpriced and full of ice ( and dried ice ) ! it was $ 36 and i did n't even get a buzz ( weak ) ! they have a variety of different goblets available , with a hefty price tag and no pay off , i was reluctant to order another cocktail . for dinner i ordered the french dip which was tasteless and bland . pretty much the worst french dip i 've ever had . my best friend had their sliders , which were okay . nothing special . my mom had a pasta , which i tried and we both agreed it was flavorless . my sister ordered the bbq pizza which was pretty dang good , but not mind blowing . we were all pretty disappointed with our over priced food and under performing beverages . we ordered dessert , we got the cookie jar sundae . it had every type of cookie on it , plus ice cream , and lots of fresh whipped cream . it was delightful . and definitely meant to be shared . this ended the meal on a nice note . the service was excellent . the restaurant was clean . the entire staff was awesome . no complaints here on that end . i had such high hopes for this place ! i really did , but it 's a more expensive , less tasty version of the cheesecake factory . as for people saying this place is fancy , give me a break . there were all walks of life here . the girls and guys going to the club , the grandmas , the europeans with their fanny packs , and every other class and creed . stop in and get dessert and then bounce . there is a candy shop , a bar , and a chocolate lounge in this same space as well . sorry sugar factory , you just are n't that sweet .
0	it was time to euthanize my dog of 13 years . i have never done this before . i watched a video which showed the process peaceful melanie lowernce dmv came to my home i signed papers , she charged $ 350.00 . she gave my dog a sedative . after 10 minutes she stated it was time . she went to the right arm which was weak . she shaved her arm tried 4 times fishing for a vein . unsuccessful . tried the next arm after 3 tries asked he associate to try , 3 more times , then they tried the back leg , i do n't remember how many time . i said i can call a pediatric nic nurse to start the iv , i guarantee they will get a vein the first stick , i was answered no it was against the law for someone else to start an iv . so she went in the juglar vein after 2 attempts my dog had a hemotoma the size of a half dollar on her neck i stated enough . then the vet , she said i got it . not realizing that she got positive blood return from the hematoma ( blood clot in her neck ) she had to have went thru the jugular vein on one of the sticks to have her start bleeding under the skin . then she gave the medication to euthanize her . this was horrible , and heart wrenching , my dog suffered another 10 minutes , coughing , choking , nodding her head multiple times kicking , twisting her head . tears coming from her eyes . this the vet said was normal . i realized i do n't think she did get the jugular vein , she got positive blood return from the large hematoma . i believe my dog suffered and died from the suffocation from the leakage from the jugular vein and the pressure choked her to death . thats why it took so long . i do n't recommend this vet or her associate to euthanize any pet . prisoners die more humanly .
1	stopped in here for lunch and got the cucumber sunomo , yellowtail jalapeno and the tuna special . all were very delicious and fresh , for being a monday . these are off the modern sashimi section , so no bed of rice . each had a little spice and crunch which complimented each other well . the meal did not come with wasabi and ginger , so we needed to request that . after trying one with the typical mix , i now know why they were n't served with our meal . they were better without . if in the area of crystals , give them a try , it wo n't disappoint .
0	the rooms gives me the creeps .. all the damn statues . we got there late and all the double beds were supposedly taken so they gave us an upgrade to a suite ! awesome right ? thought the room was quite spacious with bar and living room and one big king size bed but it was just so dark ! i think i turned every light but it was so dim probably because all the black in the decor . in addition there was so many egyptian type pics and statues that just look at you ... it 's so disturbing . definitely a step up from excalibur but i would n't stay here again either .
1	if there is a better cake supply company in phoenix , i have n't found it . as an amateur cake artist the knowledge and experience of the staff is a huge help . when i tell them what i 'm trying to accomplish they give great tips and show me which products are my best options . they 'll also let you sample the food products before you buy . they also have a schedule of classes that changes monthly for helping to improve your cake decorating skills . if you 're not careful you can spend a lot . so take your list with you and try to stick to it .
0	must say that the entrees are extremely cheap and generous portions . expect to pay $ 6 to $ 7 . they have a bar available to pick out your sauces and peppers , it 's a nice touch . i ordered the chicken burrito complete meal which includes beans and rice . it was ok but the biggest minus is that they did n't flavor the chicken meat which is unbelievable ! no wonder they need the sauce bar to give some flavor .
0	this rating is on their new self checkout . i have been a shopper and avid costco enthusiast since it 's days as price club . i love the place ! but ... recently my costco put in self check which is ridiculous ! it takes you longer to scan each item . longer to wait in the self check line and longer to get through the door audit ! i have tried it several times because i thought maybe it was my fault but after doing everything right - it is still inconvenient and slow .
1	stopped by for a couple slices for lunch today . they have a $ 4.99 combo for 2 slices of cheese and a drink , $ 5.99 2 slices of peperoni and a drink , and $ 6.99 for 2 slices of combo and a drink . today the combo had mushroom , sausage , and pepperoni . i had a drink with me so i asked if i could get the combo without the drink . the cashier gave me $ 1 off . the pizza could have been heated another minute longer , but it was still good . they recently started a ayce for $ 6.99 , which includes pizza , salad , and pasta . i will probably come back for that when i am on a mission to get my fatty mcfatfat on ! ! the staff was friendly and we even had a conversation about various ayce sushi spots around town !
0	las vegas is like spring break . except all of the people are adults and more pathetic . i was hungover , walking on the strip in 2005 when a hooker asked what i was getting into . i told her i was feeling sick and stay away . she did n't listen . i puked and it almost landed on her shoes . that is the perfect metaphor for las vegas . a prostitute ducking vomit .
0	they were okay . i would n't say they were great . they were very nice and offered us bottles of water since it was so warm in there . ceiling fans , but no ac ? really ? they were quite busy and as i was getting a pedicure a lady walked in who apparently made an appointment and they had no time to accommodate her . they asked her to come back tomorrow , she said that she could n't and that 's why she had made an appointment for this date/time . i felt bad for her , they accepted two walk ins before she showed up . if you know you have upcoming appointments , you should state that and ask the walk ins to come back or wait . not the other way around . also , the quality of my pedi was n't that great . guess i 'll keep looking . cheap ? yes . worth it ? meh ! i did n't think so .
0	food was n't all that great , the cheese on nachos was disgusting ! kind of cheese that the taste stays with you for days . but the beer kept coming quick and drinks were very good . we had some fish tacos , nothing special there , guppy on a tortilla with slaw . nice to be outside area .
0	good lunch - got the black bean burger on whole grain roll , with sweet potato fries . the fries were absolutely awesome , and the `` burger '' was good - a little too spicy for my taste , but good nonetheless . great , friendly service . would definitely go again .
0	i guess osaka used to a quiet nice japanese restaurant with real japanese food . now its just horrible and .... i am quiet sure i wo n't go there again after tried them 3 times . my friends thought it was just lunch , but dinner is the same poor quality . its definitely for people who like korean sushi ... i bet their rolls are probably 800 -1200 calories . cant be a skinny bitch if i eat these kind of japanese food all the time .. hehe
0	its like waikele outlet for all you local hawaii people . except the bebe there has merchandise on sale for stuff that is regular priced at ala moana . + you can smoke hookah while the ladies are shopping . just find the hookah guy . + armani had a $ 20 sale when we were there in february !
0	since we have two houses across the street we are working on i applied for a credit card to get 5 off with purchases . after seven inquiries on my credit they said they could n't verify my identity and declined the account . called this store since this is where we do most of our business . explained to the associate what the problem was and asked to speak with a manager . was told he was busy , i asked for a call back . never called , either never got the message or too busy . at any rate this is not how you earn my business . lowes contracts the credit card out to some other company so that is not totally their fault , however no call from the manager ( 2 requests ) is on them ... one star . by the way seven hard inquires on your credit lowers your fico score and takes a while to fall off . just a heads up ....
1	i am going to start off this review by saying i may be a little biased , but in my opinion sassi is the best restaurant in phoenix ! the reason i am biased is my husband and i got married here 2 years ago after falling in love with this place and then getting engaged here . with all that said , even if this place was n't so magical ( because of everything it means to me ) i would still love it . we had dinner here this past saturday and , as usual , the food was amazing . we the roman meatballs , like usual , and they were fabulous . we both had pasta dishes after that and again , so good . finally to dessert , sassi has n't always had the best dessert selections , but this time we went the menu changed a bit . it was overall paired down to some great selections , but the biggest change was the desserts . we had the peach cake with cinnamon gelato , and i must say , it was fabulous ! i just love sassi and would recommend it to anyone for a nice romantic dinner out and a taste of true italy !
1	i have been in the service industries for twenty five years , i 've worked at the best bars in las vegas and i know the difference between good service and someone making me feel like i 'm part of there family.not only do i love the food there , but on my last stop the waitress emeli made me feel like i was part of there family.it was refreshing to get that kind of service it really made me and my girlfriends night.great food and always great service.thank you hot and juicy ....
1	breakfast , lunch and dinner are served here . each of these meals are healthy , clean , and tasty . the prices are not cheap but definitely worth it .
0	thanks to the dps ( or maybe the arizona department of revenue , snicker snicker ) , this and every other freeway in town sucks . every two miles it 's the same routine : drive by a speed camera , but not before you slam on your brakes because everybody acts like it 's the first time they 've ever seen it . misery . it still gets two stars because it 's close to my house .
1	i have been to the union grill at least five times . i always enjoy the food and the service is good . it 's definitely a hidden gem in oakland .
1	i 'm new in town , noticed this place out on tropicana , then saw the yelp reviews and decided to try it . i love the atmosphere , love that the walls pay homage to the rat pack , love the very square yet cool lounge act performing in the restaurant . the host and waiters treat customers like vips , reminding me of vegas when i came here 25 years ago . nice wine list too . and they serve food until 5am ! the biggest surprise was the food ! i ordered spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad . i do n't know what they do differently , but that caesar salad was amazing . really , really great ! i 'm pretty sure i tasted more parmesan than i usually do , but there were some other seasonings in there too subtle for me to identify . fantastic ! the single serving of spaghetti and meatballs was enough to feed a family of four , unnecessarily large . but despite that , and i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , this was truly the best spaghetti and meatballs i 've ever tasted in my life ! and i 've had some of the best . i used to live i ny & nj and i 've travelled all over italy . i certainly never expected i 'd one day say the best spaghetti and meatballs i ever tasted was in las vegas . i wish i could afford to eat here often . that 's the downside , it 's just too expensive for me . but for a special occasion , or if you 're rich , i totally recommend this place .
0	wanted to reiterate a day after consuming three pints of the hop , drop while at home : you do n't want to drink more than two pints in one sitting , as three has the great potential to knock you on your rear . this is not a session brew with a low abv . good thing i was home and having some drinks with friends , and did not leave the house . if you are out having this , unless you are the size of an nfl lineman , i would not recommend having more than one pint and driving .
1	really tasty , but even more overpriced and nothing here is exquisite . the space is nice and the service is good . but $ 64 for 2 glasses of wine , a salad , a sandwich and 2 cups of coffee for lunch is a little ridiculous . my rule of thumb here is that i only go to chelsea 's kitchen when it 's not my money .
0	my friend and i wanted to try this place out after seeing a sign in front of the building stating $ 15 manicures . so we thought we give it a shot . we walked in and were greeted by the receptionist and by a man who looked to be the owner . when we walked in were we asked if we had seen the sign in front and if that is what brought us in . we said yes and then we were told a person will be ready for us in 12 minutes and we could pick out our polish in the meantime . the section of polish was very limited only essie polish in about 20 colors . i was under the impression that we would both be seen at the same time but my friend was first while i had to wait . she had gel nails that needed to be taken off so she told the manicurist about them and if it was a problem he seemed unfriendly and then said it was fine . her manicure lasted about 30 minutes and well she was getting them done the manicurist started to open up and talk to us . he started to talk about the clientele in a rude way and making fun of the people in the neighborhood . he even asked if we grew up around this area and we both stated yes but that did n't stop his rude comments . after about an hour we were finally done and went to pay . the receptionist told us it would be $ 20 each , my friend brought up the sign saying $ 15 and she said that is only for members . but no where on the sign did it state that . we should not have paid the $ 20 but we did . the manicure was definitely not worth the money .
0	it 's been several years since i 've been here and i see the name has changed from blue sage to stone grill . along with that change came a change to the breakfast buffet , and not for the better . the price is the same , but the selection has dropped dramatically . i was also disappointed with the service . the place was empty and we saw our server twice while we were there . doubt i will go back again . it 's a shame because it used to be so good .
0	this hotel is just mediocre . nothing special about it . besides the fact that it 's across from saks . rooms are very clean . beautiful views . long check out and check in lines .
1	shanghai angus steak rock !
1	we have been here for breakfast on many occasions and have never had a bad meal . recently we tried the all you can eat friday fish fry and it is wonderful . the clam chowder is excellent .
0	yeah , it 's cheap , but it 's the worst buffet in las vegas . i came here , years ago , but i see that nothing has changed much . from what i remember , the fish was rubbery ( it 's always iffy with seafood at buffets unless you go to the rio ) and the selection seemed big , but when the food is not good , why bother ?
0	over priced . service not so great . did n't inform us they were out of uni and toro before ordering many dishes and appetizers .... on the other hand , the sushi chef was very cool and very pleasant .
1	lol , lmfao , rofl ! `` fuh , kim , long .... '' - `` fuhkimlong '' ..... ok , so it was funny for me for the first few times i said it ..... the pho here is pretty darn close to what i had in vietnam , i mean it is just broth , noodles , and beef ... but here you can tell their broth sits in kettles like they do at pho 999s in hcmc . they do n't give you as much beef as they do in viet nam , but it 's still really really good . ca n't say much for service , but food a+ . here at pho kim long ( ^ , ^ he he he ) it 's almost a mixture of vietnamese , chinese and thai with their dishes which makes it better than just a pho house . another plus is they 're open 24 hours , which is probably why they 're broth is so good . so if you got a hankerin for some soup that 's not heavy , but will fill your belly , come here to pho kim long ii and enjoy a bowl of pho , hot and sour or wonton soup .
1	went last nite . great atmosphere and food outstanding . mac and cheese . hubby had smoked tuna fish sandwich and loved it . also enjoyed flight of local beers ! ca n't wait to go back !
1	cory was my energy auditor and jeff was my service rep , and both were extremely friendly , knowledgable , and time efficient . there was no sales pressure , and i was comfortable scheduling some work to be done through them . unfortunately , through unforeseen financial circumstances , i had to cancel the work . and , i have to give them credit for not pushing me to reschedule , not being upset , and being very customer satisfaction oriented . this seems to be a very professional company , and i will go back to them once i am ready to resume any work to be done .
0	i ate here with the family while on vacation in vegas . it was my first visit to a brazilian style steakhouse and none of us thought very much of it . like others , we went in because of the coupons they were handing out all over the place and thought it might be fun for our teenage kids . service was marginal , took way too long to get drinks . salad bar is nothing special . of the meats , the sirlon was the only thing that tasted decent - not great , but decent . the other meats were not that good . without the coupon , this place would be significantly overpriced for dinner . wish i had read the reviews before we visited , this is not a spot we would go back to again .
0	stayed here for a week .... and surprisingly room service sucks ! other than that , the rooms are beautiful and the people are friendly
0	i was in a hurry that night and this was the only place i could find that had a walk in available . this place is rundown , dirty and stinking . even for vegas , this place is a rip off . and they also try to shamelessly up sell . desperate and pathetic ! ! ! i have shoulder length hair , went in for shampoo and styling . it was $ 95 for that , high for a rundown place like that but was still ok since i did n't have an option . but here is what annoyed me the most though ... they charged an additional $ 10 for conditioning my hair . not deep condition or anything , 10 bucks for just using a regular conditioner after they shampoo it . now , i have been to countless salons all over the country and have never had anyone charge extra for applying conditioner when you go in for shampoo and style . and all the while the lady who did my hair , kept very shamelessly pushing for add on services ! ! ! like trim for $ 40 or applying make up or facial . it was a terrible experience . never returning . please save your money and stay as far away as you can from this place .
1	i am a `` snow cone '' snob . i grew up in hawaii where we call it shave ice because it is quite literally ice shaved so thin it 's like snow . there is a significant textural difference between what people perceive snow cones to be and what shave ice is . the texture of the ice and the flavor of the syrup really makes a difference ! having lived in vegas for over 10 years i have been unable to find anything that matches the beloved matsumotos and aokis from the north shore of hawaii . until now . snow ono is incredible ! i had heard there was a hawaiian shave ice truck here in vegas and immediately had to find out the who , what , where , when . following her on twitter makes it easy to figure out where the truck is and when at any given time . the shave ice is the bomb ! it comes in four sizes - kiddie , small , large , and bowl . you can choose up to 3 flavors - there are over 30 to choose from including local favorites pog , li hing mui , and lilikoi . ice cream , azuki beans and mochi are extra but there are free toppings such as sweetened condensed milk ( snow cap ) , li hing mui powder , and a sour spray . the price is very reasonable considering the portions are incredible - we have had the large $ 5 and the small $ 4 . long story short - they make onolicious shave ice and i will be seeking them out this hot vegas summer !
0	this is a local chain w/ locations all over the valley . only major drawback is the fact they are considered a casino , therefore smoking is allowed . you need to fight your way thru the bar area to get to the restaurant , therefore your drenched w/ smoke coming/going . the food and service is generally good . price/quality is phenominal.where can you get a good steak/salad/portato for 6.99 all the time . menu is vast , you will definitely find something to your liking . service is good , many of them have been doing it for years , they know their trade ! ! give any of these restaturants a try you wo n't be disappointed .....
0	great coke floats and memorabilia . even though you may be tempted i would not try the cokes from around the world for it is disghusting lol ... ok well .. maybe once .. but it is pretty nasty . an overall fun experience .
0	this does n't belong in an airport . if you only have 45 minutes to connect you wo n't make it . we ended up getting it to go and barely got our flight . others had to just leave without their food .
1	la pi\u00f1ata and i go back 20+ years . i was faster and leaner and dark family mexican places with great sonoran food and frozen margaritas with freshly fried chips and chunky salsa was just the ticket on the west side . i 'm older and not so lean anymore and so is la pi\u00f1ata . they still have good `` gringo '' food and i still like it . it 's hard to say whether la pi\u00f1ata and i are worn out or just comfortable , but i 'm going to keep coming
0	it was ok , but not really worth going to considering all of the better asian / sushi restaurants in the area . our server also smelled heavily of cigarette smoke - not exactly and appetizing scent . the sushi was ok , as was the seaweed salad . the pad thai though was not very good . honestly , this is a place you are safe skipping out on !
0	we went twice while staying at ti . first for lunch , shared the appetizer platter , and had the jumbo drink , then one night after we hit the strip . let 's see .... food was good .... not great ... just good . but this review is n't about the food it is all about the drinks .... aaahhh the drinks ! yummy and jumbo ! my drink cost more then my food but when it is described as big enough for two i should have known , but of course i was n't about to share ! it was yummy and fruity and was literally smokin ' when served ! the magic of dry ice ! it comes in a huge souvenir glass and i guess they will refill it for you at a 'discounted ' price . the second time we went was because we got a 2 for 1 drink coupon so we made it our last stop before bed . the night life was eehh there ..... okay for a low key place to listen to some music but not at all a happenin ' place in vegas . the bartenders thought they were much cooler then they really are and tried to flair but it just wound up to be watching some guys drop bottles all over the floor ..... anyhooo ..... the drinks are good ... not cheap but yummy for tropical fruity drinks . the coupons for 2 for 1 would keep us going back .
1	we sat at the bar both times we went and had great service . the food was consistent both times as well . if you find yourself here you have to try their chicken sand waffle appetizer its large enough to make a meal out of or share . dessert was also very yummy . happy hour is a good deal . half off drafts and wine . ca n't beat a cold $ 2.5 beer on a hot az day , the snack option is n't large for hh but still worth trying .
1	build your own burger place , you pay to add on , if you do n't like the burger then it was you own fault for picking the wrong items . i thought it was fresh and burger was good well , just like it should be . with the extras and our drinks , it was a bit pricey for a burger . but it ranks up there with other similar establishments . a fine burger place .
0	i 've had three bad experiences at this location . the pizza 's not that great . prices not that great . every time i try to get a discount they have an attitude . i will never purchase another pizza from this location again . once they messed up the order . another time i ordered online for delivery and it never showed up . they told me not to use the corporate site to order pizza online . i say then why have a website at all ? i mean what 's the point . as far as the pizza goes , the crust is decent . good texture . good taste . they skimp on the toppings . the cheese is not that great . sauce was sort of sweet like it has a lot of sugar in it , i sort of liked it . the philly cheese steak pizza however is sort of gross . it tastes like it has miracle whip on it - nasty . i expected it to taste like a real cheese steak . it certainly did n't have enough or the right kind of cheese for a cheese steak pizza . it had some sort of weird sauce on it that i did n't care for at all . if you call it a cheese steak , it should taste like a real cheese steak sandwich - it 's as simple as that . two thumbs down on this . on the other hand the cinnamon dessert pizza was pretty good . in all i give this place about a 5/10 mark on the food . this location i give a 1/10 for attitude . for quickness they are pretty quick 8/10 on speed .
0	bless me , yelp , for i have sinned . it has been far too long since my last confession ... i confess that i was n't that impressed with church brew works . oh how i wanted to love it . i mean , it 's a brewery . in a catholic church . their brilliant and creative adaptive reuse of the building should earn them at least four stars ( and you thought i was going to make some comment about my jaded catholic upbringing and how awesome it is to throw down in a church ) ; ) so then , why the three stars ? the service was less than ... eh . i listened to our waiter mumble out the description of the beers and specials like he was reading the sunday obituaries . not a great start to the meal . and the food was just ... eh . it 's trying to be 'nice restaurant food ' , but all it is is glorified bar food at restaurant pricing . and not necessarily good bar food at that . so given the lack luster review , why would i ever go back ... 1 ) it 's close to my house , so i can bike home sloshed if need be 2 ) the beers are pretty tasty ( especially the pious monk dunkel and the millennium trippel 3 ) like the good catholic i was raised , everyone deserves a second chance and lastly , 4 ) the real reason ... i can now tell my mom and grandma that i went to church this week without a guilty conscience
0	small , tiny , `` intimate '' stage within the nile theater . it 's not too bad if you have to see a small show . it 's disgustingly sweaty in the summer , but it 's kinda like the clubhouse - a great place to see a show but not the best venue ever made . i 'd love to see better bathrooms at this facility and better signs for parking . just make sure to bring ear plugs !
1	this was our first visit for dinner using a restaurant.com coupon . it was located in a strip mall on s. fort apache rd/near w. russel rd in las vegas . we shared the chicken panang curry , garlic garlic shrimp , and the sweety duck . the server brought out 3 little metal bowls of jasmine rice . the bowls were really cute . the chicken panang curry ( $ 8.95 ) was my favorite . it had large slices of tender white meat chichen . the sauce was a good consistency . the garlic garlic shrimp ( $ 11.95 ) was served on a bed of cabbage . the shrimp were large with the tails on . the sweety duck ( $ 12.95 ) was served with perfectly steamed broccoli . the entrees were a little small and pricey . the lunch specials from 11am-4pm daily look like a good deal . i would come back for lunch .
1	this is my favorite place for fresh salads . they have a plethora of fresh ingredients from several types of greens to every fruit and nut toppings imaginable . you can sample their soups before making a selection and their salted caramel creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert is the best ! every meal is topped off with fresh homemade bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry . although they 're always busy , their service is fast and the staff are very friendly . try the nuts over berries salad and their tomato basil soup . wonderful ! !
1	this is the best brewed beer i have ever had . i love the rooftop atmosphere . it 's perfect when your casually dressed . service was great too .
1	selection is decent but the crabs are awesome and bigger than most places . for the price alone killed them with the amount of crabs i destroyed ! ! !
0	went here with a group of friends and the service was n't great . food was ok. i do n't think i will be coming back here again . the server gave us the wrong check and charged the wrong amount of money on the credit card . did n't refill water , tea or coke .
0	food was good as we split a scottsdale club . smaller than expected portions on the sides . asked for chili , got a dipping sauce cup of it . sorry but that 's a shit or get off the pot thing : either do n't offer or do n't serve so small . would 've been nice to have known the price of beer . it 's not posted on the menus . had the san tan hopshock ipa . very tasty but my main quibble is we just left the baseball stadium . why are you serving me 12 oz in a plastic cup for $ 5.50 ? left the stadium to escape that ding . eh , but i 'm from oregon , i 'm used to a 16 oz pint for 4 or less . wo n't talk about the service . looked like he was pretty meh about being there . wo n't hold that against them . good experience but probably would n't recommend .
0	this used to be one of my fave philly steak restaurants but its gone now . stopped by this place for lunch , expecting a quick burger and fries . i ordered a half burger and fries . i wish the cashier had reminded that cheese and bacon were extra or offered them . price was over $ 10 with no cheese or bacon , disappointing . the burger seemed freshly grilled , but the onion slices were way too large . the fries were terribly undercooked even for someone who likes soggy fries . i will not be returning back to phony d 's
0	i have no idea what the big deal is about this place . the lines to get food belie the complete mediocrity of it . they should have stopped at 'common food ... ' in their motto . i ordered the grilled veggie omelet and was so underwhelmed that i was more fascinated by the fact that i 'd never seen a grapefruit tree before . now that was awesome . it was overpriced and underflavored . i would go back and try other things , but i do n't do heart attack food that well and i eat mostly vegetarian so i guess i 'll never be back . oh well .
0	i think a headline for lax should be `` come see carrot top ! '' ( he performs at the luxor ) because it seems as though he 's always here , and he 's one freak'n roided up carrot although he was with several decent look'n females that looked like they ate their carrots . why 2 stars ? one , its a rectangle with each side lined with table service , so what you have leftover is a small `` strip '' to shuffle your way back'n'forth down the ho chi minh trail - it reminded me of the mall .
0	we do n't have h & m in phoenix , so i have to get my fix when i travel somewhere where there is a store . i decided to make a quick trip down to the h & m store at the miracle mile shops since i was staying in the planet hollywood hotel . thank goodness i did n't have to go far because it was a really unimpressive store . to start , it 's not that big . second , the selection is incredibly lacking . except for what i bought , most everything was not cute . third , where were the summer dresses ? ? ? all i saw were shirts , shirts , and more shirts . i saw one ... yes one ... summer dress in the whole store and it was hideous . fourth , what store does n't take american express ? ? ? when the cashier told me they did n't accept amex , i was stunned . i mean , i know amex has high fees , but i think it 's the first store in three years that i have been in that does n't take it . fifth , the layout sucks . i appreciate that it was a clean store ( i had visions that it would resemble old navy ... picked over and messy ) , but the merchandise selection was disappointing . it 's a 1.5 star h & m , but i 'm rounding up to two since i walked away with three cute shirts . if you need your h & m fix while in vegas , go to the one down the street .
0	came for lunch . pretty good lunch specials . great pulled pork sliders . the sauce here is on the sweet side ... which i prefer . overall it was a pretty good meal . the waiter was overly attentive . he would pop out of nowhere and clear the plates and used napkins instantly . it was kinda annoying .
0	danny 's was a 5 star car wash 15 years ago ! today , danny 's family carousel car wash is now all about the pressure upsell ! gone is the the friendly customer service & a job # 1 attitude that kept me coming back ! i understand this is a business & there is a bottom line , but to pressure your customers to purchase more than they intend is not upselling , it is unscrupulous ! they hit you full force the second you pull into the station ! instead of earning repeat business like they use to they are trying to upsell you get the works , an oil change and windshield damage repair , and everything else they have to sell ! when you decline all the extras they disappear as quickly as they showed up & everywhere else you get nothing but bad attitudes ! they try to rush you out of there as quickly as possible , to the point that they always miss something ... i 've left there several times to find the front end of my car still covered with bug marks ! in the past several years i 've had countless bad experiences . so bad that i go out of my way not to ever use a danny 's family car wash again !
0	it 's a good lunch spot for downtown phx . i get it , i work a couple of days down by cityscape ... but today i wanted to grab lunch with my mom and kids so we decided to drive in park under ground and head up to chloe 's corner . the food was fresh and tasty , atmosphere amazing .. but no highchairs .. come on i know you are geared towards the business lunch , but kids do live in the city . they said they were on order and also no kids menu . at least a kids size and priced grilled cheese . i would come again and try breakfast once they get a high chair !
0	where to start ... have you ever eaten at panda express ? ? ? well , if you have you will have enjoyed a better meal for sure . after reading the mixed reviews i was a little leery about what to expect at jade palace . i have to say that we were seated right away and the service was excellent throughout the meal . as for the food , wow what a disappointment . we ordered the wonton soup to start and it tasted like water with very little flavor . next we had some appetizers ... beef skewers and pan fried dumplings . the beef skewers had a very fishy flavor to them as if they were mixed with something fishy in the kitchen prior to being plated for us . the pan fried dumplings were not bad , but in the second one i bit into a rock hard piece of something that was the size of a small marble . maybe it was a bone or something , but i ca n't be sure . next the main courses .. we ordered the general tso 's chicken which is kind of a staple at most chinese restaurants and all varying somewhat . it was all breading and very little chicken to be found . what we did see was a mix of some white meat and majority dark meat . overall not a tasty plate at all . we also ordered the szechuan shredded pork and this was just plain simple . thin strips of pork mixed with veggies which were not bad , but the pork was in some type of brown sauce with zero flavor . so to sum it up , i will not being going to jade palace ever again . there were just too many things that did not go right to even consider trying it again . in all honesty , the best part of the meal was the noodles and duck sauce . yes that did remind me of my days back in ny and that was great . however , in no way does this place resemble in any way shape or form ny style chinese food other than in the menu items offered . if jade palace were to open in ny it would close in a week . i have eaten in hundreds of chinese restaurants in ny from high end places like chin chin all the way to delivery places like china fun and this place does not hold a candle . too bad as we love living here in scottsdale , but the food quality leaves a ton to be desired as of yet . we will continue our search and keep fellow yelpers apprised of our findings , good or bad . by the way , i have no bone to pick with jade palace , just being truthful . when i find something good i will post about that as well with the same type of enthusiasm .
0	wish i 'd read some previous reviews before i went here . if there is n't an event in the area go someplace else . food was ok. if you want dinner in an empty warehouse this is the place to go . service was ok but not great .
0	blue goose .... sadly i would not recommend this establishment . their table service is terrible . food inconsistent . i 've been a fair few times as on my home from my horses . stupidly giving them more than 3 chances .... i can say the furniture is lovely . a sense of opulence . shame if sitting in the leathers chairs and not the restaurant one has to practically shout for someone to bring a menu .... then come get your order .... after you food comes they ( never come back again to see if everything ok ) ..... do n't come to take plates away when done and or complete the experience with a timely bill . shocking . save your money . so so many other fabby restaurants to give you time and money . cheers .
1	fantastic office ! ! dr. eric kerbs & dr jeremy skinner and their staff made the experience exceptional ! they are all very friendly , welcoming and professional !
0	sicherlich der gr\u00f6\u00dfte supermarkt in karlsruhe und n\u00e4herer umgebung . erg\u00e4nzend gibt es hier einen saturn und in einer mall weitere fachhandelsgesch\u00e4fte und dienstleistungen . der markt selber ist real , - typisch ordentlich sortiert und bietet das sortiment recht \u00fcbrsichtlich gestaltet an . allerdings habe ich mit dem markt so meine problemchen , die ich hier nicht untergehen lassen m\u00f6chte , letztendlich zu meinen 2 sternen abzug f\u00fchren und den markt f\u00fcr mich nur mittelm\u00e4\u00dfig machen : - servicepersonal : beim obst top , in den andereen bereichen naja . habe mit einem mitarbeiter bei dem trocksortiment mal leinsamen gesucht . hab mir dann auch einen spa\u00df daraus gemacht , dass mal durchzuziehen . selbst an der infotheke konnte man dem armen herrn keine regalnummer nennen . gefunden hat es dann eine andere kundin . - frische : die molkereiabteilung ist von der frische meiner ansicht nach mangelhaft . auch nach jahren kommt es mir vor , dass frische ware nach vorne ger\u00e4umt wird . anders kann ich mir nicht erkl\u00e4ren , warum 3,8 % bio frischmilch der eigenmarke an 3 samstagen hintereinander nur noch 2 tage mhd hat - bei den fischkonserven hat sich einiges verbessert , aber optimal ist das auch noch nicht . alles in allem zu empfehlen . wenn das problem mit der frische in der molkereiabteilung nicht w\u00e4re , w\u00fcrde ich hier glatt 5 sterne geben .
1	one of phoenix 's best hikes ! it 's not an easy one either , you will be amazed at the giant boulders rolling through this city . this hike requires hands at times . once you get to the top , it 's a breathtaking view of the valley of the sun . i recommend hiking this during cooler months . you will not be disappointed . perfect date ! i pack my camelback with water and some snack like cheese , nuts and granola for the top . enjoy the sunset .
0	this happened about two months ago , but i was n't on yelp at the time so i thought i 'd share now . i stopped in at the petsmart at christown mall to return an item i had previously purchased , but that our cats did not like ( a freshwater drinking fountain ) . however , because the item was over $ 50 , the cashier had to call for a manager 's approval . despite the fact that there were supposedly 3 managers on duty , the cashier had to get on the pa 3-4 times and it took 10-12 minutes for one of the managers to come forward . during the time this took , the cashier was becoming extremely agitated - apologizing to me and complaining about the store managers and how lazy they were . eventually , when the manager walked by , the cashier had to flag her down and she acted as if she was surprised that she was needed . i was tempted to say `` did n't you hear the multiple pa announcements asking for a manager to come to the front ? '' but i bit my tongue . as the cashier was finally giving my refund , the other two managers came sauntering up the main aisle talking to each other and ignoring everything else . overall it was one of the worst examples of customer service i have ever seen and i will not return to this store .
1	i really enjoyed oregano 's . the pizza is great . one of the better pizzas i have had . i visited this oregano 's twice while i stayed in mesa in january . i highly recommend the bistro classic pizza , the pesto penne bake and the pizza cookie for dessert . i had to wait 45 minutes for a table on one of my visits . it is closer to the university so very busy .
1	you know . the fall special of roasted butternut squash and quinoa was delicious . i enjoyed the meal immensely . the restaurant itself was well lit , clean , organized and efficient . soup was a tomato basil which was smooth and flavorful . the wife got a turkey sandwich with cobb salad . turkey sandwich was a touch soggy but far from inedible . overall we will be back .
1	f\u00fcr mich nach wie vor der laden in karlsruhe um meine hardware zu kaufen . mag sein das der arlt nen euro teurer wie der k & m ist , allerdings ist das ladengesch\u00e4ft viel gr\u00f6\u00dfer und es sind wesentlich mehr artikel auf lager wie beim k & m . auf meine beschwerde hin , das es keine express kassen mehr gibt , hat mich sogar der filialleiter angerufen und mit mir pers\u00f6nlich gesprochen und mich bei meinem n\u00e4chsten besuch auf einen kaffee eingeladen . man kann entweder an eine kasse mit beratung gehen und wird dann fachlich sehr kompetent beraten . oder wenn man , wie ich , schon wei\u00df was man m\u00f6chte kann man an die kasse ohne beratung gehen und einfach einen artikel aus dem lager fordern bzw . einen artikel den man aus einem regal genommen hat bezahlen . bei garantief\u00e4llen verf\u00e4hrt der arlt sehr kulant , da wird schonmal was 1:1 getauscht , obwohl eigentlich erst mal einschicken angesagt w\u00e4re . zur service-werkstatt kann ich nichts sagen , da ich als it-admin meine diagnosen selbst stellen kann und nur einzelteile dort kaufe . aber was man so mitbekommt , sind die jungs fachlich top ! von mir eine klare empfehlung ! hier wird niemand \u00fcber den tisch gezogen und es wird dem opa der nur eine schreibmaschine + internet braucht kein super schneller mega teurer computer angeschwatzt . hier wird einfach noch ehrlich nach den anforderungen des kunden das beste rausgesucht bzw . auf wunsch wird auch der individuell eigene computer f\u00fcr einem zusammengebaut .
0	this place is terrible . came here at 1130 and it 's now 3am and have n't even seen the doc . there were 3 people in the waiting room when i arrived w my pug who needed sutures . they did n't properly triage her . they did vitals 3 hours after we got there . do n't you think they are necessary to see the condition of the dog ? i heard them laughing the whole time behind the closed door . were they even working ? they never once checked in to update me on wait time . never came in to do nursing care and clean the wound . this place sucks . do n't go here if u have an emergency ur pet will probably suffer .
1	great market for the size of champaign/urbana . great variety of local meat , veggies , fresh cut/live flowers , cheese 's , hand crafts , and jewelry . i like the influx of the food trucks , but fryer tucks was first and i find myself falling back to wanting a egg , cheese , and sausage on a wheat english muffin with onions . they use eggs and sausage from the local vendors . i think cracked might also use local eggs , but not sure . there are your mainstay vendors , but every year there is some turn over with new farmers or artisans that help to make every year a little different . the live music provided by good and not so good musicians also lends to the character of the market . it is also nice to peruse the various community groups whom are out there . art mart , lincoln square mall , common ground co-op and downtown urbana are all right there also . several veggie vendors have seconds available to help save a few $ as the market is not as cheap as the grocery store . garlic in particular seems $ $ to me , but the varieties have been fun to explore and i hear tell its not as easy to grow and prep for market as onions . i will also be quite honest it 's not just about the food and crafts . for me the market is very much part of my social life . i see so many people i know there every saturday morning from co-workers , to neighbors , to random friends i have not seen in months . i 've made friends with many of the vendors and look forward to talking to them about their grandkids , their hogs not liking the left over broccoli , growing conditions , recipes , and food policy . the community i have found on the corner of illinois and vine is lively , generally friendly , and safe .
0	this place is another sad case of a confused restaurant who , in trying too hard to be innovative and sexy with flavor pairings , and trying to catch all the food trends , has achieved nothing but mediocrity . not to mention that for the same prices i can get the real gourmet version of what they are trying to do at a strip restaurant . my mahi mahi was over cooked , and had a bizzare banana and curry sauce . the sushi roll we had was edible ... if you are the type that likes american ayce places . the best thing was the burger , which was ok , but for $ 17 i expected better grade beef and more interesting bun . the service was good . i liked the waitress but in the end , i do n't think i would come back . too many other better places to spend $ 100 on dinner for 2 .
1	always mess up my order . i went in with my wife and there was 1 person behind me waiting to order . i was told that i could n't pay seperatly to get 2 stars . i had to combine my order . i could understand if they were really busy .
1	the food here is amazing ! it 's always a debate between this location and the original , because the food is great at both , but the other one is inside a bar . if you want no cigarettes , quiet relaxed restaurant , come to this location . if you want a good place to watch a game , with a full bar , etc then go to the other location . no matter which location you choose , the food will be delicious ! i know their highlight is the pizza , but do n't be afraid to try out some of the daily specials too . chris is an actual chef , not just a pizza cook . he always has interesting items that include things like homemade pasta , truffles etc . go for it !
0	for some reason , talking stick has been sending me `` free night '' stays for the whole summer , so we have been able to enjoy regular staycations for the past 4 months . this past weekend i decided to finally give the spa a shot , taking advantage of their `` luxury for locals '' deal that they have going on for the summer ( through sept 30 ) . i get massages regularly and have always been hesitant to go to hotel spas for the services as i have not had great experiences in the past . they seem to be overpriced and never as good as i want . but , with the free room and summer deal , i figured why not ! i chose to get their simply essential massage and add on the summer shine body polish . the reception area did n't impress me too much . i like to have a calming atmosphere right when i go into a spa , but i was greeted with rock music and tacky products placed all over for sale . the shirts they were selling have that cheesy `` bachelorette party '' feel and i was n't a fan of being overwhelmed with cheap jewelry and products right when walking in . the staff is friendly and quick to take you on the tour of the area , so that was a positive . i have always loved the clean , modern , and calm feel of the rooms at the talking stick . the spa decor is exactly the same - lots of rich , dark browns contrasted with lighter hues to provide a calming environment . the spa has all the typical amenities you would expect for a resort spa : changing room , lockers , fluffy robes & slippers , dressing area , jacuzzi , steam room , and relaxation area . all areas were clean and decorated nicely . i did n't come early enough to do a ton of relaxing beforehand , but got to explore the area enough . i got my massage from bernadette , and was very pleased with the quality of the session . i was worried that since it was a traditional swedish massage that she would n't get into my muscles as much as i wanted , but she did a really nice job of combining relaxation and some muscle work . the sheets on the table were amazing ... i honestly felt like i was floating because of how soft and silky they were . the body polish was an interesting experience . it 's basically a full body exfoliation using a sugar scrub , followed by rinsing off in the shower , then full body application of a body butter . it felt good , but i would probably opt for a facial or pedicure in lieu of it next time . the biggest negative during the treatment was again , the music ! i hated the music they played . it was weird and not relaxing at all ... kind of like a combination of elevator music and new age trance or something . the only other minor issue is that the massage was scheduled for 60 minutes and the body polish was supposed to be a 45 minute treatment , but in total i was only in there for 90 minutes , so i 'm not sure what happened to the extra 15 minutes . all in all it was a good experience . i would come back for their specials , and would rank this on the higher end of resort spas .
0	a cut above the sleazy downtown hotels , but they close the pool at 7 pm . never had that happen at a marriott . room is mediocre . if the convention was not here i would not stay here and next time i will walk from another hotel . inside restaurants are mediocre that we have tried . staff generally is foreign and does not speak english that we can determine . find another place to stay . there are many other better options .
1	my husband , me and our friend dined here for his birthday and let me tell you boy was he a happy guy lol . we looked at our menus and everything seemed awesome . so we first started with the crispy fried calamari which they both enjoyed it very much as i am not a fan of it but i had there yummy buttered bread served to you so hot and fresh . so the 3 of us decided to say what the hell lets get the ultimate steak for 4 . well the ultimate steak for 4 is a 80oz steak and pre sliced and included was 2 side dishes so we picked there baked mac and cheese which was so yummy and there yummy garlic mashed potatoes . it was awesome and yes 3 people did finish the 80oz steak lol . the steak was so juicy , tender and so flavorful it was worth the money if you have a group of 3 or more . we are still talking about our 80oz steak . nobody had room for dessert but since it was hubby 's birthday they sent out a piece of 7 layer chocolate cake with a glass of milk it was so cute how they prepared the birthday dish which i had called in advanced the morning of . the staff was great and the chef even came out to see how everything was which was super sweet . we had been to this steak house when we got married and we were on our honeymoon it was originally called blackstone steakhouse i believe but everything changed for the better i love the new improvements but since then the name had change to brand steakhouse this will be my steakhouse to come to when ever i 'm in vegas for sure
1	the food is amazingly delicious and authentic . great family owned and run restaurant . if you know what authentic asian food is then you wo n't be disappointed . i have read the reviews on here after dining there for the second time and just ca n't believe how some people looking for panda express orange chicken feel they can write a poor review of the food at simi 's cafe . i will absolutely be a long time customer and look forward to trying everything on the menu . the hong kong won ton soup , orange chicken , yellow thai curry and pho are all amazing ! ! ! i am so happy to have found this place . highly recommend this place , do n't let the outside fool you , go on in and enjoy everything simi 's cafe has to offer .
0	worst buffet ever ! not even worth $ 6.99 , which says a lot . the food was so salty i had to drink 6 glasses of water just to begrudgingly choke it down . they only have about 10 dishes to chose from , with only half being what i would classify as edible . i would have been better off walking next door to walgreen 's and buying pre-packaged sushi .
0	um .. two words can describe this place ... disgusting and repulsive . i came here with high expectations ! but i was disappointed .. i bought a custard filled bread ... horrible .. the bread was hard and just tasted old and way overdue ... and their pat bing soo ? was so so .. but i felt like they tried copying at the one at tiffany coffee shop ( the best in town )
0	went here for new years eve . while the evening went well , towards the end the bartenders were more sloshed than then partiers [ and observed taking multiple shots ] and refused to serve us water unless we paid $ 1- $ 3 or flashed our lady parts . ( such a deal ! video camera not optional ) i could write more , but frankly there are hundreds of places to have a drink downtown and this place should be your last last last last last last choice .
0	stale , gross , awful food . the fish was stale plain and simple , it was like the sushi you 'd find in a grocery store but more stale and dry . i had the tuna and the salmon and it was terrible , had no flavor , no quality , just cheap generic sushi . there is little variety , its the same 4 or 5 little rolls rolling around ever 2 minutes , and it gets boring real fast . the tempura was awful , it was a weird mix of fried bell peppers , those rip off slivers of potatos , and a few dry broccoli , one of the worst tempuras i have ever had . the real put off for me was the big open glass to the kitchen . you can see the guys in the back just standing around talking to each other , barely working , just taking their sweet time and not putting on any effort or charisma . they also stare at you if you are sitting nearby , that uncomfortable kind of `` what you want to eat next '' kind of stare ... you know ? arms crossed , standing stiff , no smiles , nothing , just awkward waiting around you to grab one so they can remake it . i was very uncomfortable and even wanted to move because of it , i hate people staring at me when i eat ! the decoration and atmosphere is ugly , like 70 's ugly . avocado green and orange colors , cheap awful furniture , and that whole 70 's look which is just unattractive . i gave it a try but it was just bad , like cheap dollar store bad . really . i have had bad sushi and sashimi before , i 've even had chinese buffet sushi , and this was pretty much the same thing but dryer . if you appreciate good seafood and tasty sushi , you will be sorely dissapointed by this place . go elsewhere , seriously . in terms of quality and taste , this place is a drive through , other places like blue wasabi or mikado are a real dining experience .
0	i had to down grade my rating after this last visit . i feel as though this place is not going to last long at the fast pace of uptown lunches . lunch took us over an hour and it was not due to our slow eating . i am hoping they can speed up their service so we do not lose another lunch place !
0	we 've been here a few times with our noda resident friends when visiting charlotte , and i usually opt for the wine . but this was a guy 's birthday , so we had to go for the easy guy drinks , and when they saw the high life in the glowing refrigerator case , there was no question of what we 'd be drinking . the joke 's on them , however , since it was in fact high life light . what kind of place offers such an eclectic beer selection such that they 've got dos equis , negro modelo , dogfish , etc , and high life light ( no , there was no high life ) ? obviously a wine bar . coincidentally , there were a few folks who recognized our birthday boy and wished him well , right about the time a cake came out with big fat pink candles in the shape of a 31. though it was n't his cake , it did lend a festive air to the place , and we did n't even have to worry about carting it around . we tried to convince tommy to demand a piece , but since he was only getting started , decorum won out . i do like this place , particularly with the windows open on a somewhat warm spring evening . i liked the live music , though it made it hard to hear the people next to me . and they were showing the soup on the tv behind the bar , which made for some good conversation , at least what i could hear .
0	the review ' i 've experienced better ' is a perfect description of this pretty expensive restaurant . every dish had extremely overpowering elements . the chefs in the back definitely have a heavy hand and a desire for putting truffle oil on everything ( which after three or four bites becomes nauseating ) . the pigs in a blanket were gleaming from the massive amount of butter , my surf and turf too salty , the fries loaded with pepper and mac and cheese tasted like cardboard soaked in truffle oil . i think the draw to this beehive styled restaurant is the celebrity sightings . i saw a couple of d-listers and two la lakers basketball players during my visit . if you 're into that i guess you can get past the bad food by hanging out at the bar and looking out into the dark dining room . it 'll achieve your wish and save you from the sickening food .
1	i do n't remember how we found this place , but i seem to recall hearing at one point that it was the place to go for beer . i guess that depends on what you 're looking for , but for me , i disagree . the beer was good , the ambience was nice , but the drink menu was a little short for me . they have a fair number of house beers and a few others ( some microbrews and some `` imports '' ) , and the waitstaff was pleasant if not all that fast . i would go back -- the extra blonde was delicious -- but i would n't make this my go-to place for new beer . all in , a solid hang out , but i wo n't be a regular .
1	if you like duck that has crispy skin , meat that falls apart , and flavors that meld together in your mouth , then you would most likely like this place . everyone 's already listed the highlights of this place , so i wo n't regurgitate the same review . but , i think what sheridan does with common items , like buffalo wings , is what makes his food superb . his buffalo wings were probably the best cooked wings i 've ever had ... crispy on the outside and damn juicy on the inside . you need to come try for yourself .
0	young man was very helpful in getting me into a new pair of levis , but i was surprised at the lighting in this store . it is very gloomy and dark ... weird for a dillards .
0	a co-worker of mine sent me a link to this restaurants website , and since she knows that i am trying to eat more `` healthy '' , recommended this place as a healthy alternative for lunch . so after about a week and half of hemming and hawing , i finally decided to give the place a try . i ordered a regular raspberry , pecan bowl , with pea protein , whey protein , and extra granola . . . wo n't lie . . . thought it was kinda pricey for what i ordered . . . over $ 10.00 . since the place is extremely small . . . three tables and a two seat bar counter inside , and two table outside . . . and with no place to sit , i got my order to go . 30 minutes later . . . my order finally was ready . . . definitely needs more than two people working and more seating if this place is going to be successful . . . even the ups man who was delivering a package left after 10 minutes of not even being acknowledged . oh well . . . after a short trip back to the office , i sat down to enjoy my acia bowl . . . and i was pleasantly suprised . . . i was really , really good . very tasty , just the right balance of smoothness , crunchiness , and sweetness . will i be back . . . probably . . . but if all of the seating is taken , and / or there are people waiting in line to order . . . i will probably go somewhere else .
0	i recently had lunch with a friend here . she lives by another grimaldi 's and raves about the food , but that location is too far for a workday lunch ... we started with sangria . it was not premade as any good sangria is , so the flavors of the wine and fruit can blend . speaking of fruit , that was lacking as well . i am used to sangria having pieces of fruit that one can eat , this just had sliced of orange and lemon that should have been used as garnish only . we split a small caesar salad , the small was enough to feed two ladies that are trying to watch their figure ( sorta ! ) but for heavy eaters it may not be enough to split . also split a small pizza , half white with no toppings and the other have red with mushrooms . the pizza was cooked perfectly , i love the thin and crispy crust . i really enjoyed the delicious garlic flavor of white side , which had the perfect amount of cheese . however , the other side did very little for me .. i just did n't care for the flavor of the red sauce . i still would like to go back and give the pesto style pizza a try . wo n't waste money or calories on the sangria . for the time being i can not justify anymore then a 3 star rating , but i wo n't be the least bit surprised if i find myself updating this review to add another star after another visit or two .
0	while i was planning a week long business trip to vegas , i tried to find healthy vegetarian restaurants in advance and came across this restaurant . the high prices did n't bother me because my company was paying for it , but it was the service that ruined it for me . for starters , there were 2 or 3 ladies there who barely spoke english and it took them a while to come to the register to greet me . so i order 1 enchilada $ 8.80 ) and a 2 oz shot of wheat grass ( menu said $ 1.80 for 1 oz and $ 3 for 2 oz ) . i went to pay and the lady told me to eat and pay later in case i want to buy something else . so i eat my enchilada , drink my wheatgrass , and go up to pay and it was $ 16 and some change ! i asked why it was so much ( not that i really cared , haha ) and she said $ 8.80 for the enchilada and $ 6 for 2 oz of wheatgrass . apparently they have `` updated '' prices on the wall in an inconspicuous area and the prices on the menu are no longer valid . it made no reference to the updated prices on the menu and the sign with the wheatgrass price did n't make reference to it being an `` updated '' price . after a couple of minutes back and forth and the cashier telling me that her owner was n't there and that i needed to pay $ 6 for the wheatgrass . it ended with me paying her $ 3 and giving her my phone number so the owner can call me if he dares to try to dispute this . this started out as a place where i planned on eating lunch every day during this trip , and now it 's a place that i have no plan on ever revisiting . side note : i went to get a smoothie at tropical smoothie cafe after i left ( because i did n't want to pay ( have my company pay ) the $ 8 they were asking for a smoothie , and they had 2 oz of wheatgrass for $ 2.75 .
1	awesome pizza and almost like it better heated up at home . great cheese steaks also nuff said !
0	rose & crown .. we had a good run guys . but the last 4 times i 've gone here service , food and even the beers have been terrible . i 've had to make sure that i tell anyone i previously recommended the rose & crown to that i have to regrettably revoke my recommendation so that they do n't disown me ; it 's gotten that bad . the last four times i 've been here i 've been forced to drink st mary 's pale ale since none of the other beers i want are in stock , our service is always incredibly slow , no matter how many/few customers are there , and the food ( which i honestly never loved ) has gotten greasier , chewier and less delicious .
0	since the management changed the place has gone down hill . food is terrible . never again . used to be a regular but bad cold food killed any chance of me returning .
0	i 'm glad we tried this place and that new restaurants are popping up on montford street . andrew blair 's serves american food with a southern twist- fried green tomatoes and the scallops with grits and shrimp puttanesca were great . very good service . deserves 3.5 stars
0	i got the zack 's special and it was so greasy i could n't finish and felt sick afterwards . heart attack and diabetes on a plate ..
0	the pizza itself was very good . cheesy and greasy and it surely hit the spot when i needed to satisfy my hunger . but , there is always a but , they need to update their menu on here . the prices are way off . from what we ordered according to the menu listed here on yelp , and what we paid when the food showed up , was really quite a bit difference . asides from that , i could n't see much else to fault here . or maybe that was because they made a mistake in my favor and in order to rectify that they gave me a free small pizza .
0	not really frozen custard ... more like just soft served ice cream =/ the burger is okay -- the california style burger is like a single cheeseburger from in n out but i do like their fries ... crispy and very thin . the menu is mostly ice cream and sundaes . nothing very note worthy of this place ... kinda cheap , has drive thru and big sit-in area and friendly staff .
0	i saw the mixed reviews , and thought , let 's give it a chance . it 's close , it has delivery , and i might get lucky . even after placing the order with the lady who did n't speak a lick of english ( and had to call back to repeat our credit card number six times ) , i thought `` hey , she ca n't speak english , it must be authentic ! '' well , that logic fell short . the sushi rolls were by far the worst i 've had in a while . i 'm not being a snob . i 've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just does n't cut it , especially for the prices . as for the other items : salad dressing , bleh . miso soup , alright . tempura , bland . on the positive side , i 've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content ! so here 's to my health .
1	omg , i practically inhaled my food . the kare-kare was thick and creamy . yummmm ! that was my favorite part of the meal . and my sago drink was delicious . this place was hella crackin . the line curved around the restaurant . gooooood foood ! ! ! i kinda wish i savored my meal , but whatevz , who needs to chew when you can just shallow .. lol .
1	i have n't been to the med grill yet , so i ca n't compare , but i 'm really happy with the food at aladdin 's . the portions are good and the prices are reasonable even for a poor grad student like myself ( though i will `` splurge '' on one of the juices and appetizers if someone 's treating me to the meal ) . the falafel here is excellent -- crispy on the outside , but moist on the inside . i also enjoy the pickled veggies they add to the rolled pitas . my brother , who absolutely hates getting his hands dirty/sticky while eating , thought they did a good job rolling the pitas here -- no spills . i like that they serve the dolmas and the foole m damas warm here . my one quibble is that the pita bread that comes in a basket with the appetizers . is n't served warm as well . i 've never had the tempting-looking desserts here because all the other food is so filling and delicious .
0	customer service is horrible i had eaten there a few times , had ordered delivery several times . went in today around 11 , no one in there except a waitress and her children , seated myself , she finally wondered over , i told her a wanted a pepsi with no ice , she wanted to know did i want to order , told her i wanted to look at the menu for a minute ( it was not like they were busy , no other customers ) . this seemed to make her mad . finally she came with my drink , said oh you did n't want ice , took about 10 minutes for her to come back with my drink , had a sullen expression , asked her if there was a manager , she said i would have to wait , about 30 minutes later a man came in , said the waitress was an owner and he would check with the security cameras to see if she was rude ? he took my order , brought salad and bread about 15 minutes later . after 30 more minutes he finally brought my food , told him at this point i needed it to go . gave me change in ones , i guess so i could leave a tip for the horrible customer service ? seemed to be setting up for a family birthday party , they should just close if they do n't want to have customers in there and just do delivery , that seems to work out okay .
0	went there about 10 times for cleaning as well as alterations . cleaning was fine but alterations were disappointing . they did n't do an original hem on my jeans and i was pretty clear about what i wanted . they lost my business , there is better elsewhere , keep looking .
0	the only reason i 'm not giving more stars is due to the portions and the overall expense . the service was pretty good . the food quality was very good . i know portions can be light and small at sushi places , i have been to tons all over . however most of the little selections that are offered are $ 15 to $ 20 or more each . for two people and one $ 14 drink , we both had a salad and i think we ordered about 4 different small pates off the menu . the bill was $ 150 and i needed and sandwich afterwards . the thing where you get raw meat to lay on a hot rock to sear was fun and good but maybe 2 ounces of meat total . same with the tuna and carpaccio . again , all good , just pricey and small portions . glad i tried this place but probably wo n't go again .
0	its appelbee 's , so its nothing to be overly excited about , but the food was okay and the service was fine . i ordered a cowboy burger and my friend ordered chicken fingers . i think they key to having a good experience here is to keep it simple and order things that are n't likely to get messed up . overall , its fine as a chain and much better than the fast food in the proximity , but its not fine dining , so do n't expect that .
1	i 'm a fan what can i say , i live up the street and love checking in for the daily specials , lets see , monday , half off burgers with side of fries . tuesday taco night , weds pulled pork , before i give the wrong info you should go there check it out for your self . people like it here karaoke is hit or miss but when the place is popping its a lot of fun . i do n't go to many dive bars but this place opened up a new area to start exploring .
0	my wife and i have stayed here many times during the 22 years we 've lived in southern california and have driven to las vegas . it was , for a while , `` our place '' in vegas , that is , until hilton pulled out and the `` lvh '' took over . the famous staff friendliness and professionalism steadily dwindled and we found other places to stay and make `` donations '' to . well , the lvh sent us a slew of marketing communications recently and we finally took them up on their 3 free night , with food comps and gambling free play . the first night , upon arriving , we were asked to stop at the parking garage entrance by a very polite security guard so he could `` grab some information off your car '' , which he did so quickly , then thanked us and waved us through . no biggie , and when asked , he explained they 'd had a rash of vehicle break ins lately ( a good reason right there to stay away ? ) upon returning the next evening after a day out , we were signaled to stop at the entrance to the parking garage by a different security guard ( name started with first initial `` d '' ) . he never said anything to us , until i started to inch forward thinking he was done with his silent interrogation , then he blew a gasket . he escalated the confrontation until i finally lost my temper and decided we were done , and would exit the parking garage , upon which he yelled `` f * * k you '' several times at me . we went into the hotel and filed a complaint with the hotel manager and head of security , then checked out 2 days early and went to our new favorite property , who welcomed us back and comped our room needless to say , we 'll never return and i 'd strongly recommend you find other accommodations too . so sad to see this historic property run into the ground !
1	i really wanted bbq last night , and wanted to try something new and different . came on yelp and found this place . its in a cute little part of gilbert , and around several other resturants in a nice part of town . parked my car and went inside . i loved the decor ! ! omg ! huge , spacious , very open and pleasantly decorated . plenty of seating ! menu is front and center , and very easy to read and make sense of . you have several options and dishes to chose from ... i went for the small selection of the beef brisket in sauce , with 2 sides . i did the beans and corn . they also have a little station in the middle with bbq sauce , onions , peppers and such . the line itself kind of has a boston market feel to it . you grab a tray , and place your order with the gal behind the glass . she scoops your food for you , and passes it underneath the glass . take your food to the end of the line , pay , and there you are . they have 3 different seating areas . in the resturant they have seating , with booths and benches . the second seating area is picnic tables in an air conditioned garage type area . you actually have to go through a set of doors and sort of leave the resturant to get to this part . the third seating area is picnic tables competely outside .... no covering , no ac . yea . not for me . i like eating indoors ! i would return to this place , but my only true complaint is the drink station . in order to refill your drink , you must cut back into the line to get to the drink station . bad idea ! i can see people getting fussy and annoyed and think your taking cuts when your really just trying to get more dr. pepper . they need to have a second station somewhere so people can refill their beverages and not cut back into the food line to do so ! big pain in the butt , and i docked them a full star for it . this place is plenty big enough to throw a second beverage station somewhere in the layout of the store . i will return here for eating again , as i did enjoy my experience .
0	we were very underwelmed . i had reserveration @ 7pm for 4 , were seated and waited 20 minutes before someone came over and served us water and said i 'll be back to get your drink order . another 5 minutes the assistant manager came over and started apologizing that someone would help us soon . my husband was getting upset so she just ran got a pen and took our drink orders . we ordered our food which was ok , we did have the couple appetizier then short ribs ( good ) but our califlower came out 10 minutes after we were served our ribs . would n't recommend , would n't go back . this was our second visit , the first time was much better .
0	worst rental experience ever ! ! the staff was unprofessional and aloof . when asked if we were waiting for a car , we replied `` yes '' , the staff person walked off without telling us what was happening . he never returned . 10 minutes later i aproached a sixt employee asking for help . ( there were a few people sitting on chairs , conversing loudly ) . when i asked for help , they huffed and walked off . no indication that our car was coming . 20 minutes later , we asked for help from another employee regarding our car . after 30 minutes our car finally arrived . it was unclean and the employee was reluctant to put body damage on the rental form . this is completely unacceptable . i will never rent from this company again .
0	now granted i 'm opposed to the idea of mongolian grills in the first place for the usual reasons , but at least with flat top nothing is frozen , it 's nice inside , and if you go up a few times it 's a good deal ( well , for lunch at least ) . the whole ambiance of huhot just felt trashy .
0	note that i went here for happy hour i ordered their $ 6 happy hour burger and at my server 's commendation the happy hour carpaccio . not sure if it was because of happy hour or not , but the burger i received was sort of small for one with a normal retail of $ 13.95 . lets break it down into parts . the bun- fairly dense and hearty bun that soaked up the juices and did n't fall apart on you when eating it . not really the most flavorful , but a good base for the burger . the patty- smaller than the bun ( not a good sign ) , seemed to be a coarsely ground and actually really juicy . just the way i like it , except for one major flaw . i asked for the burger to be cooked to medium , and the burger i received was well done . not sure i like that an expensive steakhouse overcooked it 's beef . the patty was a little too salty too . toppings- 2 small pieces of bacon that probably would have made 1 regular sized strip . the lettuce and tomato were cheap though and there was no onion to go with the burger . ( reviewing my photo there was onion , it was just so small and thin that i could n't taste it ) . this level of veggies i would expect in a fast food place . cheese was nicely melted but wish it had a stronger flavor . sides- the fries were decent , but the portion once again small . the carpaccio was n't that good to me . i liked the toasted parmesan bread they served with it , but the beef itself did n't seem that fresh to me with a pale color that was starting to turn grey around the edges . maybe the beef was perfectly fine , but it just did n't look that fresh to me . of course maybe i just did n't eat it fast enough either . i felt like i liked the carpaccio at va bene down the street a bit more . so why did i give this place a 3 star review although i did n't really think the place was that good ? because i think the price i paid was worth the meal i got , no more no less . not a value buy like i was expecting , but decent overall .
0	only been here a few times , but each time i have had to wait at least 10 , if not 20+ minutes for a drink . and it does n't seem to matter if it 's early evening outside on a 1/2 empty patio or inside at the bar on st. patrick 's day . the last time we were outside on the patio , which was about 3/4 full after work , happy hour-ish , and it took 20 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged us , another 5 before she came back to take our order ( 3 beers and 2 shots ) , and a good 15 or so before the drinks came out . we contemplated getting the order in for the second round when she delivered the first one but thought `` nah , how bad could it be ? '' . well , the drinks were drained and we sat for another 10 minutes after that before she came back by to see if we wanted more , and then it was seriously 10 after that before they were delivered . so , we had been there an hour and had n't even had the opportunity to get two rounds of drinks consumed . ( and they were just not that busy and not that understaffed . the entire indoors was empty and there were hosts/hostesses/waitstaff standing around chatting in the doorway . ) there are so many better options out there .
1	i really like the decor at this restaurant . went with some friends for brunch on a weekday , and it was n't crowded . you can find a table pretty quickly . the waitresses were extremely nice and gave suggestions when we 're confused . i ordered the brunch , which had two eggs , sausage , ham , bacon , and your choice of bread . i chose bagel because of its name ! obviously it was n't st. viateur or fairmount , but it was really moist . the price is pretty decent for a breakfast place , it comes up to around $ 10 altogether with coffee/tea . the atmosphere is really quaint and cute . i 'll definitely come back again to try out their large selection of omlettes !
0	coming to las vegas , you just have to go off strip . there are so many interesting places you can find outside of the overly hyped and overly priced brand name famous restaurants on las vegas blvd . this is one of them ! portions here are huge ! ! ! ! ! i mean hugeeee ! ! bring lots of friends so you can try more than one dish at a time . a must try !
0	i gave this place 3 stars based on the following : - their french onion soup is delicious and one of my favorites - i hate to say this but ... left bank and costco make a juicier and flavorful roast chicken ... ours was so dry it could mop up the glass of wine we spilled . hahaha . - they served a box of popcorn to each table . what the hell ? ? ? so weird . i did n't get it . does anyone know the logic behind this ? - be specific about where you 'd like to sit , otherwise they 'll put you in a random spot with the foot traffic of waitstaff and patrons circling around you like a swarm of bees . i prefer the solarium-type room or patio seating to the dark , cavelike atmosphere of the interior rooms . - hostesses are pretentious ( this is pretty funny ) - the waitstaff are pleasant . - it 's a fun place to have a meal and watch the fountain show at bellagio . - again , the french onion soup is quite tasty . : ) - these guys close waaaay to early .
0	we only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated , but that was about the only good thing about this place . the staff was not very friendly and it was difficult to recognize them with their plain cornflower blue t-shirts . we asked for separate checks as soon as our server arrived . he replied , `` we 'll deal with that at the end . '' okay ..... so , we ordered , and the menu was very expensive . $ 10 for a 12 oz . domestic draft deer . i thought that was ridiculous . the entrees were also p [ ricey- i paid $ 17 for a grilled cheese and fries . the food was ok , but not worth the money . then , to top it off , when we asked for the check , he gave us 1 check with 20 % gratuity added . we reminded him about separating it . he then went back to his register and took about 20 minutes to slpit everything up and process our payments . yes , i understand that splitting checks is a pain , but honestly , it 's more and more common these days , especially in a tourist area like vegas . the servers and establishments need to adjust to their market . i am a local , and will not be going there again . i thought for a $ 33 bill total , the servers should at least be wearing a collared shirt ....
0	i tried this place again because i was in the area and i needed a place to hang out and grab a bite to eat . i ordered the curry coconut waffle and fresh fruit . the waffle was very doughy just as my pancakes were from october 2013. i informed the waiter and he took my plate and made me another . however , the second was still doughy , but not as bad as the first . i did n't send the second one back , but i should have . i wo n't go back for breakfast the next time i 'm in the area . i have n't tried the lunch and am willing to give that a try since my son 's sandwich looked great and he enjoyed it . stay away from the pancakes and waffles !
0	ok , first time i was here was for lunch . i had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers i had ever had . noticed the pool , darts , pinball , golden tee , and ancient bowling game and thought i would take my friends back there and share this incredible place . two days later , for dinner and drinks , 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a friday night . she was cooking , bartending , handling money , scratching her head , shaking hands , cleaning bar tops , running dishes , etc .... did i mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time ? we ate our dinners , disgustedly , thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it . she was entertaining , all over the place , yelling , throwing things , etc . i 'm pretty nieve , and did n't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time . so there we have it , a restaurant i thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that does n't observe any food safety laws or regulations . i 'll be getting my hepititis c test next week . ( joking .... kinda )
0	the only good thing about this place was my fried pickles . the service was bad , but i ca n't blame the waitress for that . the place was full and she was the only one running around . it took about 10-15 mins when we were sat down for anyone to ask what we wanted to drink and almost a 20-25 min wait for us to get our food . when i got my wings they were cold and dry . more staff and the service would probably have been better .
0	food was great as always at ok , but service was pretty bad . slow to take order , food took nearly 30 minutes with a slim crowd . never checked back to see how things were or if we needed anything else ( we did ) . not bad enough to keep from coming back , just a tad disappointing ..
0	this review is a couple months overdue . the mac and cheese was cold and tasted gross . the ribs were dry . my husband ordered the half chicken and today he has been showing signs of foodborne illness ( diarrhea , etc ) . the ' c ' grade on the wall issued by the health department should have been a red flag .
1	this is my first cirque de soleil show i watched in vegas ! i thought it was cool . a lot of acrobat , artsy stuff , and music that will keep you watching . if you are into acrobat , artsy dance with deep meaningful music then this is the show for you ! however ! i felt that it was the longest show ever ! my friends and i got seats toward the middle back , it was still a good view of the show . i would n't want to sit to far close to the stage because of the surprises you will encounter ! i thought there was a storyline to this -- but i still do n't understand what 's the storyline ... they say 'no flash photography allowed ' but i think its more like 'no recording allow ' the ushers sure do have a good eye when you take your camera out and aim it at the stage . lol there were some audience behind me that were aiming their camera at the stage -- and the usher came right at them ... it was dark too !
1	it 's probably all been said but hey i just climbed echo canyon and i wan na throw my stars in ! to all the people i 've met who 've lived here longer than i and who have climbing it on their list of things to do just go ahead and do it . camelback gives goooood feeling ! i have had the pleasure of hiking in many countries and i absolutely dig this kinda big boulder hiking with steep inclines , narrow crevices , and rock overhangs to sit beneath . we saw about 4 iguanas sunning , lots of hummingbirds , a squirrel , and 2 chipmunks . i failed to see what landed on my shoulder and bit me , : ( , a bee perhaps , but i smacked it away and my friend extracted the stinger from my skin ! ( i do n't know what prompted the sting but i definitely wo n't wear white again . my tank was loaded with little black flying things and the others i met on the trail wearing white had the same complaints . extra bugs due to the rain i hear . ) and hey fellow hikers , that 's a good sense of community you have there on the trail ! best part -- -- climbing back down , sorta run/climb/jumping the rocks ! ! ! it was hottt today , yeah , but we had a sweet breeze , lotsa water , a few luna bars , and an apple . be prepared , and take time to enjoy the journey !
0	i 'm sorry , but this place is just plain skanky . i am all about supporting local businesses ... so long as they are clean , have a pleasant staff , and a good concept .
0	pretty darn good ! fast delivery ( took way less than 45-50 min ) although i will say ordering was a bit of a process due to some language barriers ( on both ends ) . the sesame chicken was fairly crispy as requested and the sauce was not sickeningly sweet thankfully and had a nice flavor ! for $ 8 combo with rice and choice of spring roll or egg roll it was a pretty cheap dinner . the crab rangoon were delicious and perhaps my favorite part of the meal . not sure what was up with the fried rice without egg or veggies or anything ... i 'm not sure if it is a charlotte thing but the last two places i 've gone have been like this . i also was n't a huge fan of their egg-rolls - since i prefer mine with a little more flavor . i will give it another shot because i thought the chicken sauce was one of the best i 've had in a long time .
0	came in for scan . was given questionable water in a white plastic container with a paper cup and told to drink it all . i asked about where it came from and was told from the staff kitchen and it was not tap water . i was given a second white plastic container with water right before my scan and asked to drink it . i felt very uncomfortable with this procedure because there was no way of knowing 1 water source 2. cleanliness of container that gets reused , refilled over and over again 3. total disregard of operating a professional lab by giving out questionable and unsanitary water instead of a sealed bottle of water . this caused a lot of stress . 4.later on i callied in and spoke to nicki , the office manager and related info above to her . i was told that i was the first person to complain , thus shaming me for bringing an unsanitary practice to her attention . i am writing this review so that if it happens to you , know that you are not the first person to question this unsanitary practice . i hope smil decides to change this reckless practice and use sealed bottled water so that there are no questions or worries .
0	i love getting my eyebrows done here but their payment plan sucks ! ! i signed up for the plan with out being informed that they take money out of your account . so now i have a overdrawn fee because of me not being aware of that ! i would 've liked to know that they do that while i was signing up for the plan instead of it happening now when i have an overdrawn fee !
0	what the hell is sumomaki ? i 'd never heard of it but soon learned through a quick google search that it 's a large roll ( hence the name ; cute but gross ) with cream cheese and spicy mayo ( even jalapeno , apparently , at some other places ) . barf . if that 's not nauseating enough , you should check out the `` sushi desserts , '' which we found too terrifying to mock . starving and desperate , we tried to order the most normal-sounding items on the menu . thank the lord , mine had to be freshly prepared and was acceptable , as long as i could shut the other stuff out of my mind . my parents , poor souls , had to eat refrigerated sushi that had been made who knows when . tasted like cardboard . i do n't know what got into us , but we even took some back to the hotel for my brother-in-law , who must have thought my sister was leaving him . i 'm all about innovation , evolution , and pushing boundaries . but these ridiculous concoctions are criminal . just leave my sushi alone ! !
0	food was great especially the roast lamb . was a bit disappointed they served boring fries with the steak though and the service was frosty .
1	i stayed here for a weekend visit to lv and my friend 's townhome is so cute . modern , safe and clean it was so nice to visit a complex in this side of town that was n't just square units stacked on each other ! the private garages make it safe for young professionals and singles to live and gives an awesome look to the grounds . the gym was well kept , the equipment was great and the pool was heated ! such a nice amenity for those random spring cold fronts ( like what i experienced in april ) whenever i move back to lv ( 2017 , hopefully ! ! ) i will take a second look here and consider calling these adorable townhomea home for my little boy and i !
0	i wrote a review on sunday and now it 's gone ? it was about their very , very poor service . where do the reviews go that are up on the yelp website and then disappear from the businesses page one is reviewing ?
1	being in the military , i 've had countless haircuts literally all over the world . my haircut is pretty standard fare , but it is very easy to mess up if you rush or take shortcuts . i get a # 2 on the top , a skin tight fade about medium height , and get my line hooked up . i come to vegas pretty often because my in-laws live here , so finding a barber is a necessity for me . i take my haircuts very seriously and a bad cut can ruin my whole day ( i do n't even bother with super cuts or sports clips type places ) . the previous place that i had been to in vegas was the art of shaving at mandalay shoppes about 3-4 years ago . elliot from elliot and co. was `` freelancing '' there and he is probably the best barber i have ever run into . however , e & c and taos are more for special occasions because the cost a bit prohibitive . which brings me to head hunterz - it reminds me of my normal barbershop in san diego `` superior cuts '' by the chula vista mall . you got sports on the tv , people arguing about who knows what , and a queue of cats waiting for their usual barber . the bottom line is that everyone in head hunterz can cut - i was very pleased with my `` usual '' and the 18 dollars is about what i pay in ca and what i used to pay on the east coast . you will not be disappointed with the quality of the cut , but they might hurt your feelings in some of the heated discussions !
0	their regular pizza is par , but it 's the chicken and buffalo fries pizza that i go back for . the most amazing not-really-definable-as pizza i 've had .
1	went here on our last night in vegas over memorial day weekend . it was a saturday night , we had a reservation but still not very crowded . service was so-so . the waiter was attentive when he was talking to us , but did n't come around very often . other than that , this place is absolutely delicious . their chicken meal is quite possibly the best i 've had in my entire life ! the green bean side is delicious , especially with the touch of almond . my date enjoyed the prime rib and said it was amazing . left very satisfied , but not `` too '' full - we pretty much stopped being hungry the moment we got to vegas , because there is so much food and drink we were always eating ! i ca n't comment on the wine/beer/drink because , looking out at the floor where they 're free , we could n't stomach paying upwards of $ 10-15 a pop . the prices here are a little high , but at the end , the food was so good we did n't even care . delicious ! might come back next time we 're in vegas ! also , the place is really cool looking inside ! great decoration , aside from being smack against the casino floor .
1	this place is damn good . they used to have a pastrami sandwich that was to die for , but it is no longer available . saddened i got a cheesesteak that was one of the best in memory . solid . i 've never had the pizza so ca n't speak to that , but the sandwiches are proper . note that there are very few places to sit . you order at the counter . no table service or anything . enjoy .
1	have used vidal sassoon salons for many years in san francisco and chicago when i lived in those cities and used the scottsdale salon when visiting phoenix from my home in texas . yesterday at the scottsdale salon , mark gave me the best haircut ever . my hair is very fine and tends to be limp and flatten out after five minutes , but thanks to mark 's skill my new ( very flattering ) cut gives my hair `` movement '' and it seems thicker . i wash my hair daily and today the cut looks as good as when mark styled it . a quick shake and the cut falls miraculously back into place ! all the staff members were friendly and professional ( as they have been on previous visits ) . my only complaint is i do n't have a sassoon salon closer to home in the san antonio area ! thank you , mark !
0	tried 4 different flatbreads , 3 sushi , lobster linguini , meat balls , 3 different beers , cocktails , and white wine , nothing is good . the only thing that is fine is the chicken flatbread . the server , darius , is attentive and friendly while others are not . will not come back unless i take my puppy here to enjoy their patio and open air .
0	mcdonalds inside the luxor food court . all the food was over priced vs typical mcdonalds . the fries were soggy and limp instead of their usual golden cripsyness .
0	do not rent from avis ! charged for picking up car 29 minutes early at an hourly rate of 61.50. wanted to turn car in one hour late and told i 'd have to pay that rate . that 's unacceptable , and customer service rep. unbendable even with extenuating circumstances .
0	what 's there to say really . the food sucks and the famous frozen hot chocolate was nothing special . children and women may enjoy it but not so much if you are male and of voting age .
0	hard to get seating on saturday and the noise level is high . nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and good at what they do . the scallop appetizer and salads were good . i had issue with the pasta and you cant have issues with pasta in an italian restaurant . the marinara sauce was too much tomato tasting acidic and lacked balance . the spinach ravioli was too much cheese and cream , again not balanced . this place has all the elements of a good dining experience but the kitchen needs to up the game for my taste .
0	i would hate to see this place packed with people . when we came , there were maybe 5 tables full , if that . the service was extremely slow , we waited forever to give our drink order , then forever to order , then forever for the food . it 's pricey for the quality of food that they are serving . the waitress however was super nice . i would n't waste your money here , there are to many other options here in vegas to eat at a place like this .
1	i love this place , they are fast and they do a good job . the staff is really nice . yes , it is true that they want to sell you every product and promo when you are there , but you can just say that you are not interested . i really recommend ewc ! ! !
1	i have to agree with reed . this place does take airport food , & make the `` airport '' go away . we had a significantly above mediocre experience -- and it was stellar for airport dining . not only were the employees very nice . but our food was good , and we actually enjoyed our experience . and believe me , we were grumpy because our nonstop flight somehow transformed into an undetermined delay in phoenix that we were not planning on . having an nice place to dine at the airport , while we waited in frustration was very comforting . i was able to order an omelette to my liking , sans any gluten or milk products , and my travel companion enjoyed a really delicious looking pasta .
0	meh . first time we 've had chinese food that was just ... meh . little flavor . i had the moo goo gai pan and my wife had the sweet and sour chicken . her was watery .. thin . we both added salt . waiter was lackluster as well .
0	okay , got a suite . nice room , the hotel smelled like strong perfume
0	staff/cashier seemed ( to us ) she rather be elsewhere than working . tepid reception . no `` aloha '' attitude in hawaiian spot . prices were slightly on the pricey side after recieving our dishes . portions were small for the price they charged us . location is closer to us than aloha kitchen ... a plus ! ^_^ love the decor , and the al fresca seating . we also order a coconut smoothie which the server/cashier forgot to serve to us ( her mates came over and started socialising instead ) . we had to remind her that we also order the smoothie a couple of times . once we recieved it , it was more like a shake than a smothie . overall , we are unlikely to return here . sorry , luvies . xx
0	i went back to kabuki , as promised . boy have things changed in two weeks ! they no longer have a reverse happy hour , though their website still said so on friday , june 13 , 2008 , which is the date i dined there . the service was slow and very rude . i felt that the server was disappointed we decided to eat there . the hostess was also very rude and avoided eye contact , tossing our menus onto the table and turning around before introducing any specials or saying a server would be right with us or something . it also took almost 20 minutes to receive our check at the end of our meal , though we were one table out of only about eight that were left among several servers . several servers were also gathered around a table of guests seated near us , laughing and chatting , while the rest of us waited for service . this experience was so terrible for the boyfriend and i that we will not be returning again . what a turn for the worse ! forget everything i said in that first review ; now this place has shown its true colors !
0	i think the food was great . i did not like the wait and noticed that empty tables were left empty for a considerable time . the huevos rancheros were okay . i am not sold on the diced chicken . i thought the tortillas should be fried a bit too . the pancakes were okay . nothing incredible . maybe i was expecting more because of all the reviews but i found it to be just okay . however , if you like hawaiian breakfasts , then this may be your place to go . loco moco was very good .
0	the pizza had sooooooo much cheese , it was way toooo much . ( that we were putting it aside when it slide off the pizza not needing it back on the pizza ! ! ) the service was okay . i do not like the primitive way they write out tickets you ca n't read them and it feels like the owner just rings up whatever ! ! not to mention how uncomfortable i was the out dated and sardine can feeling bathrooms ! !
0	i was excited to go there after seeing them on cupcake wars , and the cupcakes were great . however the service was horrible . the first time we went the young lady was rude and seemed annoyed that i asked her about the cakes from the show . the second time we went we arrived there at 540 and the window said it closed at 6 but the door was locked . when i called to ask them why they were n't open since it was n't 6 yet he hung up on me .
1	when i am in arizona , its usually because i am there for a dodger game . with my busy day at camelback ranch , one of my supervisors had suggested going to a casino in scottsdale . i was n't aware there was one and should have visited before . glad i found one of the luxurious casinos in arizona called talking stick . at the hotel i was staying , there were pamphlets for harrah 's ak-chin and talking sticks . when i saw talking sticks , i had to pay a visit and try out my luck . i had arrived on a thursday evening and it was crowded . i had realized when i got back to work that nascar was in town when i paid a visit . thus , explains why the huge parking lot still seemed small . as i mentioned , the parking lot is huge ! walking to the casino is very easy . lots of lights and paved pathways to the casino . plenty of parking for small cars to huge rvs . i was n't sure if i was walking to a casino or i was going to work at night . valet areas are elegant and the entrances are just as magnificent . i walked in and it was loud . machines ringing , people shouting , and lot of music playing . there is a huge poker room with lots of people throwing money on the table . i was n't able to dine at talking sticks since i was busy gambling . there are a lot of servers going around making sure you are good and spending more $ $ $ $ . you 'll find blackjack , poker tables , and many different denominations of slot machines . i even made sure i signed up for the player rewards club . i was hoping to get a free buffet one day : ) talking sticks was a very high class casino and probably is and was a better option than harrah 's ak-chin . i had a nice chat with a girl that was next to me , but i wish i had n't left my chair to get more money and she was gone . i was n't sure if she was lady luck or just me pretending i was talking to someone . i did n't win at the casinos , but i did have a fun experience . i hope to get some freebies from talking stick when i come back . do you think i write too much ? well , you can call me a yelp-o-holic !
0	the food is always good , the service , not so much . there were 4 of us in the car , the lady taking out orders keep interrupting us and would not let use give her all the complete order . she also keep talking to other people in the store . add to it all she did not get our order quiet right !
0	i was fine with staying here for the short time i was in pittsburgh . the only thing that really bothered me , besides the really loud people at night the first night ( really thin walls ) , was that there was no fan in the bathroom . it got really steamy really quickly and the only way to let out the steam was by opening the door . you can tell the bathroom was updated , although the sink was a little high for this 5 ft girl . the front staff was really friendly checking in and checking out . the pool was clean , for the most part . bed was firm and pillows were soft . i brought my own pillow just because i sleep better when i do , but the hotels were perfectly fine to lay on . i think the location was great , easy to find and close to the city where we wanted to be . all in all a fine place to spend a few nights while sightseeing around pittsburgh .
0	when i called for delivery they said it would take an hour and a half , i thought that was a long time , but we were n't that hungry yet . after 2 hours and 20 minutes they finally arrived , with cold food . they did n't offer a discount or any way to make it right .
1	a requirement of my job as a retail manager is to renew my state of nevada health card and alcohol awareness handling card every four years . the first thing i want to bring up is that there is a major difference between the southern nevada health district office ( snhd ) in henderson and the alcohol awareness training office off sunset road in henderson . where the snhd gave me the impression of being both an inconvenient tax and socialism in the shadow of the las vegas strip , spending time in the alcohol awareness training class was enjoyable . thanks to our trainer steve which i will yelp about soon . a major advantage of this alcohol awareness training office is that it is by sunrise coffee . i am the type of person that strives to get to an appointment or yelp event early . so , having sunrise coffee a few steps away was nice . i parked my car , relaxed with a cup of coffee and when it was near the time of the class , i had the awareness that i needed to walk a few feet . unlike alcohol which you 'll be spending hours learning about , caffeine is a stimulant that keeps you awake for hours . regardless that steve is an enthusiastic instructor , the caffeine that kept me awake was appreciated . now a major disadvantage of the alcohol awareness training classes are that they are only held on weekdays at 10 am and 2 pm . online courses are available . however , you will hear to go there in person to complete the process of your picture card and payment . and by the way , plastic is no longer an acceptable payment option here . my first impression of this office is that the staff working here are real . as soon as i walked in instantly the friendly woman in the office greeted me . next i was filling out the simple paperwork . there are zero piles of paperwork to fill out here . plus there is no condescending blockheads that populated the staff at the snhd . here they went out of their way to help you where at the snhd they treated you as an escape goat for their miserable attitude . when i filled out my paperwork it was in the only classroom . this is a relatively small business in a small sunset road shopping center that is across from sunset park . i occupied one of ten bridge tables and twenty seats . i was never isolated from the outside world . the plate glass windows overlooked the drive thru action at sunrise coffee . in front of me was a tv playing a movie . on the walls around me were motion picture posters . but in back of me was an outlet to charge my phone between the paperwork and picture taking . the second part of the experience is smiling for the camera in front of the american flag . this is the you that you will see for four years on your alcohol awareness card . our instructor steve is the epitomy of an outstanding instructor . he is resourceful and entertaining . ironically he is the type of guy i would like to to drink alcohol with . moreover he is the type of guy i like as an instructor . he interspersed jokes before and between critical talking points . an example is , `` i have to do pictures . i 'll do a group shot to get it over with . '' when he brought up the increase in the city of las vegas ticketing businesses , after that talking point he joked , `` i think they have to raise money for the soccer stadium . '' this is my second time at this office , and steve has made alcohol awareness enjoyable . in comparison when i attended the tam class on sahara it was zzzz . after so many reviews written from experiences at bars it was a learning experience taking in the information about alcohol . i never knew that it affects the small intestine more than the liver or that it affects you right away . or that it puts your brain cells to sleep . the information this class taught me made my brain cells wide awake . steve leads the class through videos and reading materials . it is usually a four hour class . what steve wants you to be especially aware of is carding customers , knowing when to stop serving a drunk customer , and the general fundamentals of the law applying to serving alcohol . steve also brought up the increase in enforcement of alcohol handling laws . the number of citations is serious with four southern nevada police departments handing out around 1,000 tickets in a month . plus , tickets for employees failing to have an alcohol awareness card on them coats $ 500 . this is $ 480 over and above the $ 20 fee for the class . when all is said and done , my alcohol awareness training card is good for four more years . this means i will not be a duke here . however say if my card was lost or stolen , steve stated that they will replace it at no charge . i conclude this review with a shout out to steve . hopefully if i am accepted into the clark county school district arl program , steve will be the role model of the teacher that i would strive to be . if i do n't get accepted their is a chance i will be seeing steve in four years .
1	the good : - gnocchi appetizer , ridiculously tasty - meatballs , second only to bistro la bon - fennel sausage carbonara , beautifully balanced dish - braised lamb shank , best in town . - atmosphere , rarely you see this commitment to aesthetics in charlotte . big budget finish out translates to stately or big city feel . you 're someplace special the bad : - service was a little indifferent . felt like i may be wasting his time at first , but got better mid meal . - too many banquettes for a large restaurant . wanted more space to dine in this environment . - were rushed at the end of our meal . did n't let me set the pace at the end , pet peeve of mine . highly recommend . request a booth . plan to overeat .
1	these are the best ribs in town ! i 've eaten here half a dozen times . i hear they have chicken too ... never tried it as the rib portion is humongous ! ! you must go . casual place , jeans are fine . decor is dated but part of the atmosphere for a great rib joint ! unbelievably fast with the meals too , service is great . i 've spent a fair bit of time down south . these are not the same kind of bbq as you get in the southern us , not really apples to apples . compared to most of the us , and canadian rib joints i 've been to , these are great !
0	service was extremely slow . it was 20 minutes before our drinks order was taken . drinks were very slow to arrive too . meals arrived and my sliders were cold . no water was available on the table . overall , quite disappointing . upside - location was good .
0	got say not happy i was staying at the holiday inn here and mesa and was in the mood for something italian so i thought i would try it here ...... wrong place . the price was ok the delivery time was ok but the food completely miss the mark ! i got lasagna , garlic bread , and minestrone soup . the soup had no noodles or beans and was very spice . the garlic bread was the only thing that was kinda ok but still left much to be desired . and when it comes to the lasagna ..... idk what it was but it was n't lasagna i had two bites and through it away worst ever ! so with all that said if your looking for good italian look somewhere else .
0	everything tastes like it was frozen at one time , maybe not , but then they need to clean out their reefer ? this is the second time i 've visited hoping to try something different , only to be disappointed about it 's preparation . the wings are great as is one of their `` signature dishes '' their `` shephard 's pie , '' but i 'm not sure what else is . my suggestion would be to ask your waitress what is fresh and what started out frozen . otherwise it 's a pub , they show sports , you play pool , you drink beer , and you enjoy the view , everything somehow tastes better after you 've been there a while .
0	i was n't a big fan of the location . this is definitely a small boutique style hotel , no lobby and no amenities to make you feel like you can grab a drink or work outside of your room . the room and service were nice , but that 's all i appreciated .
0	while the facilities are nice the prices are not . everything i needed was on average $ 1 more than smith 's and smith 's in not the cheapest either . only shop here if you have coups !
0	almost missed my plane because `` 5-7 minutes '' was more like 15-20 , and the line was too long to get a refund for an $ 11 pizza . avoid at all costs .
0	i really loved my server ashley and the lit eiffel tower in the center of the restaurant . now for the bad part . we ordered the spinach/frisee salad , duck confit with white bean cassoulet and steak with `` frites '' two drinks were ordered : a bloody mary and a french martini recommended by ashley . both drinks were well prepared and strong . the spinach/frisee salad was fresh with bacon dressing , a poached egg and lardons . it was fresh but nothing to write home about . the duck leg confit was abysmal . while my husband was eating i saw his unenthused expression , so decided to take a taste of it . the duck leg he was served had to have been sitting around their refrigator for a while prior to being served . i can not believe that zinc bistro would serve such an unappetizing , unflavorful , dry `` meat '' . when we got home , i asked my husband why he did n't tell the waitress how bad his food was and his answer was that he did n't want to spoil my birthday dinner . i would have been kicking and screaming before i would eat anything so vile . my steak and frites were nothing like i am used to in paris ! ! ! the steak was cooked medium rare , au poivre but the meat had no flavor whatsoever . it also had an excessive amount of peppercorns . a person who sat across from us returned his steak because of this . i have eaten steak au poivre many times both in the us and abroad . this is definitely an excessive use of peppercorns . none of the restaurants i have experienced do it this way . does n't mean that zinc bistro ca n't be unique . but , it must be unique and edible . the frites were a total disappointment . they could not have been from fresh potatoes -- -no way , no how . no way , no how ... how many times can i say this ? in parisian bistros the frites or fries are to die for -- -simply sprinkled with salt and they are amazing . zinc bistro 's fries had this or that sprinkled on them but this did not improve the lack of flavor from the potato . omg , what can i say about a restaurant that charges more than a parisian bistro but none of its flavor . one saving grace was that they gave me a complementary mini-chocolate souflee as i was celebrating my birthday . zinc bistro management .... check that duck confit dish .... go into the kitchen right now and taste it . get ready to spit it out . i am feeling super-uber guilty that my husband ate that vile dish and kept quiet about it so he would n't spoil my birthday dinner . zinc bistro , how long can this quality of food continue before scottsdale patrons realize that they are not eating anything like what is served in a parisian bistro . i have to give zinc bistro one star -- earned by ashley and the complementary chocolate souffle .
1	good local place , pretty decent food , and the best cinnamon rolls ever ! i ca n't eat any baked goods from super markets ( yuck ) . i am very picky when it comes to sweets but these hit it out of the ballpark !
1	if you 're looking for a challenging hike , echo trail is the place to be ! this is by far my favorite hike in phoenix . it 's only 1.2 miles long but the incline makes it feel longer . if you are looking for an moderate hike , you can do cholla trail . i do agree that it is easier 1.5 hike , but it 's can bet tricky . you need to pay attention to where you are going of you can easily loose the trail . some areas are super narrow and steep . regardless of what trail you choose , make sure you take some fruit , trail mix or protein bar ( these are just suggestions ) and enjoy when you get to the top while enjoying the view ! happy hiking !
1	the people home depot employs can be a real benefit at times . my water heater died on a weekend and i did n't have much money for a contractor to replace . i just walked into home depot to get an idea of my options and the employee who helped me actually installs these things ! we negotiated a real inexpensive contract , i bought the water heater from home depot and left it with the employee . he came over that night and installed it , hauled away the old and came back the next day to finish soldering ( since he did n't have those tools before . ) a little risky to leave the water heater with the employee which is why i asked him to bring it over that night ( god forbid it was stolen out of his truck overnight , bad for both of us ! ) i figured him staying employed at home depot was a good incentive to do right . now not all home depots might have an expert you need but it never hurts to ask around .
0	if it was possible i 'd give them half a star .. just because my ice vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk tasted ok and my friend 's taro tapioca drink was ok. where do i begin , there are soo many negatives that i can write a whole page about this place . first of all , they were rude when taking our order . we waved at 3 waiters and each one told us to wait a minute . finally , a girl w/ glasses comes over and takes our order but in the middle of it she runs into the kitchen and does not come back until about a minute later . rude ! ! there are pictures of the food on the wall w/ # s next to them . you would think that it corresponds to the # on the menu but nope .. its not even numbered the same as the menu . do not order watermelon tapioca ! the picture on the wall look like the typical watermelon juice drink one would find at any tapioca drink place . it should be red ... the ones that we got came out looking like blended pepto bismo ! ! ! ! it was pink ... of course we complained and said it does n't look like anything like that picture . one guy comes over and said oh its because we use a powder ! so we refused the drink ! we ordered ( 2 ) # 19 which was like pho tai w/ flanks . one came out and i was still waiting for mine , so finally we got someone 's attention and told him we 're still missing another one of this ( pointing at the first # 19 we got ) . they guy was like whats that , so i said # 19 , omg -- they go and open the menu to see what it is and then goes to take the one that we have away . we were like no what are you doing ! we ordered 2 of this , leave this one and bring another . i swear there are a bunch of morons working in this place ! ! ! ! strongly advise people to stay away ! ! ! the food is not even good ! ! ! ! worst pho ever ! ! ! ! ! paying at the cashier you can feel how sticky the floor was ! ! !
1	wow , what a great restaurant ! the service was excellent . they heard my husband had to go on a conference call and escorted us to a quiet end of the restaurant . our server was friendly and very attentive without being intrusive . i am gluten allergic and they had options and substitutions readily available . i had the turkey egg white omelette , which was very tasty , healthy , and filling . hubby had delicious chicken sausage with hash browns and eggs and the berry pancake , all of which he loved
0	i met some friends here on a thursday night . before i went into the restaurant , i noticed only 3 people at the bar . it was around 6:30 so i thought there would be more people as i thought happy hour was until 7pm . we were greeted at the door by jake , who would also be our server . i have to say he was great . he was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to our table . albeit it was not people plentiful . i ordered a pama-tini , pomegranite martini with a splash of cranberry . this drink was very good . i did like that most meals were available in half portions . i ordered the chicken medicini . presentation was nice but the meal was just okay . one of my friends order the pepperoni flat bread pizza . she said it was very good . my other friend ordered the half portion salmon . jake suggested the grilled veggies . again , presentation was nice but the salmon piece was about 1 inch wide by 3 inches long . my friend made no comment about the dish but i thought the portion was too small . i do n't think i would return here except for happy hour to get the pama-martini ( not sure if it is included though ) . three stars solely for our server , jake .
1	i eat lunch here at least once a week . the staff is always friendly and the food is always great . i have not been able to find a better value than their lunch special .
1	this is the 3nd time we 've been & we 'll deff be back ! my son . & i have such a fun day i was a good sport and joined him , this place is cool for a few reasons 1. it makes him super tired 2. it makes him real happy & lots of other kids to play with 3. massage chairs are actually worth the $ and time ahhh i played on my phone & got a quick rub down . it was the bomb.com
1	we were planning on replacing our heat pump this year but a mid-summer air conditioning failure moved it up on our priority list . as snowbirds we had anticipated waiting until we were in az for the winter but tyler and michael were so easy to deal with that we did most of the up-front work via e-mail and phone . tyler was very patient with my evolving requirements and never ending questions . the day came a week ago and the crew arrived on time and ready to work . despite a few unforeseen challenges , including having to relocate the new water heater as it would n't fit in the original space , the job was done professionally , on time , and on budget . we even had them replace our toilets with great new toto units ! i would highly recommend than to anyone needing repair or replacement of plumbing or hvac . their work is great and their prices are reasonable .
1	it 's chipotle . it fulfills a need -- satisfying my cravings for psuedo-mexican food . i do actually think their guac is really good , and the unique char on the chicken is what keeps me coming back . of course there are better choices for mexican , but how can you deny that specific craving ?
1	excellent lunch buffet . they offer both meat and vegetarian options for the buffet . large dinning area with plenty of space .
0	good atmosphere . but the food was nothing special , especially considering the price .
1	my brother has been a regular lunchtime customer at saigon nites for a while now ... but for whatever reason , i did n't get my ass over there to try it until last night . now i 'm kicking myself - it was better than i imagined ! zack and i met a few friends for dinner and although the restaurant was pretty quiet on a saturday night , i almost felt like we walked into a friend 's house ... the whole family was there ! menh ho and hien le ( the couple that owns it ) were extremely welcoming and friendly ... their 2 kids were there as well and so were the grandparents ! ( the kids are so cute by the way ! ) but i digress ... the menu was much larger than i expected . my last experience with vietnamese food was years ago in atlanta and i remember a limited menu . not at saigon nites ! it was hard to decide what to order since everything sounded delectable . we ended up sharing an order of the eggplant in garlic sauce for the table ... well , that was the intention but i thought it was heavenly and probably at the majority of it ! i sampled zack 's pho ( which he orders with extra veggies ) and was secretly wishing i 'd ordered my own ... but my vermicelli noodle entree with shrimp and veggies was pretty damn tasty too . i think the sweet fish sauce served with it totally makes the dish . do as zack instructed me - just pour it all on and enjoy ! our friends seemed to enjoy the vietnamese curry , pho , and a dish that looked to me like pad thai . we watched another table enjoy the rice crepe ( banh xeo ) and all of us had some order envy with that one ; i 'll have to remember for next time . and there will be a next time sooner rather than later as saigon nites is going to be thrown in the mix of regulars for me . go support this family run business - especially if you like ethnic food and a casual atmosphere ... and it 's cheap too ! $ 10 - $ 15 a person max out the door !
1	a live confession of me reviewing this church ? : ) this church is located on the strip , good for out of towners looking to share their thoughts with god when traveling . i should begin that i confess that i make my way to come to this particular church during lent/holy week/easter/christmas . its a very large church so it usually can seat everyone attending mass on easter or christmas , it is beautifully decorated and they have daily mass at various times throughout the day . it is actually posted out in the front of the church . keep in mind that this is not a parish . i have had several different priests that lead mass , and most of them leave you with things to think about of why you are there to attend mass . but i did experience one priest here that chops the regular one hour mass to 30 minutes , i mean he speeds through mass . we were late to midnight mass for christmas ( i know bad .. ) about 15 minutes , and they were already doing eucharist and then about 10 minutes later , mass ended . so we came back in the morning because we felt we missed out ! that was funny to me , but something i wanted to share with my fellow worshipers . peace be with you all .
0	this bar had three dollar signs on yelp and i think that is appropriate . it is pricey . there are different packages available to pay for . the option worth the lowest cost gives you use of a parka and boots . the next option up adds two drinks with your parka and boot rental . there are more options that give you a souvenir hat and fancy parka . these options are all over $ 50 . after you select the option , you have to store your cameras and phones inside a locker . then , you get dressed up with the proper cold weather gear and get escorted into the ice bar . when i walked into the ice bar , i was surprised at how small it was . there are only a few seating areas and one small bar . since i selected the option with the two drinks , i tried two of the specialty cocktails . the drinks were tasty and served in ice cups . we only stayed for an hour because we got too cold . the parkas helped , but it 's not enough to keep you warm for a long time . overall , this was a really cool experience . i 'm glad i tried it out , even if it was a bit pricey .
0	not too sure how it works out that the man 2 orders behind me is already enjoying his bagel and coffee , while i 'm sitting here waiting like an idiot . i showed the idiot cashier my coupon and she didnt seem to honor it . no biggie , just didnt really feel like blowing $ 11.50 on two bagels . in the long run , coupons do help . especially after today , i find it odd that the manager was standing right behind her didnt bother to step in . i 'm probably better off going to albertsons down the way , to get 3 packs of bagels for the price of two bagels . probably wo n't be coming here again especially to wait 10 minutes for 2 bagels . yikes .
0	well i must have chosen the worst dish that day . how sad , this place has a wonderful set of authentic tiwanese items . i ordered the spicy wonton ( which strangely had `` ma la '' sause/oil poured on top of it . now i am a sucker for mala so i did like the dish even though the pork and shrim inside was rather bland ( me thinks an addition of some garlic/leek or ginger might do the trick ) . also ordered the taro boba ( without ice ) which was fine , a tad on the sweet side for my taste but to each his/her own . the hainan chicken was however just horrible . the chicken was definitely semi rancid and both the rice and chicken were soaking in oil . i was hoping the ginger , garlic , onion sauce would redeem this but sadly that too was dissapointing . an extra star for the potential . i hope to go back and order a more safer choice and hopefully redeem my impression of this high potential joint .
1	perfect place to soak up all the tequila from the night before that i should n't have had . omelette was delish , biscuits were redonk . minus one star for slow ( though good ) service . asked multiple times for water refills ( essential ! ) but did n't get it . no worries though , i 'll be back my next trip to vegas ! !
1	good experience here . super clean , rooms are updated with newer furnishings , etc . even though the property follows the old embassy suites atrium model . my only complaint about the rooms was that lighting was lacking . the entire front room had a small desk lamp with a tiny skinny bulb and a table lamp as the only illumination , and the bedroom only a desk lamp and the light beside the door . if you could n't have the window shades open , you could n't see well enough to do anything . typical free happy hour , but in a nice dedicated bar area with some decent snacks , and a good breakfast set up - more seating and more accommodation for made to order items that most es 's . staff everywhere i encountered were super friendly and efficient . i got my company 's rate here , which made it a great bargain for vegas . bonus : elvis and priscilla ( the swans ) and beautiful koi were very nice ambiance for the hotel .
1	was in vegas again , ate there 3 times , of course had the raw clams , tried alaskan chowder , pan roast , and gumbo , gumbo was good , chowder and roast awesome , going to try the linguine and clams next time . all 3 bowls were totally empty when i was done .
0	the food arrived quick . it took them no time at all to pull the bolognese sauce out of the can . the only thing good about the restaurant is the location . but it does not make up for the meals . not going back .
0	just a update of my observations and experiences with duke energy .when we moved into our house because , of the beautiful trees it was very dark in the evening even after i installed solar lights along the driveway and front porch they just did not put out enough light . so i called duke energy and spoke with them about outdoor lighting . they said the install was free and it would be x number of dollars a month i thought that was a fair amount so 2 lights where installed . all went well until about 4 weeks later both lights went out ? i called and requested a service call thinking it was the bulbs it did seem strange that both went out at the same time . around a week later i called duke and asked when where they coming out to repair these lights ? after going threw 3 people or more i was told that the lights where turned off ? i asked why ? i was told that my power was scheduled for disconnect the next day ? i asked why they said that someone ? had called and said they where moving ? i said oh really ? i just moved here less than 6 month ago ! to make a long story short it seemed that there was a road by the same name close by and the addresses where confused ? i said you have 3 email addresses for me 3 phone numbers i was not called to insure this order was correct before disconnect and who verified my information on the disconnect order ? no one ! so ... lets just say they cut my power off no one was home except one of my elderly parents that may have to have some sort of machine the runs on electricity ? that could have killed them ! not to mention if i had left for vacation everything in the freezer would have been ruined and those beautiful expensive fish in the tank more than likely would be dead ! ! ! ! so when i told duke that i was never called nor was the disconnect order verified they told me '' they can not contact everyone its would take to much time ! ! ! '' then i asked `` is this ever done ? '' and was told well ... no . unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! ! and the monthly price on the outdoor lights has increased 3 times so i had them turned off ! ! ! i guess this is what happens when you have a monopoly ! ! !
0	akahana had won my heart when i found out they advertised buy one get one free sushi everyday - but then i took it back . in theory , the bogo deal seemed amazing but after a visit , i realized it was a big disappointment and honestly , pretty misleading . the sushi rolls are nearly double the price i pay at other locations . $ 12 for a typical roll with tuna , avocado , cucumber and a special sauce and it 's is mediocre in size ? yeah , i better be getting a second one ! the service was good and i thoroughly enjoyed the $ 2 martini specials . the curbside appeal was bleh since it 's located in a strip mall . however , the interior is nice but not spectacular . i do n't have a reason to return in the future but it was n't my worst sushi experience either .
1	to make a truly great restaurant you need great family recipes , food with big bold taste and items that you can find no were else . the sunset cafe has all that plus much more . the interior is beautiful and well thought out . the staff will make you feel comfortable and pampered . you must try the grilled shrimp . the one pound tamales are a real show stopper . easy to find and lots of parking . i am going back .
0	we were here on ky derby day and while the betting was fun the service bordered on discriminatory . we were walked by at least 7 times without being acknowledged that we were there at our table . this while the table beside us got service and backslaps every 5 minutes . we walked out . do not go here .
0	the home-brewed beers first became available this week and we enjoyed 4 on the first day . but by thursday and again on friday they only had two home brewed , one of which was the cider . so , a little disappointing that they ran out of home brewed so soon after they first became available . that having been said , the decor is nice and feels warm , and the sound is muffled enough that you can have a conversation without resorting to shouting . the beer selection is good . the wine offerings on the other hand are proudly displayed to be `` black box '' box wines , which i have never seen in any bar ... its not that box wine is bad , it just was so strange . my last complaint , and this probably cost them a star is that they offer almost nothing to eat . planters peanuts in a pouch and tiny sample bags of pretzels are the total menu . maybe one or two other non-perishable bar snacks would keep folks from feeling the need to leave to get dinner . can someone get this bar a slim jim or a pink hard boiled egg ?
1	this place is one of the best coffee shops in pittsburgh . it has an amazing atmosphere that is very welcoming , including a working fireplace to sit near on cold days . the coffee is as good or better than any corporate chain in the area , and definitely better than the beehive . if you have any reading or studying to be done , grab a table or a chair and relax . they also have wonderful desserts , a friendly staff , and keep a tidy place . summer features a nice ( though unfortunately placed right by a shitty building and a dumpster . ) porch area .
1	awesome veggie food ! well worth a taxi ride from the strip if you are vegetarian !
1	i am very grateful to this store as well as their staff . i have purchased from rac in the past , in pa , and they proved to help : my moving company screwed me and this rac saved the day ! since i had just moved here n had n't received my first pay check yet , this store called the store in pa that i had dealt with and set me up with my furniture based upon the pa stores recommendation . the furniture was delivered and set up the next day . my daughters bedroom set that we ordered was broken and so they delivered a `` loaner '' to get us through them finding her set without any issues . all of their furniture is quality as well as their appliances . i can not say enough about this store as well as this company . where else would have sold me furniture without pay stubs and a credit check ? their interest rates are insane- however , when your credit is low ( such as mine ) , you are going to pay more regardless of where you go or what you 're purchasing ( assuming that you 'll even get financed ) .
0	got a pepperoni half veggie . good amount of veggies barley any pepperoni , good cheese but dough and sauce definitely needs more season . i felt like i was eating just because it looked good and i was hungry . i do n't know if i want to go back and risk it .
1	this place is so much fun with an amazing atmosphere ! ! ! all of our food was delicious and the cocktails are amazing . a really cool twist on mexican food . definately recommend checking it out for a good time !
1	sir ed 's is a little hidden gem in park road shopping center that not nearly enough people know about . inside , the low ceiling and dark accents give this place a total irish pub feel . outside , the patio seating is a nice little quiet sanctuary . the menu here is very vegetarian friendly with lots of comfort food to choose from . sir ed 's has a large bar with lots of beers and and an adequate on tap selection . my favorite appetizer here is the irish potato cakes ( $ 6.50 ) . two large crusty cakes with a warm herb goat cheese sauce . delish ! i usually order the spicy asparagus & portabella grilled cheese ( $ 8.25 ) . this sammich is served on sourdough . it 's a nice change from your typical grilled cheese . the veggies inside are perfect , but i would n't exactly call them spicy . order comes with a side , i almost always get the french fries ... large `` steak fries '' with a strong potato flavor .
0	see my review for red lobster in tucson , last updated today , to see the contrast between how outback steakhouse and red lobster handles complaints .. i 'm still waiting for the outback manager to get back to me .
0	if i could rate this lower than 1 star , i would . they completely over charged me , and it was very obvious they did it too . do not go here .
1	it 's always crackin at pho kim long everytime i come here ! usually it 's when i 'm drunk/after clubs/morning after lol and it never disappoints . of course pho is the to-go meal for when you 're hungover from the shenanigans of vegas night life , so that will explain the herds of people who are always at this place . the food itself is bomb . the pho is always good to have , hot and with all the right flavors to cure your bod . the bun bo hue is also not bad . egg rolls , of course . ca n't say much for other foods that are non-soup because i have never tried them . but the pho , you ca n't go wrong .
1	# 12 beach club is great ! i cant believe i love a sandwich with cucumbers on it ! ? ! its a turkey sandwich with cheese and avocado spread , the bread is fresh and the combination of flavors make this sandwich so great . service is good here , and the place looks pretty new and clean inside . my daughter lives nearby so i hit this place up now every time i go to visit her which seems to be often since she is always in the need of money , furniture , food ( i could go on ... )
1	excellent customer service , very clean !
0	if i could put zero stars i would . the pizza looked soooo good but once i took a bite is was the most discusting thing i have ever eaten , the cheese slipped off and i felt the crust that was under the pizza and it was so so so soggy like it was a few days old , then there was a strange film type substance under the cheese . needless to say i will never be eating at any villa pizza ever again , after i saw that gross pizza i kept thinking about it and felt sick and wanted to vomit !
1	i 'll start off by saying it .. i miss the dive ! i liked going to the dive before it was fashionable to go to a dive . the dive was our reason to come here as kids . for those of you who think i am just rambling on like a lunatic about a submarine , just look up the old dive restaurant to see what i mean . that 's vegas at it 's finest . alas , i am all grow 'd up .. or so my i.d . says so anyways .. and the girlfriend wanted to spend some of my hard earn cash and so we opted to walk here from our visit to circus circus . the fashion show mall is not quite like all the other more central strip based malls . the prices are n't meant to gouge you . you wo n't feel like you 're doing the walk of shame after you stroll on out of it 's air conditioned confines . they have a store for everyone , and some for the other people too . they 're not bargin bin , outlet prices .. but they are not forum shops prices either . the smart bet for shopping in vegas .
1	love this spot . one of my recommendations when people come to vegas . either caps or earls . done . get the tuna and iced lemonade ...
0	initially , i was excited to go as the hash house in san diego is great . yeay : large portions , fresh and good quality ingredients . i had the corned beef hash . hubby 's total rewards card served as a speed pass , so we only waited 10 min when the regular wait was an hour . meh : slooow service ( took 30 minutes for food to arrive ) , the vanilla waffle was more like a pancake shaped into a waffle -- very cakey and almost soggy , i was expecting something crisp and airy
0	forgive this post . it 's late , and i 'm a bit rusty . last week , a coworker and i went to the common market for sandwiches . hailing , most recently , from chicago and , before that , savannah , ga , i 've experienced some awesome healthy-minded grocery stores . cm was right on par with some of my favorite markets elsewhere . the food was great . i ordered the club sandwich , which was not only made awesome , but was also reasonably priced . the shop itself , as previously stated , reminded me a lot of some of my other favorite markets of the same genre . and , being that i 'm not quite the fan of charlotte yet , it was nice to experience a place , in the city , that brought me back . as for the staff , they were quick , friendly , and efficient . my only complaint was that i had to ask for a bag at the counter , to carry my lunch out . overall , i 'd say cm is a place i 'm glad i found in charlotte . personally , it brings back some good memories of places i 've loved , and they have great sandwiches . fin .
0	i ended up going to this restaurant after finding that timo 's was closed . the food is great for what it is . it is set up like a cross between a cafeteria and a diner ..... not my usual choice for eating . when you walk in your hearded down a narrow walk where you are lead to a register . you order your food and get your utensils , drinks , condements , napkins , .... pretty much everything yourself . i '' m a restaurant snob so they lost points for that but it may not be a concern for you . the food was good , nothing to write home about . service was friendly and polite . if you are going to be meeting people , do n't pick this restaurant . there is no where to wait for people , not even a bench out side and you ca n't sit until you order .
1	the one thing about charlotte that i miss . i loved our waitress who always knew me and my boyfriend were pulling up . she would have our favorite booth cleared off and our mountain dews ready for us . my absolute favorite things to order during the late night menu was the pita burger and breakfast ( yes breakfast after midnight ! ) it 's a bit quiet during the late night which is expected among most 24/7 diners . i also had the dinner menu before and it was just as lovely . if you want friendly faces and great food that is better then mcdonalds when your drunk at 2am , go here !
1	beautiful environment , great therapeutic massage , wonderful customer service ... i highly recommend elements .
0	solid 3 stars . friendly staff and fun entertainment . be warned : the wait is long ... like 20 min avg wait long . we had 4 guest in front of us and our wait took about 25 min . the ice cream is nothing exciting to me . in fact , i thought it was n't very sweet ( which is good ) and that the ice cream lacked richness . we got the green tea ice cream mixed with strawberries and mochi . i do enjoyed the freshness of all the ingredients but there is n't anything that stands out . while you wait , might i recommend grabbing a table if you can and sit facing the walkway . the casino and restaurant nearby draws the most interesting crowd . it was so fun watching the people dressed up in their hot gears wandering around . that made the wait worthwhile in itself for me !
0	i live within a half mile of this yoga studio and decided to try a few sessions out with my aunt . we both purchased $ 40 groupons for ten hot yoga sessions at this location . on 11/11/14 , we went in to sign up and get started but were treated with absolute disrespect by the man working behind the counter . i could n't get my groupon voucher to cooperate on my phone and he stood there peering over my shoulder and treating me like i probably did n't have the groupon . he asked me if i had been there before and i said yes , it has been over 3 years and before i could even finish my sentence he cut me off and said `` groupons are for new customers only , it says so in the fine print ! '' i was taken aback by his snappiness and it showed on my face . he looked at me and said `` wow '' in the most scrutinizing and arrogant tone . wow , talk about an unwelcome feeling ! i knew immediately i did n't care what that bikram yoga studio had to offer because i would not dedicate my business to an establishment that could make a person feel so unwelcome . they must have enough money that they do n't need any more business at all ! i walked out and went right home to have my groupon refunded immediately . apparently , they told my aunt that if i would have come back they could have used my groupon towards a package but since i felt the environment was so hostile , i had no desire to spend any more money there . that gentleman should really work on his customer service skills and how to communicate with people because he turned down two customers yesterday . we both had our groupons refunded and will never recommend this place to anyone . we are going to check out trufusion yoga next week !
1	al at banner plus is a five star operation and very cost effective . i had two signs made for our church and it took very little time for him to complete and finish the job . the signs came out perfect . gret work al ! !
0	i just stayed at the luxor and i will not be returning . when i checked in , they told me the only rooms they had left were on the 5th floor . i was fine with that until later that night . my hotel room was backed up to the lax nightclub that is located right inside the luxor . you hear the music like you are there in the club . you can feel the base of the music as well . i had to put the tv on to help drown out the music and which the tv did n't get turned off until after 4am when the music was over with . as you can tell , no sleep was taken it . i will not be coming back to this hotel again .
1	the 4 stars is for the 32 oz . porterhouse we ordered that was cooked to perfection ! when you make a reservation , you expect to be seated close to the time of your reservation . i did n't expect to be waiting another 30 minutes to be seated , i never even had to wait longer than 10 minutes at the craft restaurants in nyc ! we also got a 10pm reservation so when we were finally seated at our table , it was officially closing time for the restaurant . i will say that we at no point felt rushed to finish our meal ... it was only at the end of our lv craftsteak experience that i felt like we were holding up the staff from going home . some items on the menu may change each night so do n't be too surprised if you dont see something on the menu you `` thought '' you saw the day before . if you are a type of person who likes to know about the origin or history of something , you 'll find the drinks menu an interesting read . the lobster bisque had a wonderful flavour with huge chunks of lobster . well worth the price . we also got the prosciutto appertizer that had a super tasty fig jam accompany it . for our mains , we shared the 32 oz . dry-aged porterhouse . this was cooked exactly to our specification . the meat practically melted in your mouth ! the sides were ok i guess ... we ordered the mushroom risotto and the jeruselum artichokes . nothing to rave about there . the sides are a little overpriced but the porterhouse was well worth it ( even compared to other steakhouses in vegas ) . dessert for us was the pear sorbet ... hmmmm ..... i 've never had pear sorbet that actually had the texture of a pear . delish ! ! ok , so things have been going pretty well for now , minus the 30 minute wait at the beginning of the evening . when we finally get the check , here 's where the rudeness comes in . while hubby was reviewing the check , the waiter literally came over and snatched the signed credit card receipt from his hands ( `` i 'll take that ! '' he says ) . wtf ? ? so , i get that it 's late and that the staff want to go home ... but hell , we 've paid a lot of money to eat here and it was n't our fault that they took a 10pm reservation and only seated us at 10:30pm with a 10:30pm closing time . the moral of this review is , do n't get a reservation past 9:30pm . the food is great but the help gets cranky past their bedtime .
0	gotham bagels , in my opinion , has some of the best bagels in madison . however , they are pricey , to the point that i think they are overpriced for what it is ... a bagel . their breakfast sandwiches are really good . i have never tried their cream cheese because i 'm not a fan , so i can ' t comment on that . i always call ahead because it can take longer than i am willing to wait if you just walk in and order .
0	i would give tao zero stars except it deserves credit for being a really cool looking place . the food is mediocre , insanely salty , and totally overpriced . the sushi is not on par with any good sushi restaurant in la or vegas , and the rest of the menu is like katana 's . the service is horrendous and the attitude is a joke .
0	i would like to be excited about a new lunch option in the oakland area , and at least on the surface this is a great new addition . however , i 'm not impressed with the value for money ( high prices , ) and the menu has some strange choices ( i understand it is the bagel factory but why am i forced to get a plain bagel with a soup ? ) on the plus side , service is n't too slow and the ambiance is pretty cool ( industrial decor with sliding garage doors . )
1	food- great . service- great . live music- amazing ! we attended brunch this past sunday for the first time . everything was great from the food to the beverages . what made this brunch special was the live musician they had . the young man had a very john mayer-ish vibe and the volume was perfect . hope to be back soon to enjoy the whole experience !
0	average vegas buffet . great variety . food is great . no complaints . the reason i give average is because it 's on par with many of the other vegas buffets we have been to and a bit over priced . we came about 930am during the new years holiday . we paid about $ 40 per person . that 's too much to pay for breakfast but not many other choices in the wynn hotel for breakfast .
1	there are very few places that i 'm completely ok with waiting thirty to forty-five minutes to eat breakfast , much less in the phoenix heat , but when it comes to matt 's big breakfast i do n't think twice about it . it 's actually a regular occurrence , while sitting on the outdoor waiting benches , for the guests who are leaving to assure you it is worth the wait . the place is small , you might even say cramped depending on where you are sat , but the food is second to none . i always get the special , which varies from day to day . it 's typically a scrambler with generous helpings of meat and cheese , and some locally grown veggies or peppers . i recommend a side of home fries with rosemary as opposed to the hash browns . if you 're not in the mood for eggs try the waffle or pancakes ( seriously it 's just all good ) , and if bread does n't come with what you order you 've got to try the sourdough toast with house made organic blueberry jelly ... so delicious . in addition to the amazing food , the service is always great . hands down , matt 's big breakfast is my favorite breakfast stop .
0	accessible directement \u00e0 partir du m\u00e9tro atwater , ce centre commercial voisin de l'ancien forum a cela de pratique que les usagers du m\u00e9tro comme moi peuvent acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des grandes surface comme zellers ou canadian tire sans devoir faire de d\u00e9tour . aussi , la place alexis nihon comprends une tour \u00e0 bureaux et une tour \u00e0 appartements locatifs . on y trouve la plupart des boutiques qu'on est habitu\u00e9 de voir dans les centres commerciaux . en fait , ce dernier se d\u00e9marque surtout par son acc\u00e8s au m\u00e9tro et sa r\u00e9partition sur plusieurs \u00e9tages . bref , c'est un centre commercial tout ce qu'il a de plus habituel , mais qui est tr\u00e8s utile pour ceux qui passent de toute fa\u00e7on pour la station atwater pour revenir du travail .
1	this place used to be one of my favorite places to go . all the food is authentic chinese made cooked by chinese . the portions are more than generous with good prices . visit this place you wo n't be disappointed ..
1	authentic mexican with regional signature plates . over 100 tequilas as well . the food is exceptional quality with organic , gmo-free , and consideration of dietary restrictions/choices like vegan and gluten free . may i suggest the pulled chicken tacos or burrito or the signature plate pork mole verde . i tasted the best sipping tequila i have ever had in us or mexico . it was so nice to eat great food served up by super friendly servers and find a restaurant in las vegas that has a conscience . support this movement , and if you do n't care where your food comes from or the impact it has on our planet getting to our over full mouths , then go here anyway ... the food is outstanding ! ! !
0	the only reason i 'm giving two stars and not one is because it is a really nice gym . lots of amenities ie cafe , salon , classes . but here are the problems : 1 ) they charge way too much ! i pay $ 55 a month whereas any other gym i 've been a part of is $ 30 or less 2 ) the staff sucks ! personal trainers are super fake and stuck up . the coordinators or whatever you call them are also very fake and pushy salespeople . i tried to cancel my membership and they incented me by saying they would give me $ 150 lt bucks to use but then i never actually received them ! 3 ) this place is always crowded . and most of the members are not friendly or polite and will run you down in the hall like you do n't even exist ! 4 ) you know those commercials for planet fitness where the guy is shoving his abs in everyone 's face ? yeah , a lot of those types of people come here too if you are looking for a super expensive , fancy gym and you have a tight tone body and like to stick your nose in the air , this place is for you ! if you are like me and trying to get in shape or maintain your workout regimen and want an easy going no pressure atmosphere , steer clear of lifetime
0	i 've been here quite a few times in the past and i am never been made welcome . after today i refuse to go back . the owner was working . when we walked in there was no greeting . mind you there was only one more customer in the shop being helped . when we had questions she seemed bothered , and very unhelpful . clearly she did not need our business . i would not waste my time going to this shop with such awful customer service . there are others in az to visit that are warm and welcoming ! zoe and her trunk lost out buisness !
0	i 've been to this ihop many many times with pretty good service . the most recent visit ( tonight ) literally left a bad taste in my mouth . it started with a less than attentive waitress , progressed to a dirty teaspoon , and ended with batter-filled undercooked pancakes ( that arrived about 10 minutes after the other part of my meal ) . i asked for a manager . the woman who came over asked the problem , i told her and asked her to comp the pancakes . ( they were part of the double blueberry pancake combo . ) she apologized several times then left the table . when our waitress brought the bill , she said the manager had taken $ 5 off the bill . we were comped our drinks ( one cup of hot tea and the all-you-can-drink soda ) . i was n't aware those two drinks were $ 5 , but okay ... kudos to the seasoned waitress , iris , who tried her best to rectify our situation . actually i happen to be a french toast fan but c'mon ihop ! if you ca n't do pancakes , well , what can ya do ?
1	had a networking meeting/dinner here tonight . very , very good food . the flank steak and especially the lamb were delicious . i enjoyed the salad and the service was solid .
0	i stayed here during a business trip ... older crowd and a little quiet but it was nice that i could play any game i wanted without a wait . i learned how to play three card poker and i made $ 350.00 .
1	i started going to simi 's just a couple of months ago , but i 've already taken several people there for lunch who are also sold on this place . diane is all about giving great service and assuring that you enjoy your meal . and the food is very good and very fresh . she remembers me by name and my order every time and makes me feel at home . highly recommended !
1	we stayed here on our recent trip to las vegas as my friend has a time share here . the hotel was nice , right behind the flamingo , so pretty much still on the strip ( in comparison to the other hilton which is waaaay down there ) . the suite was spacious . good sized kitchen , fully stocked , washer/dryer , 2 closets , pull out couch , dining area , bed room was good size , comfy bed , super comfy pillows . mirrors everywhere , so all us girls could get ready . large jacuzzi , large vanity . tiny shower though . the shower was our biggest issue , the little rubber stopper on the bottom did n't stop any water from leaving the shower , so by the time anyone got out , the floor was soaked , all of our towels were used up cleaning up all the water . it was a mess . although , we did call and ask for additional towels , blankets , sheets and pillows , and the security guard brought them up right away and was so friendly . all in all , a good stay . we did n't have them clean the room on saturday , but on sunday we called , and they said we missed our chance ? ? that was odd . the valets/bellmen were always very nice and very courteous . although some of them kept trying to make us take town cars instead of taxis , and lying to us about how much it 'd cost . some guy tried to tell me itd cost over 40 for 2 taxis to the wynn . dude , its like , right there . it cost less than 13/taxi . that was the only part i did n't appreciate , because you can tell the staff had some kind of relationship with the town cars . i would definitely stay here again
1	another heavenly breakfast place . busy as hell on a sunday . : ) everyone was quite satisfied . heaping portions of heavenly deliciousness . their potatoes are seasoned with paprika and something else i ca n't place , it makes them quite friggin tasty . i wanted to pick off everyone 's plate ! ! i ordered the omelet with mashed potatoes in the middle and cheese . top that with banana bread . i ate like i was feeding twins in my belly ( i 'm not ) . completely egg-gasmic . i 'd do it over and over again if i could .
0	americanized . everything is very sweet . ordered the pad see-ew , tom yum soup , and the beef salad . decent price , although i have to compliment their interior . very modern and clean .
0	the meal was extremely simple , underwhelming , and had no `` pizzazz '' . it was my friends birthday , so i figured i would treat him , his girl , and myself to an awesome lunch . i had never been here before , but have only herd good things . as soon as we walked in , we were rudely greeted by the one out of two hostesses that were at the host stand . no smile , no energy , no welcoming `` thanks for joining us at our restaurant by spending your hard earned money and keeping me in the job '' vibe , nothing . crazy , in my opinion , we should have left , but did n't because the plans to eat here were already in affect . we were seated promptly , and had a nice view of their wine room that is encased in glass . pretty cool . our server was very friendly , and had just started there a few months prior . she gave us some recommendations , and we followed through with them . for my appetizer i ordered the `` grilled octopus '' ( refer to pic ) ( $ 10 additional fee ) . the octopus was charcoal-broiled perfectly , and was good . maybe i like more `` eclectic '' food , but this was just so simple . the octopus was accompanied by red onions and capers with the plate being drizzled with oil . nothing amazing , just good . we also ordered the `` milos special '' , which was lightly fried zucchini and eggplant w/ tzatziki & kefalograviers cheese . this , center shared appetizer , was delicious ! the zucchini and eggplant were fried perfectly . the yogurt sauce , that was inside the stack of fried veggies , added such a nice tang , that really balanced all of flavors flawlessly and made all of us go back for more . the birthday boy ordered the `` crab cake '' ( refer to pic ) ( $ 10 additional fee ) appetizer . from what i tried , the cake was okay ... just very simple , small , and had nothing special going on . the b-day boy regretted ordering it . for my lunch entree i ordered the servers recommendation , the `` lavraki '' ( refer to pic ) . this mediterranean bass is a `` specialty at milos '' . after finding three ( 3 ) pin bones in my fish , i figured it was n't as `` special '' as the server mentioned . the fish was cooked well , but once again ... nothing special . when you are eating at such an upscale restaurant , you expect amazing flavors , quality , service , and atmosphere . it was blowing my mind that there was such a simplistic approach with no added spark , and still errors and missteps . my friend ordered the `` nova scotia deep sea lobster pasta '' ( refer to pic ) ( $ 15 additional fee ) , which he thought was an absolute , complete joke . the pasta was tossed in a red , tomato sauce and was accompanied by the top and bottom half of the lobster , while the middle of the lobster was the pasta . it was absurd . the pasta came out lukewarm , and he did n't want to inconvenience anyone , so he did n't want to complain . i thought the pasta had some good flavors , but the presentation was ... just a hot mess . for dessert i had the server order for me . she brought out a `` yogurt martini '' ( refer to pic ) which was tangy , tart , and good for what it was .. greek yogurt inside of a martini glass . the b-day boy ordered the `` walnut cake w/ kaimaki ice cream '' ( refer to pic ) which we thought was moist , and delicious . i was envious of his dessert . no candle was given , or even a `` happy birthday '' but that 's understandable . all the other standards of food quality , service standards , etc .. were disappointing . overall , the meal was a bust . we left not satisfied and extremely underwhelmed for my friends birthday . we will not return .
0	i try really hard to be patient and polite when food places fu @ ! up my order to avoid a juicy loogie in my sandwich or my bun being used to mop the floor . but how is it possible for a sandwich shop to make sandwiches wrong every time ? why give people the option of mayo or mustard , choice of bread , lettuce , tomato , onions , sprouts , choice of cheese when they dont give you what you ask for . is it only when they feel like it ? after the 5th or 6th time of screwing up , my anger turned into a humorous game . kind of like those highlight books you had as a kid . the `` whats missing ? '' game . a picture of a horse with no leg or bicycle with no tires . thats what comes to mind when i hear someone mention `` heidi 's deli '' i ordered the usual turkey sandwich on rye bread and got a tuna fish sandwich . at least they got the mayo right even though its mixed in with the tuna . i personally went to heidi 's to see what idiot makes my sandwich . just curious ... maybe if i personally go up there , its a lesser chance to fu @ * up my sandwich . a polite woman with somewhat broken english takes my order . she already starts off wrong by giving me the wrong bread . she apologizes and asks me `` what kind of bread was it again ? '' rrrrrrrrggghhh ... while making my sandwich , a police man comes in and she starts making small talk . shouldnt you be focusing on making my sandwich ? i couldnt see everything she was doing because the counter is so high . in the end , after driving to the park with my sandwich in my hand , no cheese , no pickle and no onions . no offense , but heidi must be blonde .
0	t 's cousin had her wedding dinner here in a private room . how could i resist trying `` just a little '' of everything ? nothing exotic like alligator ... just the standard and all pretty damn yum . but , i do n't care how distracted by meat skewers you are . promise me , whatever you do , do n't miss the cheezy biscuits ! seriously , i must have had a dozen . i have no idea whether cheezy biscuits are brazilian or not and i do n't care . cheezy , cheezy , cheezy heaven . 3-1/2 cheezy stars . and , bonus points for the never empty glass of cabernet !
1	we went to celebrate our 5th anniversary , on a monday . arrived at 6 , and as expected for the area , the restaurant was empty ( devoid of customers ) , maybe someone in the bar area . wait staff were very friendly , in the `` look ! new people ! '' sort of way , and tried to be as helpful and friendly as could be . kinda a creepy vibe there , but they caught that , and toned it down a little . beware portion size ! the filet mignon is a 15oz . piece of beef . that being said , my wife ordered it , and offered me a bite , and i thought it was perfect . tender , juicy , and delicious . i ordered the seafood pasta dish , and everything came out nicely . half a small lobster , crab claw , scallions , and some of their fish ( i ca n't remember what it was ) , white wine sauce with garlic . dessert was their cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9 , which had a slight hint of orange . very tasty ! overall , the place is a 4 star for me , only because of the ala carte menu style . if they had some complete dishes , paired properly , it would have been much easier for us to decide . also , be aware that they do n't tell you about the `` fixed price '' menu off the website .
1	yummy ! ! i got the kimchee fried rice and the bulgogi flautas . both were very good . i 'd def come again . wish they had a location on the south side of town .
1	so the other day , i was starving at work and had no idea what to get for dinner . one of the girls was going out and had no idea what she was getting either . she was telling me that it was gon na be pizza or sandwiches . she was telling me that she was probably gon na get pizza from broadway pizzeria . i told her that i had never heard of the place but pizza did sound good . so we drove over to the pizza place and were debating whether or not to go in or get something else . i told her that i was debating about going to starbucks as well . well needless to say , we went into broadway pizzeria and each got a slice of pizza and chicken fingers . she ordered a slice of cheese pizza and original chicken fingers with ranch . i ordered a pepperoni slice with mild sauce on my chicken fingers and got ranch to go with it ... i loved it ... one of the other girls at work was telling me about the spaghetti from there as well ... omg .. i am gon na have to try that next . we were so happy to hear that deliver that we are making plans to order so from there and have it delivered . the pizza was kinda greasy , but it was fantasticly delicious . the chicken fingers were even better . thanks to friend , i found a new pizza place to order pizza from instead of pizza hut or dominos .
0	review probably only helpful for vegans/vegetarians i recently went there in desperation to find a quick bite to eat while on break from jury duty . i have dietary restrictions so i knew they may not be able to accommodate me ( no meat , dairy , eggs ) . they had a couple of options ; salads without cheese and veggie flatbread pizza with no cheese . good enough for me . i chose their veggie flatbread pizza , no cheese . it was good . was it worth the price ? no , however , i was so hungry and had limited time . the fact that they were able to accommodate me made me happy . the staff is friendly and helpful . i 'm sure if i was a meat/dairy eater i would frequent the place , but i ca n't say i 'll go there often due to the price of my only options . i will go there when i 'm in a bind again .
1	madison has a lot of lao/viet/thai places , but lets face it they mostly suck . at least that 's what i realized once i tried out ha long bay . they have an intimidatingly long menu that i have not begun to sample in my several trips but the pad thai and sesame chicken dishes i have had were both good if a little sweet . the vietnamese soup was pretty good . the best part for me has been the appetizers . every cheap chinese place has a crab rangoon or fried pot stickers on the menu but i have never had better rangoon-like fried items than at ha long bay . the dumplings were also quite tasty though recently they have been more greasy and poorly formed than they were when the place opened . the spring rolls were also excellent . also though it should not be a factor i have to give them props for replacing the 'cajun ' place that preceded it , that was one of the worst restaurants i have been to in madison and the current occupants of the location do it much more honor . btw , on one trip we were there a little late but our young waiter very obviously got baked in between bringing us courses . it did not improve his waiting skills and our order immediately got messed up but it was hilarious so i suppose he get a pass .
0	walmart is a walmart is a walmart . i do n't go unless i happen to be with someone else that needs to go ....
0	a tasty fusion restaurant and bar in the new town area of edinburgh . we were able to walk in without reservations on a friday night around 6:30 , and they were able to squeeze us in ( though with a warning we had to be done within 2 hours which was twice what it took us ) , so that was nice . the food portions were large -- both the sampler plate and my rice dish -- but i was n't quite sure what sort of flavor themes they were going for with them . though warned my entree was spicy it was just barely a tick above bland . on the other hand , they have an extensive cocktail and drink menu , and their daiquiris are quite drinkable ( even if served in a martini glass ) . service was on top of things . i would stop in again if the opportunity presented , and there was n't any other place that caught my eye .
0	restaurant week review ... so we have not eaten here for dinner previously so we can not comment on the rw menu and food vs the normal menu , however nothing we had would lure us back . atmosphere is nice and pleasant , however the open floor plan makes it a bit noisy . food seemed reasonably priced and portions were sufficient . service was excellent . food : for starters we had the soup , which had a good consistency but lacking . it was too sweet and not enough earthy flavors . the shrimp was decent but nothing special . for entrees we had the shepherd 's pie , which was was not thick enough , bland , and not even as good as the one you can get at costco . the crispy whitefish over dirty rice was tasty but lacking a nice sauce to help the overall dry consistency of the dish . someone else at the table had the pulled pork and said it was good but not great . the best part of our meals were the desserts , chocolate covered bacon s'mores and coconut cake . both would be worthy closers to a nice meal .
0	service dropped this from a 4-star all the way down to a generous 2-star review . the fajitas and fish tacos were average ( could use a bit of zest ) , however , the guacamole was delicious ... once we could actually eat it . it took multiple servers at least 15 minutes before one of them brought us chips ( we had to ask three different employees ) . imagine the torture ! it was a beautiful mountain of avocado , onions , cilantro , and lime juice in a stone bowl sitting right in front of us . besides being `` forgetful '' about the chips , we had to ask two different people for napkins and silverware and our drinks took over 10 minutes . i considered giving them the benefit of the doubt , but it was n't a packed house . on the contrary , it was 3pm and only a handful of parties on the patio . overall , the service left us feeling neglected . our server did n't come around to check on us and never asked how our entrees were ( which we could have used limes ) . side note , the salsa was great and you can make it hot to order . the patio is a sweet place to be . just be flexible to move your chair around your table as the sun sets on the ritz carlton . open seating , spacious , and in the center of it all ... nice ! if vida can greatly improve communication between the waitstaff and train their servers to be more attentive and friendly this place would be a 4-star due to the location , the price , and the atmosphere . the floors are cool looking , but beware if you arrive in tall heels , you may slip ... yes , yes i did .
1	dr. cat was amazing . she is a very passionate , caring , and all around excellent dentist . she 's the kind of person that you want working on your child 's teeth . she explained all procedures and her concerns regarding my 4-yr old 's teeth in detail . the front desk staff and dental hygienist that cleaned my daughters teeth were all very friendly and treated my daughter with compassion . even though we had a few big fillings to deal with and it was a little painful my little one said she go back because dr. cat was so nice to her and gave her toys . they give gifts to the little ones after having work done . we paid a little extra for light sedation & nitrous oxide but it was worth it . i 'll def bring my daughter back for her next check up .
0	they offer new customers a better rate then existing customers . we left after pointing out this was not showing customer appreciation . left 10 days before next billing period . no refund .
0	place is clean , people are nice and the food is ok ... clam chowder looked like jelly and potatoes were hard but no horrible . biggest gripe was the service is slow 20 minutes to wait for soup seems long .
0	after visiting tottie 's a few more times recently it seems at the owners/management is failing at quality control . less attention is paid to detail and the taste is losing its pizzazz . i really hope they reflect on internal quality so the restaurant does n't continue its downward trend .
0	scumbag move of the day goes to jimmy john 's store # 2311 ( 9985 s. eastern ave # 100 ) . ivica and i left the office to grab a couple sandwiches , where , there was a homeless teenage kid with a tiny dog standing outside under the overhang ( since it 's raining heavily today ) . kid was n't even asking for money ( granted there was a sign on his suitcase that said `` anything will help '' ) . well before i could buy the poor kid a sandwich , they had called henderson pd on him , which , if anyone knows these cops , they 'd probably arrest him and he 'd never see his dog again . fortunately , i do n't think they found him . bottom line - you 're a collection of low life scumbags and i 'll be damned if you ever get any of my ( or my companies ) business ever again .
0	if you read enough of my yelp reviews , you 'll notice that my second home is the crappiest dive i can find . pomeroy 's is no exception . i started coming here because my friends live within walking distance and is where they like to go . to be fair , i 've never actually gone there on my own ( without them ) so i cant say i really choose the place . the bartenders are very very quick to remember your name and your drink , even though by the end of the night i always forget their names . the selection of games ( shuffleboard , darts , pool , and arcades ) is very good and worth the entertainment factor in their own . you never know what kind of crowd will be there , but mostly it is not a good one . i 've had a lot of people try to start fights here , it 's just a seedy and unruly bunch . that all said , overall i think it 's an ok place to drink . it 's inexpensive and the bartenders are great , and when it 's all said and done , thats what matters the most about a bar .
0	not an ideal place for good food , nor is it an ideal place to watch a feature film - so why not slap em both together , charge a premium , and overfill the theaters with patrons - brilliant ! i will say that there is a possibility the movie we saw , dark knight rises which has been out for a while , may have been relegated to their `` on-the-way-out '' theater , but the accommodations were quite cramped . that said , the experience is pretty cool , and if you 've never been to a dinner theater , it 's a good time . i 'll also give a shout out to the staff . while paying for our food and drinks at the end of the movie , i accidentally dropped $ 40 in cash ( two $ 20 's ) onto the floor . it was dark , i did n't see , blah blah . i noticed the blunder on the way home , and after i cooled off from cussing my own name repeatedly , called cinebarre in a desperate hope that the waiter had a good heart . well to her , and the credit of all the staff , she did . she turned it in , and i was able to go back that night and pick it up . i was so grateful , i came back the next day and gave her a fat tip and a thank you note . it really was a nice feeling to know some people are still good in this world !
0	it just so happened that in one weekend i visit two `` best of vegas '' spots , the other being pho kim long . i did n't even do that on purpose . my honey likes pizza ! i ordered the chicken calzone . lately , i 've grown more and more in love with calzones . this calzone came out huge . the dough rose a lot , making it look like a two story calzone . it looked great , but did n't taste as great as it looked . i loved the guilt free cheese , but not really the taste of the chicken . i wish it had pepperoni instead . and the tomato slices are big . i would have preferred chunks . i got two meals out of this . although it was n't fantastic , it was n't worth throwing away . my fianc\u00e9e ordered the meat lovers stuffed pizza , which he regretted . you are able to get sauce on the top or the side , but there 's no pizza sauce inside . womp womp womp . maybe we ordered the wrong things . or maybe we had higher expectations . either way we left full . as a note , they have a discount practically every day . and it 's different everyday . one day it may be 25 % off for military and another for teachers . the day we came in you could receive a discount for wearing tie-dye or a peace sign in honor of woodstock . that 's a pretty cool incentive to get some pizza .
1	hands down the best bbq in vegas . i have been going there for years . they are always consistant with their dishes and their service . if you are craving bbq this is the spot . usually i get the beef ribs or the sirloin steak . most of the time i do n't finish and always take home for lunch the next day . portions are very big . still worth the trip from summerlin . be carefull the smell slaps you silly from the parking lot !
1	excellent drinks and food . service has always been friendly and professional . very comfortable atmosphere to eat and drink . i prefer to sit at the bar . if you sit at a table , your table might be right beside the next table . the drinks are some of the best in pittsburgh . they make their own simple syrups . brunch is fantastic . i love the bloody mary bar .
0	bread ? good ! cheese ? good ! i 'm usually not very picky when it comes to pizza , but rosati 's pizza was tastier than i expected . we ordered a thin crust 14 inch pizza with onions , pepperoni , and olives . it was rather yummy . we also ordered some chicken wings , which were also pretty good . we ordered over the phone and the delivery was fast . but ... our 14 '' pizza , 6 chicken wings ( with one cup of sauce ) , and a modest tip for the driver cost $ 30 . the pizza was good , but it was n't that good . at first , the pizza seems affordable , but each additional topping on the 14 '' cost $ 1.60 . we really would have been better off buying a frozen pizza from fresh & easy . in short , i recommend the pizza , but perhaps it would be better by the slice .
1	the pretzels are awesome ..... i went with a group of girls our service was great she was able to split our checks for us even though she did n't seem very excited about it . service was great , drinks were great and most of the food was great 1 girl complained about the kale salad she said it was n't her favorite but it was ok. no other complaints
1	my husband forced me to give this place a second chance and i 'm glad he did . this time he insisted on the deluxe pedi which was amazing ! tammy did an outstanding job and allowed this new mom to finally relax . my mani was done by a very nice lady but my nails were just so so . she did n't paint the tip of the nails and u can see the lack of color from the top . also , there was a decent amount of polish on my cuticles but in all fairness we came in just at closing . we thought they closed at 7 but it was really 5:30 and they kindly took us even though we offered to come back another day . on my next visit i 'll book with tammy and hope for the same great pedi .
1	had a great experience today with amber ! she advised us on what route would be best for my daughters hair type , and the results were amazing ! we have both been going to another salon that was over priced and the work was mediocre and not worth it ! amber has great style , experience and great prices . my daughters hair was damaged beyond belief and was a mixture of 5 different colors , following a few months of neglect . we left with silky brown locks and we could n't be more pleased . thanks bombshell ! ! ! !
0	we are currently very frustrated with these guys . i think they charge a little more than they should , but really the problem is that they did some damage to property ( melted an expensive outdoor vehicle tent ) . i called and left a voicemail and also left my husbands number in the voicemail . it has been five days since then . every time we call we go straight to a voicemail that wo n't let us leave a message . we are both fairly certain that rather than deal with the damage they have caused , they have chosen to block our numbers . we find this outrageous . we thought they would at least call us back , but obviously if they have n't called back after five days they are n't planning to . do not use these guys .
0	this place wo n't appeal to most foodies ( if any ) , but if you 're looking for very casual dining , unpretentious food that comes in generous portions served by unpretentious people , this is your place . these have to be some of the most down to earth , genuinely nice people around in the restaurant biz ! they 'd get 5 stars for that . this is my place for local pizza or a baked fish hoagie when i need a break from my own heat n ' serve cooking and need something on the cheap . nothing but cool vibes here . be sure to check out the photo of michael douglas while you 're there .
0	all i have to say is ...... 25 min in the drive-thru . ummm there were only 3 cars in front of me ...... ?
1	best prices you will find ! they staff is super fantastic and always willing to answer any questions you have ! i come here weekly for quest bars . $ 1.99 each and my favorites are cinnamon roll and apple pie . i also get dymatize elite vanilla in the 5lbs bottle monthly . they hand samples out at lvac pretty often so you can always try something out before you purchase !
1	best new mexican in arizona ... easily .
1	pretty damn good . have n't gotten around to trying their calzones yet , but their pizza has a good thin but chewy crust . wings are n't going to blow your skirt up ( i was wearing a skirt when i tried them , so i would know ) but they wo n't blow your skirt down either ( this , again , is based on my own research ) . the other thing that i love , having spent some time on the east coast , is just how jersey these guys are . they 're surly as hell , yet somehow endearing . embrace it .
0	everything we ate was delicious , but with all high end sushi places , be prepared to feel robbed of a filling meal and your money . we had the seared fluke , seared albacore roll and the citrus peel miso cod . the seared fluke was a white fish served sashimi style . it looked really plain when served , but the soy salt was what gave it an interesting flavor because the soy sauce flavor was super concentrated . the seared albacore roll which had spicy tuna , shrimp tempera and avocado , was also tasty . the miso cod was probably our favorite out of the three . the cod itself was pretty light , but it was prepared with the skin still on which gave it flavor and a nice chewy texture . food was really good and service was above par but portion-wise i 'll have to pass on coming back . granted , we should have ordered more food for three people but even if i had eaten those three dishes alone , i would have still been hungry . our bill came out to roughly $ 90 and i just ca n't see myself throwing down $ 90 again to still be hungry afterwards .
0	the decor for the restaurant is really nice . really like the keg on the side . the place has scores of televisions . the restaurant is a but dark but nice . mix match seating with living room chairs . some of the seating sit low . we ordered the devil eggs for appetizer and fish and chips . the deviled eggs just was to much over the top for my liking . they had bacon and cheese in the filling . i do like the concept of putting the filling into your egg . the fish and chips , hubby like the chips as long as they were warm . i have mixed feeling about them . love the ketchup ! ! ! ! the fish was really good along with the tartar sauce and mets vinegar . oh the peas , ate all of those they were really good . service what service ? ? ? yeah okay right maybe next time service will show up ......
0	i believe this location has closed and should be removed as a listing
1	one nice thing about living back in the las vegas area is knowing i have the best vet for my cat . dr. terry muratore is the most honest , compassionate vet that there is ! he has the same great staff that stay there ! why ? he 's that damn good ! terry 's son anthony works there as well . it 's a great feeling to support a family run business . terry 's honesty and integrity are an example for all to follow . today , i thought it was something major ! terry took me back to show me my cat 's x ray and explain everything to me ! in more than 35 years of dealing with vets , he is the only one to do so ! how many vets make you wait , then just tell you what is wrong ? how do you really know ? take your cat or dog to a vet you can trust ! they love your pets almost as much as you do ! it seems like they always have strays there to get adopted . do they have to do this ? no . it 's not a money thing where they try ripping you off . they have pride in what they do ! go to legacy if you want the best . if you try the rest , i wish you luck , you will need it !
0	by far the worse service ! the one in henderson is way better ! do n't get me wrong they do have great sushi it 's just their service was terrible . i went here 3 times just to give it another chance but i am not going here anymore . they even forgot to bring out our drinks so that 's when i had the last of it . the only good thing i can say about this place is they have a variety of rolls to pick from and if you like all you can eat they have it !
0	hey , if i had known that there would be portion control on everything , i would have gone to prime or any other restaurant on the strip . i was not impressed with anything at this restaurant , except the decor . the service was not there and the same for the food . for the price that i paid for a dinner , the basket of rolls should have been on the table . instead , you would get two tiny bread rolls , with `` cold butter . '' how can you spread cold butter ? anyway , the meal so so memorable that i ca n't even remember one thing that i enjoyed at this restaurant. ! i will not return for sure , but rest assure that other restaurants will get my business .
0	i came here after a recommendation that it was the it place for fries/poutine .. the service was slow , the fries were kind of cold and it did n't even taste that great , it was n't the worst place but i would n't go back here
0	went in for a pink/white fill & a pedi . prices are good but pedi was so-so & fill was awful . do not go here for your acrylics ! also , the place is a little dingy & run-down w/ kids of the technician in the shop which is not relaxing . i will not go back .
0	so i ordered some food for delivery via grubhub , as expected during dinner time the wait time was just about an hour . i ordered at about 7 and some time passed when 8:20 had rolled around . the food had n't arrived yet ! i gave them a call to find out if the order was on the way and i spoke with a lady who was kind but unfortunately did not see my order because the fax did n't come through . while that is n't necessarily a reflection on the restaurant itself it just kind of sucked . i let it go - she was empathetic and told me that the order would leave the store in 20 minutes . around 9 the order showed up and i went and grabbed my food from the driver at my gate . upon opening the food i was surprised of the portion size . you definitely do not get what you pay for . while i do n't mind spending $ 12 on a gyro platter i definitely thought it was a given that it would include at least one pita . the felafel was alright though . $ 4 for a small salad ? no thanks . while i definitely do n't have a problem with the customer service of the restaurant , i do n't think the food is worth the price .
1	i was really nervous bringing my wedding dress to vegas for our wedding . luckily , two young guys at the jet blue counter were really sweet and they let us buckle my dress into the seat next to us . but once we got to vegas , after all of the shuffling and moving about ( i had to carry my dress in cabs , on the tram and down the aisle of the plane ) , my dress was not in wedding-ready condition . i read some helpful reviews on yelp and my fiance and i made an appt . for the lovely ladies at fit for a bride to come and take my dress . it was a relief to have them hold onto my dress for a few days ( that way it was n't in our hotel room where my fiance could see it or where i could spill anything on it ) ; debbie came to the hotel to pick up my dress and she brought it back in pristine condition , pressed and ready to wear on my big day . check this place out if you are in need of a way to have your dress stored and cleaned for a few days while you party in vegas . i highly recommend this place for vegas brides .
0	we had an disappointing experience at fogo de chao earlier this week that was so bad that i am writing my first restaurant review . in celebration of my son 's graduation from college , i selected fogo de chao over a more moderately priced chandler blvd . brazilian restaurant . wrong choice . the food was good but the service was so poor that it would almost be laughable if we had n't been personally affected . the service was initially good ( although everyone seemed to be pressing the purchase of a particular wine on `` special '' ) , but rapidly deteriorated to the point where we could not get anyone 's attention to fill water glasses , etc . a dangerous blunder capped everything off . the wait staff lost my credit card and no one could find it . after 20-plus minutes of waiting , we were getting increasingly nervous about the location of the card - particularly as first a manager came by to ask me for its last 4 digits in order to see if it had been run followed by someone else who asked if we recalled which member of the wait staff had picked it up . the service manager finally informed us that they had located my card which had apparently been left on a service table . the service manager was evidently service manager in title only with no real authority to correct problems . misplacement of a credit card is a large , dangerous gaffe that should not occur in a quality restaurant . given that it did occur , it should have been addressed in a professional manner beyond a mere `` we 're sorry '' followed by a group of waitors with their heads down when we left . what was a special occasion for our family became a very unpleasant one due to fogo de chao 's poor service followed by unprofessional management response . we do n't live in phoenix , so may not have been back to fogo de chao anyways , but our unpleasant experience certainly clinched that decision in a major way .
0	he does get the job done and on time . he is courteous and friendly . i must say , though , that on two separate occasions he took some items of mine with him . the first time i hired him was to install some kitchen appliances , one of the appliances being a gas stove . i purchased a gas range connector kit not knowing that the stove already came with one . so , i ended up with two gas range connector kits . i kept both kits with the stove . he finished installing the kitchen appliances ( a dishwasher , a gas stove , and an over the range microwave ) in a timely manner . after he left i could not find the extra gas connector kit that i had left with the stove . i thought maybe he placed it somewhere on the counter or in the adjacent room where the appliances had been sitting . the extra kit was never found . we hired him again several months later to replace our old garbage disposal with a new one . again , he showed up on time and was friendly and courteous . the new garbage disposal came with its own gasket , flange , and rings . he replaced the old one with the new one in a timely manner and then moved on to some other things in house that needed fixing . upon him leaving , i looked at his bucket of tools he was carrying with him . in the bucket i saw a gasket , flange , and rings . after he left , i was checking out the new garbage disposal and realized that he reused the old flange ( and most likely reused the old gasket and rings as well ) . the new garbage disposal came with a nice , shiny flange . it was obvious to me that he did not use the nice , shiny flange . the gasket , flange , and rings i saw in his bucket of tools were the ones that came with the new garbage disposal . it is one thing to reuse the old gasket , flange , and rings because they seem like they are in good condition . that i can understand . but , he took it to a whole different level of shadiness by basically stealing . yes , i probably would have just placed that extra gas connector kit , gasket , rings , and the nice , shiny flange in a drawer , never to be used . but he could have at least asked to take them . i probably would n't have cared if he asked but he did n't . so that is why i would not hire him again .
0	who does n't love coffee bean & tea leaf ? ! i have been a fan since we moved here 7 years ago . i really like my usual black forest iced coffee . the only reason i am giving this store a 3star is because when i come here at 5pm on a sunday night the drive thru service is so ssllooww ! ! other than that it 's all good. , and yes , i will be back !
1	i 've lived around the corner from beano 's for years , and i 've never stepped in the place . i recently read online that they have great wings , so after the bcs game became a joke , my friend and i decided to go check it out . i expected the place to be a smoky dive bar , so i was very happy to find it almost smoke free . there were only a couple people there , so i 'm sure that helped , but there was no lingering smoke smells . my friend and i split 24 wings with four different flavors along with some cheese fries . the wings are incredibly meaty and delicious ! we tried : general tso - a nice heat , and pretty heavy ginger flavor . almost too much ginger , but still good . dracula 's kryptonite - garlic . lots of garlic . so good . possibly better than bww 's spicy garlic . beano 's butt burner - not nearly as hot as i expected . however , the flavor for this sauce was amazing . hot , but not tear inducing . perfect . chipotle bbq - probably our favorite . the combonation of smoky pepper and sweet bbq sauce was awesome . the cheese fries were solid . nothing to write home about , but decent . service was great ( this may be due to the fact the waiter was an former student of ours ... ) , food was great , decor was what you 'd expect . if you are there for the gambling , they do have a small bank of fort knox slot machines , and then the usual video poker machines around the bar . the only downside to this place is it 's a bit pricey . 24 wings is about $ 25 bucks . a dollar a wing is a but much , in my opinion . i 'd be there a lot more if they dropped the price a little . still , for those times i 'm craving a solid wing choice , and i do n't want to drive up to durango for bww , beano 's will be my go-to place .
1	i used a groupon that was $ 69 for 2 people to go on their club crawl . since the groupon excluded fri & sat of holiday weekends , my roommate & i used it for thu/23 may of memorial day weekend . - check-in at pbr rockhouse ( on the strip , in front of planet hollywood casino/mall ) went smoothly . there were at least 2 hosts ( do n't remember their names but one was female and one was male ) and they were pretty cool . - honestly that night was a blur due to my alcohol consumption but at pbr rockhouse the hosts gave each person a free drink coupon for a pbr well-drink ( or beer ? ) . - after pbr hopped on the party bus and we went to mirage 's 1-oak , luxor 's lax and then finally caesars palace 's pure . - to get from one location to the next the group rode the party bus , a double-decker van which was designed for club-hopping and included some free drinks . - considering the price , convenience for transportation and the nice line-up of clubs ( pure is one of my favorite vegas clubs ) , it was a 5-star yelp deal .
0	i decided to visit my ( work ) neighborhood chinese restaurant today for lunch . i was very pleasantly surprised by the interior- it was clean , well designed , and visually appealing . they appeared to be doing a rather brisk lunchtime service between take-out , delivery , and dine-in . i chose the general tso 's lunch special ( $ 6 ) , for take-out , and sat in their reception area , which very conveniently , had a great selection of magazines for me to read while i waited . all of the lunch specials included either white rice , brown rice , or chow mien , and a cup of egg drop soup and were priced at either $ 6 or $ 7 . the food itself was piping hot , but was pretty average . a little on the greasy side , but a large , filling portion . definitely had a lot of kick and spice to it , as my lips were burning by the end of the dish . i 'd rate it as on par with panda express . for a lunch during the work day , i 'd probably stop by china tango again , but i would n't go out of my way to dine here .
1	we started the night a lot here in college . i never order long islands anywhere else , but that 's the only thing i 've ever ordered here . they are huge , delicious , and $ 3 until 11pm . that is a deal . after one or two of these you really do n't need any other drinks for the rest of the night , they are crazy strong . really fun on game days . you will most likely run into people who lived in your dorm freshman year here ... no matter how many years later it is .
0	long wait , not exceptionally busy . server was no where to be found for extended periods , no update on when food or drinks would arrive during long waits . food was pretty good but the prices seemed high for what was received . friend 's dish had to be sent back because it was cold . i would have given three stars , but upon checking my credit card statement and comparing to my receipt , they tacked on a $ 10 tip to my bill ! never had an issue like this before . really surprising . sounds like other reviewers have enjoyed this place , so maybe i just showed up on the wrong night . regardless , i wo n't be back .
1	without a doubt , my favourite and most frequented takeaway in edinburgh . i have n't sat in but if they serve the same food in the restaurant that i get at home , you 'll love it . always fast delivery and never disappoints .
1	we do n't have these in ny , so i go when i travel . i love their passion fruit iced tea . i love their brown bread with butter . i love the cajun chicken jambalaya . yes , the portions are ridiculous . i try to never ever finish my entree if i can help it . the food is not haute cuisine , but it is really good .
0	i was in town for one night and the company booked this hotel for me . i was n't super impressed by any aspect of the hotel . the parking was difficult , i was n't ever able to find self-parking ( not sure whether or not there was self-parking ) so i had to valet park ( $ 27 ) - which was extremely busy and the line for valet was blocking traffic . check in was smooth and the clerk was friendly . the room was small and dated in many aspects , the bathroom fixtures were particularly telling of the age of the hotel . internet was available but cost $ 13.99 . i was n't able to find a menu for room service - there were many good restaurants within walking distance , so this was n't a huge deal . lastly , i needed to print a boarding pass for my flight the next day and had some difficulty finding the business center ( on the lower level ) . i ultimately had to pay 40 cents per minute and 59 cents per page to print my boarding pass - i travel extensively and typically find that this is offered free of charge . while i understand that it is typical of downtown hotels to charge for every service , i felt that this went a bit to far . to top it off - the hotel charged my credit card ( that had been left on file for incidentals ) for the entire hotel stay - though i had confirmed at check in that my company was being billed for the hotel stay . my company has assured me this was an error on the hotel 's end - not sure what happened , but i am still awaiting a refund for the hotel stay ( company advised me that hotel was supposed to issue a refund ) . overall , i would really give this hotel 2.5 stars - it was a very average and slightly expensive experience when i compare to my other downtown hotel experiences . just meh - nothing that really impressed me .
1	great design and materials shop for flooring and backsplash materials ! they manufacture many of their own products . they will sell directly to the public , but not at the same low prices their contractor customers get . ask for their `` preferred contractor '' list if you need an installer . they have 2 design consultants on hand and my wife and i found them to be very helpful and friendly in planning our backsplash design . we went home with several samples and ended up having our installer purchase our materials there . the store has a pretty good selection of products on display , but is n't as big as a few of the other design shops out there , thus the 4 star rating . still , would highly recommend ubc .
0	i wish i could give no stars . so unfortunate . we are currently still waiting to see the dr. & have been here for over 3 hours ! ! ! ! according to the front desk & the other reviews this is normal . save yourself the frustration & time , go elsewhere .
0	well , i love hooters wings when done the way i like - this hooters does not listen to you during the take out call . asked for extra crispy wings ; got extra soggy ! i know you get what you pay for , but there are far better wings in phoenix .
1	the best part is definitely the bread . i brought my friends to try something different and we left happy . the location and menu may seem intimidating at first but everything we had tasted amazing .
1	the burgers are fresh and hearty , but the lettuce provided kept falling out of my burger . but overall the guacamole bacon cheeseburger was fantastic ! the fries could 've used a little less salt .
0	sushi roku is a cute chic restaurant inside the w , but i was unimpressed with the semi slow service and small variety of sushi variety on the menu . all in all , i think it 's a good place to hang out in groups because of the decor and the drink selection .
1	i am new to the area and this was the first place i went for a drink . amazing ! totally chill and the drinks are awesome for the price . the bartenders actually get to know you
1	they just opened a month a go . cute concept . reminds me of a cool food truck without the wheels . had the seoul burrito . the manager told me korean sauce is the owners mother in laws family recipe . good stuff ! my wife had the cancun salad ... fun presentation and the house made dressing is great . loved the drink selections ! !
1	review is for late night bill 's . drunk food . went against my rule of eating greasy food at night and followed my friend to bill 's at 3am . got steak and eggs for $ 4.99 . comes with eggs ( scrambled or fried ) , a piece of steak , hashed browns , and wheat bread with a crap load of butter on it . ca n't say much about the quality of the beef ( probably rejects from regular dining time ) , but its cheap . asked for medium rare but it seemed well done when i ate it . the wait to get into the eatery seemed extra long ( 30-40 min ? ) but the server was super nice , fun , and tolerant of our giggling & confusion . they 're really nice , even willing to split the check three ways after processing the order . would not come here again because i was horrified at the amount of fat & butter i consumed the next day , but highly recommended for anyone who goes out partying in vegas and suffers from the drunchies !
1	one of the only downfalls was the music being too loud .
0	my girlfriend was riding by herself . without warning , the cab driver tried to grope her chest and solicited sexual favors . he did take her to her destination , but it was a harrowing experience . royal cab has the entire story , but they have not responded to this complaint at all .
1	location , location , location . excellent service . my wife told the server how much she liked the salted caramel pudding and the chef came out and taught her how to make it ! i have only had sandwiches here by they have been outstanding . today i had the turkey pastrami , terrific ! prices are what you would expect to pay downtown at a good restaurant but the food and service keeps us coming back .
1	who would 've thought palm restaurant would be so damn good . it 's definitely not as glamourous as its surrounding competitors , but their food and prices are unmatched . myself and my friend split their 3 course meal which included soup or salad , a choice of main course and side , and dessert . for starters we ordered the ceasar salad . it was a normal ceasar salad that had the perfect amount of dressing and croutons . for our main dish we got the special , a seared halibut with 2 types of mushrooms . it was delicious and filling enough do two people ! the waiter even graciously split the main dish into two plates . i thought that was especially generous and considerate . for a side we got garlic asparagus . the asparagus was also very yummy . for dessert we got the chocolate cake . it was sooooo rich and delicious . makes me drool even thinking of it ! at the end of our meal my friend and i were stuffed ! we were incredibly satisfied with the food and the impeccable service from our friendly and attentive server . 5 stars well deserved .
1	nice bar food . the sweet potato fries are really good ! i had a cheesesteak sandwich , and the beef was tender and lean . so good ! much love to bartenders as well . we ate at the bar , and they took great care of us .
0	so ... i went in to get an ice cream cake made for my daughters birthday and all there cakes where so half ass i could have made it myself for the 30 bucks i spent the `` happy birthday '' was not good quality at all and i was completely disappointed , seeing as tho i always get my cakes from dq
0	i agree with a previous reviewer , the cupcakes were ok , but nothing special . the combinations were interesting , actual cake flavor was good but the frosting was lacking . a couple of the cupcakes had cream cheese frosting , which i normally do n't mind , but would n't expect on a cupcake unless i was ordering a carrot cupcake . i was also a bit put off by the price . they are charging the same price as cupcake shops in larger cities , that typically offer larger cupcakes with much better visual presentation ( both the cupcake & carryout box ) .
0	honestly , the atmosphere is amazing . the interior design , flawless . super cool vibe and our waitress was very attentive and helpful , one of the best i 've met in a while . the only reason we are giving 2 stars is because of the tacos . we were expecting amazing tacos . the appetizer- ceviche was definitely delicious , the chips that came with were my fave ! however , we were disappointed as soon as the main entree came . we eat tacos all the time , especially in az- you can go to the taco trucks and have an amazing meal for $ 1- $ 2 a piece . just because their `` fancy '' does n't necessarily mean they are good . if they fix that , the place would be a 5 star quality restaurant .
1	amazing . this place is beyond expectations . it may seem like exaggerating but im not . this place it definitely left a lasting impression . i bought 3 massages one for my sister , myself and my mother . my sister and i had a therapists named michelle ortiz i believe . and she was outstanding . i play numerous sports and for the injuries and work i put into my body , michelle put in work and effort to take the knots and strain from my muscles plus she was a smaller build , so at first i was hesitant ... but man , she has some muscles . when i asked to put more pressure , she did it with ease . the hot stones were the icing . i was relaxed and worry free . overall experience was great . the attention and concern they had was heart felt . i would definitely recommend this place . already planning my next trip just to make sure i can accommodate to having another visit here .
0	i know everyone and their moms rave about the moules here , but there are those of us who do n't eat seafood . i came here for sunday brunch , just ten minutes after their posted opening time ( 11 ) , and the place was busy . we snagged an open table , but people who showed up just ten minutes after us had to wait . the front area of the restaurant looks pretty nice , though we felt cramped at our table in the back . as a waffle fiend , i had to try the liege waffle , with the seasonal fruit topping , apple and cranberry . i ordered it as a prix fixe meal , with potato strudel as my side and a mimosa . i liked the crystallized sugar which gave the waffle a little crunch , but the waffle was sort of dry . the fruit topping was tasty , though . the potato strudel was okay , but not that remarkable . my brother had the moules with the tomato-fennel broth . it looked like he could use more bread to mop up the broth -- he resorted to using an empty shell as a scoop once he finished the piece of bread . our server did n't check on us after our dishes arrived , so my brother could n't even ask for a spoon . other people 's egg dishes looked good , so i 'd probably go that route if i were to come back for brunch -- but i do n't feel a burning need to return .
1	i 've gone to the glendale location several times over the past 2-3 years . i 've also been to their mesa location , but not in 5 years . i go to watch wwe pay-per-view . at least 5 times a year . i have n't tried it any other time . there 's always a good crowd for wrestling events . we have fun . o'sullivans is large and has plenty of seats . lots of tvs of various sizes . bar is well-stocked . i love black & tans ( guinness and bass ) . they do n't sell bass , so i settle for smithwick 's , a blacksmith . good food selection . i typically do n't experiment with food , i order what i know i 'll like . their meatloaf and shepherd 's pie is great . ribs are o.k . nacho platter is loaded . only problem that i 've had , and this has happened on 3 different occasions , is waitress service . first time , during a period when there was n't a lot of customers around me , i waited 20 minutes to be served . and that was after i notified the manager . he gave me a free drink . second time , it took 10 minutes . a few weeks ago it happened again . it was very busy and i waited about 8 minutes . plus waitress brought me the wrong sized drink . i 'll continue to go to r.t. o'sullivans and report the status of their wait staff .
0	the pizza is pretty good especially since it 's only $ 5.00 for a large . we have ordered from them a few times but the last few months when we called in for delivery the delivery time is always over an hour to two hour wait time . i can understand being busy and a 45 min time frame , but anything that is over an hour wait is ridiculous .
0	do n't do it ! my hubby and i decided to check this place out thinking it must be pretty chill considering they pass out wristbands to get in everywhere you walk around in the monte carlo .. figured it would be fun with chill people looking to have fun without the vegas bullshit and thought it was free it get in . we could not believe we were charged $ 20 each to get in and i was promised two free drinks and my hubby 1. as we ordered our drinks they gave me a pink glass and my hubby a regular and the bouncer would come over and tell my hubby he could not hold or drink from my cup .. are you kidding ? ! ? ! you just charged us 40 bucks to get into this dive and you wo n't even let us drink what we want ! ! ! we were so out of there .. what a waste of money and time .. will never return and i would not recommend !
0	i went here for dinner on a sunday and even though they were running a special , two of us split two tapas and paella . the special runs every sunday , apparently . three tapas and dessert for about 15 quid . looking back , i think i 'd rather have chosen that option . the patatas gratinadas and albondigas we ordered were very tasty but the paella was just a bit too oily for me . other than that , it was a fairly standard dining experience . nothing amazing to report . the lighting is dark and the music is soft , so feel free to take along a hot date . just do n't count on them being wowed out of their knickers .
0	i 'm sad to give this place 2 stars bc my husband & i had a great experience the last couple of times when we were here . we especially loved their baos but when we ate here recently their baos were different . i had ordered their mushroom & tofu bao & it was n't the same . if i remember correctly the tofu & mushrooms were cut up but this time they put a slab of tofu which i prefer it cut up & mixed in with the mushrooms . the duck bao did n't taste as flavorful . it took our food about 30-40 mins to come out & the restaurant was n't even busy . i want the old great bao to come back !
0	i normally go to danny't but i happen to need a car wash last minute and this was the only option . i have been here before in the past and have had a good experience . they seem to have a good system down , which is great . the guys that take your car do n't pressure you to buy additional services , which is great , compared to other car washes . the one thing that is annoying is the fact that they do not have a rain check policy like most car washes do . i washed my car on friday 7/25 in the early afternoon when it was nice and sunny . that night , we had a storm and the same on saturday . so , when i called asking for a rain check , rachel said `` we do n't offer one '' .... ? ? ! ? ! ? so , you are telling me that i pretty much gave away $ 20 on a wash ( plus tip ) ? ? this is ridiculous ! as a paying customer , who supports local business , they should reconsider this policy ! i would recommended this car wash if you happen to be in the area , but do n't bother going out of your way .
1	i followed holly haugan to this salon . the staff is super friendly and per usual holly did a great job on my hair . i have recommended many girl friends to her and they all love her . i definitely recommend .
0	the blackbird has an odd vibe , very much targeted at the trendy 20-30 somethings , i ca n't particularly fault the service or the beverage options but this is n't really my cup of tea ... there probably are n't enough staff on the bar and if they are serious about doing cocktails then this will need to change . as it stands making a cocktail or even a latte seems to be at the detriment to the service of those just wanting a pint . one plus , though a little irrelevant for this time of year , they have made a nice job of the beer garden/outdoor seating area . i may return ( perhaps in a few months they will have found the right balance ) but i wo n't be rushing back .
0	i javent been to this one but the one in surprise i didnt like . one of the trainers would hit on all the girls which i feel victim to made me feel uncomfortable to workout
1	love everything about this place , good decor , food , ambrosia hookah is the best ! happy hour is also a good time to go , 4-7pm ! i will come here often !
0	stayed there in 2009 , the room was old , dark and ugly . if you 're planning on staying there , better to go to signature mgm , which is much nicer . just 5 mins walk from the mgm grand . at least it 's at a great location .
0	went here for lunch after a day of work . two of the soda choices were out of order ( diet soda and sweet tea ) . sandwich was not really good . did n't have that taste you expect from a local sandwich shop . service was all right , but not really much to do for them .
0	a little pricey for what it is . food was n't bad tasting but it 's the little things that get me . serious lack of salsa for one . what they do have are in little tiny 1 ounce cups that you have to ask for , and when you do , they bring you one . really ? that 's enough for maybe 2 bites . do n't skimp on the salsa ! ! a bottle of tapitio on the table , ok not bad , but how about a few other options ? i tried the empanada , there was a warning on the side : `` contents may have settled during shipping '' there might have been 2 tablespoons of filling . yes it was only 1.75 but still ... the pastor burrito was huge , but it was mostly rice and beans . the few chunks of meat i did taste was ok. i ca n't forget the horrible music playing . it has potential but i do n't think i 'll be back .
1	time to give this place a nice update . i was kind of an asshole in my last review . maybe i was a bit too harsh . the asian section is a bit weak , but this store does come through for me in every way . -- the best craft beer selection within a stone 's throw of my home . -- fantastic and fresh produce ! -- delicious soups -- an amazing butcher block -- a lovely supplement selection yes , everything about this place rocks . i am sorry for giving such a weak review last time around . sunflower , if we were a sandwich and i were the peanut butter .... you know your place ... the jam .
0	expensive . good croissants . marginal service . there are about a dozen tables . $ 3.50 for bottle of water .
0	i had read so many awesome things about this place in the last year . `` most improved hotel '' `` best dining '' `` best bla bla '' i was really excited about staying here , but i 'm not a fan . they 've obviously recently done some work to this place , and the decor is actually pretty nice . the beds are super comfortable too , but the furniture , the bathroom and the old a/c unit was just disappointing . the toilet barely flushed , the room stayed fairly warm and i felt dirty after stepping out of the shower . i will say , the casino itself was decent and the ambiance there is quite fun . also , it 's priced correctly i suppose at $ 48 ( for four of us ) , but next time downtown i 'm paying more and trying out the nugget .
0	we were in tempe on vacation ... visited the creamery & used my debit card for payment . much to my surprise when reviewing my statement at home , a tip was added to my original amount , by lauren via 'the square ' credit card processing system they use . i reported this illegal activity of altering credit card receipts to gil , store manager , and rebecca , gm , but have received no resolution . i will ask my credit card company to investigate , but , buyer beware ... lauren still works at the creamery ! ! !
1	best breakfast you will find .
0	just finished one of the worst `` massages '' of my life here and i 've been getting massages 1 - 2 times per month for the past 8 years so that is saying a lot . i say `` massage '' cause it was really mostly just lotion rubbing . second time here today and i 've held off on a review till now . first was okay and just a bit below average , maybe 2.5 - 3 out of 5 but i decided to give this place another chance since they are students after all . i know places like this are all luck of the draw/hit or miss but you could get unlucky like me and waste your time and money . today was way below average , maybe 1.5 out of 5 and the 1.5 stars are solely for their courtesy , cleanliness , and how polite they are . they really are friendly and professional so i 'll give them that . i do feel bad for leaving a bad review considering how nice they are and how they really do seem to be trying but i can not in good conscience let someone else who needs a massage waste their time and money like i did . if you want to pay $ 45 to listen to some relaxing music and have someone rub lotion on you for 80 minutes and not get a single knot out or relieve any tension , then this is the place for you ! i understand this is a massage school but they should teach some technique before letting their students practice on paying clients . 80 minutes and not finding a single knot or sore/tight tendon or muscle is pretty damn difficult considering i sit in front of a computer 8 hours a day 5 days a week and workout 3 - 5 days a week so my entire upper back/shoulder/neck are constantly sore and tight ! if you have ever had a professional massage and want a real , therapeutic massage ... save your time and money and go elsewhere ! sad to say but you 'll even get a more effective massage / more experienced masseuse at those unlicensed $ 20/hour foot massage spas that work on your back for 15 - 20 minutes ! i 've wasted over $ 100 here including tip and almost 3 hours of my time to give this place two chances . learn from my mistakes instead of having to make your own ! i really do n't understand where all these good reviews came from unless the family/friends of students and staff are on yelp ? ?
0	i 'm not reviewing the food , only my experience at the bar . service was good , drinks were made quickly . they ran out of seagrams whisky , however , which is always a bummer . i ordered a vodka cranberry instead , which was extremely bitter . one was enough for me . the band that was playing was fantastic . seriously , theyw ere amazing . they play not only country , but a lot of rock , and even surprised us with their rendition of `` ice ice baby '' ! i would go back for the band . and possibly the drinks , if i 'm not paying for them myself again .
0	in the midst of my examination , dr. ong 's cell phone , which was in his pocket , rang quite loudly . he took his phone out of his pocket , looked at the screen on the phone and he actually answered the call ! he said , `` excuse me , but i need to take this call . '' to say that i was shocked and insulted is an understatement . after about four minutes , he came back into the exam room , apologizing for taking the call , and completed my exam . dr. ong suggested that i might need surgery . one thing is for sure , if i do need surgery , dr. ong wo n't be performing it . i shudder to think of what could happen if he gets a call in the operating room as he made it very clear what his priorities are . if you want your doctor 's undivided attention , as it should be , go some where else .
0	again with the hype for old town bars ... yet another friend said , `` you have to try abc bar '' , this time being el hefe . yet another bar failed to live up to the recommendation . ( though in retrospect , her recommendation was probably due to her running into the same old man who liked to buy all her drinks every time ... should have taken that into account ) . strike 1 : so loud i ca n't hear myself . literally engaging my diaphragm and voice projection training just to make myself heard to my friends and the waitresess . strike 2 : the tacos are not that great . they have duck , which is the only really saving grace about them , but they 're like $ 5 for this little tiny,1/4 of a tortilla sized taco . they tasted pretty boring to me . strike 3 : i had to hunt down my waitress . i mean , i walked around for 10 minutes looking for her to cash out , and this place is small . i was very tempted to walk out on the tab just due to the crappy service .. strike 4 : we got water dumped on us due to the awnings outside . the manager sent us a round of shots , and he was n't fooling anybody , they were pure grapefruit juice . gee , thanks for filling my vitamin c requirement ... ? oh snap , 4 strikes and you are definitely out of the park for good , el hefe .
1	i am an avid coffee drinker and coffee shop browser . this is my favorite cafe in charlotte . i love how quaint it is and how it is small enough to feel very personal- like it could be your regular place or your `` home '' . my family and i came here while searching for houses in the area and i had the best chai tea latte ( and prettiest ) i have ever had . that is saying a lot because i 've had many chai teas at many places ! the vegan zucchini bread is also delish and i make many morning stops to get some for breakfast .
0	i 'm rating this based on it being .. well .. a denny 's . i feel like for any chain , you already know what to expect , so you just rate them based on the variance of each location . no one is going to see a five star denny 's rating and assume it 's in line with robuchon . this location suits me just fine for a cup of severely mediocre coffee before school . i get my own booth to spread my books out for a last minute study cram and the waitresses are always efficient and smiling , especially kelly ! the older lady who works up front is incredibly friendly- pinching babies cheeks kind of friendly . she has that old school diner feel . all of the food ranges from mediocre to fairly gross . i 'm pretty sure they do n't have any unprocessed cheese in the house . the toast is like .. cardboard . i do n't even know . they do have some healthier options clearly marked on the menu and that 's what i always go for , even though they 're all variations of egg whites , spinach and cherry tomatoes with fresh fruit . i like to pretend i 'm eating healthy when i come here , and maybe elsewhere i actually would be had i ordered the same thing - but here , the spinach always comes saturated in grease . it usually comes barely wilted , and while that 's just how i like it .. it makes the grease even more uncalled for . i would n't recommend a denny 's probably ever , but for my last minute school needs , it fits the bill well . the service makes up for the food .
0	we had n't been here for several years and got a coupon so decided to try again for dinner . first impression - dark ! seriously , so dark we ca n't read the menu ( servers had to provide flashlights ) and then could barely see our food . food was ok , but a bit pricey for what we got and service was a bit slow and sporadic . we got a sopapilla for desert and it was strangely salty and sweet . overall , `` meh '' was our reaction . probably wo n't be back .
0	i should have known from the beginning it was n't going to be a good experience . i eat out enough to know the customary greeting a server offers is typically a short greeting followed by a drink order . what i was offered was a question if i had any groupons or other types of discounts . i did happen to purchase a $ 10 for $ 5 here from yelp she tells me `` i thought we discontinued that , hmmm '' . not a great way to start . when my friend asked if it was possible to order happy hour she said in a very snooty way there was no way to mix the coupon and happy hour prices . not even if we split the check . i do n't have a problem with that , it was the way she felt she needed to inform us . she started to walk away while we figured out what we wanted , again still not asking if we wanted anything to drink . i had to ask if she could get our drink orders . at this point i knew i did n't want to have a meal here but i did n't want to waste my $ 5 i had spent on yelp for this place so i ordered an appetizer to split with my friend . it was very good but not worth ever visiting again . had that been the worst of it this review would be much different . the remainder of our visit we were ignored for large portions of time and received more attitude each time she did decide to stop by . it was understaffed and i 'm sure this is why she was n't in the best of moods but that does n't excuse taking it out on the customers .
0	horrible service ! ! but good food ! ! we were seated right away , our drinks and order was taken almost immediately . then nothing happened . we had to flag down our server for refills . it 's a bbq place but we only ordered the fish . the place was not packed so i am not sure why the food wait was so long . the food was wonderful . we ordered the catfish , blackened tilapia and michele tilapia . the macaroni and cheese was awesome and we all wished we had more than one serving of that . but , i had the manager called over to complain about the following . 1. getting sprayed with water as a busser cleared the next table 2. the forgotton salad was mentioned to the runner that brought the food and minutes later the server came to say she forgot and if we still wanted it . 3. my chair getting hit by the vacuumer as he cleaned and placed chairs on tables all around us . i mentioned this was a bad first experience and it was our anniversary . she apologized and said she would send over a dessert on the house . after the meal , the server came by and dropped off the bill . i mentioned we were supposed to get dessert compliments of the manager ... she said well you never ordered it , although she knew about it . i want to go back because the food was delicious , but my husband is n't willing to go with me . maybe we are better off getting to go orders . here is a tip ... if you easily get motion sickness ... so not face the aqaurium !
1	my boyfriend and i 's go-to neighborhood restaurant . i love their chongqing chicken .... fried morsels of chicken w/ fresh garlic , peppercorns and chili peppers . and their beef noodle soup . we usually share dan dan noodles too !
1	inexpensive ... well situated ( latin quarter ) large well furnished clean rooms ... friendly helpful staff ... indoor pool and bar/restaurant on site ... very nice . if i 'm ever back in montreal i would stay here again .
0	returned to the roadrunner after a long time away over the weekend . if there is a symbolic bar of my late 20 's , this one fits the bill ... and it 's still open which is rare . back in the day 4 stars easily , and the experience this past friday night was great , i just think ( like others ) that they need to step up their game and update the place . get some decent lcds and update the cowboy decor , nothing wrong with country but after a while even the cows go out to pasture . open patio is solid and the bartenders were friendly and entertaining . and the beer selection still has a nice variety . it was also nice to have the premium drafts comped after throwing some money at the machines without limiting it to certain taps . it was pretty dead for a friday night but it worked out great for a nice time with a friend and grabbing a beer , much more relaxed feel than bjs where we hopped from earlier in the night .
1	i came here on a referral for jayna . i 've lived in las vegas for years , but have had no honest luck in finding a go-to for hair until now . jayna was amazing . she was super patient and involved . even though i kept changing my mind throughout the haircut about how i wanted it , she continuously assured me , `` you 're going to leave here with the hair you want ! '' that saint of a woman worked on my head for 2 hours . i walked in with a vague idea of what i wanted/what i did n't want and still walked out with a haircut that i really love . she let me know that if a couple of days pass and i see anything that needs changing , to come back in and she 'd fix it up . it 's been a few days now , and this morning i looked in the mirror for the first time in months without utter contempt for my hair . i wo n't be needing to go back for any touch ups , but i will be coming back for future cuts . the communication was fantastic , the service was great , and the job was well done . thanks , jayna . as for the salon side of my experience , it was really cool . conversations are `` anything goes , '' often resulting in entertaining banter . while i was there , i heard people talking about everything from opinions about serial killers , to trainspotting , to raising kids , and more . bands like joy division , fleetwood mac , and eighties pop played over the speakers . lots of life and joyful activity in the space . i noticed there were walk-ins , but i made an appointment and would recommend doing the same in case you unfortunately come across a client like me , who hoarded poor jayna for hours . also , though i did n't see it , i hear that you can bring in a six pack to enjoy while your hair gets fabulous . that 's tugs at my heartstrings , right there .
0	we ate here the last evening we stayed at circus , circus . it was n't horrible . we just walked in , no line . the drink and dessert lanes were nice . salad bar was basic but fresh tasting . they had several different set ups-a fried chicken and fixings , a turkey and fixings , one kids foods-pizza type stuff , a carving station with roast beef , turkey and pork roast i think , a fish/seafood section nothing to get too excited about , and a taco area . we ate here the night after a rather disappointing dinner at the garden grill . the buffet was actually an improvement . if you are staying in the hotel , too tired after a long day of walking and if there is n't a long line it 's ok. it would n't be that great if you had to wait in line . and definately would n't make a special trip to visit .
1	definitely an interesting little place up in north phoenix , la oaxaquena hovers between a three and a four , but closer to four . i stopped in for lunch and was shocked to see that there was not a single soul in there except for me . what the heck ? ? the classic unassuming strip-mall mexican place , the interior was much bigger than normal and the colors were interesting but i thought they added a nice touch . the cashier / server girl was really friendly and service was super fast . on to the food - i went with the lunch special of a taco and tostada for $ 4.95 ( what a steal ! ) . i was assuming when i requested chicken that both items would have chicken on them - something to keep in mind . the taco was excellent ! a crunchy shell housed deliciously tender chicken , and fresh lettuce and tomato on top . the tostada was ok , but i think that has way more to do with the fact that i 'm not a huge refried beans fan . oh , and the chips and salsa were some of the best complimentary additions i 've had . as daren c. mentioned , $ 5.35 total will get you some good food , and you 'll leave stuffed and ready to pass out in the afternoon of your job .
0	i broke the number one yelp rule , i did n't use yelp before i went here . if my hotel was n't charging me 5.99 an hr to use wi-fi , i would have logged into yelp using my tablet . instead , picked up a local rag that described this place as `` great '' . price was reasonable , , but the food had no flavor , tasted like cardboard and flat out sucked ass . i only ate half my plate and i usually eat about 4 plates at a buffet . i think hometown buffet is better than roundatable . avoid this place if your a fan of good , tasty food .
1	yes i liked this place . kind of weird to see people bungee jumping off the building when you look out the window but ok. the food was great . we went with a large group because we were on a business trip . it also took a little getting used to the rotating restaurant thing but after a couple of drinks no one really noticed anymore .
0	trendy ambiance , fresh sushi , but the worst hibachi i 've ever had . first with my sushi review : i have been here multiple times for sushi and liked the bar set up and thought the sushi tasted fresh and the service was quick . good for happy hours ( especially thursday specials ) or dates . however i do n't like how if you only want to order sushi you have to sit at the bar . it makes it impossible to go there as a group or you end up waiting forever if there are n't enough seats in the bar area .. when the entire back room could be open . the reason for my 2-star review is the hibachi , something that is pretty standardized among restaurants , but nakama did n't have any of it right the time i went . the miso soup tasted like the packet cup of soup you buy in college . i ordered the shrimp and it turned out tough and rubbery . i also tried some of my friend 's steak , which was also well done and dry . the hibachi chef did n't even ask how she wanted it to be cooked . also , even though it 's similarly priced to other hibachi restaurants , you have to up charge for fried rice and do n't even have the option of noodles . bottomline : go to nakama in small groups for sushi but stay away from the hibachi
1	since everyone eventually reviews p.f . chang 's , i thought i would give you all an alternative , a great , americanized chinese food restaurant . the golden phoenix is a great example of a successful chinese restaurant . they do excel in most ways but fall short in others . first off , for an appetizer , get the mu shu , its the best i 've found in town . the hot and sour soup is great too , good balance of flavors . great noodles , and rice always seems fresh . most of the chicken and tofu entrees are cooked extremely well , as the chicken is tender and tofu is firm and sauteed well . now for the not so good , stay away from beef entrees . as most chinese restaurants , the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed , its tough if not cooked delicately , most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery , michelin/goodyear like . stick with chicken or tofu . as for the service and decor both are better then most . the restaurant looks like a chinese restaurant should , bright with asian decor . the service is prompt and professional . as a previous review stated , they do n't handle parties well , i disagree , i planned a party for 25 and they handled it quite well . in fact when the check came i tipped above the automatic gratuity ( reserved for large parties ) . take out is outstanding as i tend to call in my order and pick up rather then a take out from pei wei ( support the little guy ! ) . to make things easier the menu is available online at their website . here is the web address , at this time though its not loading properly , check again if the page is not available . http : //goldenphoenixrestaurant.com/
1	do n't get why people like the place but then they complain about price . they have a few things that are on sale ( usually the stuff that is n't in great demand for some reason or another ) and they matched their online price for a table i got . some stuff that is unusual can be pricey but ikea is right across the street and while cheaper , a lot of the stuff they carry is not worth the low price . thingz carries the recycled steel furniture made in colorado which i really like . i find everyone to be helpful and friendly . the only thing that felt weird about is the cleanliness of the place . for example the high top chairs by the checkout counters were dirty and it was showing in the fabric they were made of .
0	i went for lunch , thanks to the locals eat 1/2 price promotion . i have to say , the presentation is nice . tons of selection to choose from . pizza is from scratch & tastes like pizza ( which many places have a hard time doing ) . the whole line looks clean & well taken care of . the service was great . wait staff was attentive but not overbearing . with the food selection , i would hope to have a higher quality of taste . there really was n't too much that stood out as `` man , i have to have more of this ! '' the clam strips & fried haddock were solid choices . the meatloaf & salisbury steak had a freezer-burnish kind of taste to me . when i think of a buffet with a $ 18.00 price tag for lunch , i would prefer to eat things made fresh & not something that sysco foods would sell & you reheat later . pasta section also did not have anything too enticing on there . i would like to see a bit more of a fruit selection . watermelon & cantaloupe get kinda boring . even fresh pineapple would have been a step up . desserts ... gelato bar selection had some intriguing choice with orange dreamsicle & tiramisu . did not see any toppings to add on . also , there were some pies to select from , and some cannolis . i was hoping for some carrot or cheesecake . neither were there . the buffet is worth it for locals as far as price meets quality . i would not pay full price for this . instead i would opt for the planet hollywood or m buffet .
0	i went back to give this a try again , and it was not the same . first , this donut shop does not open until 9am on a saturday . . . what sort of donut shop opens that late on a saturday and is closed on sunday ? second , when i did get there , i saw that they were unpacking donuts from another location . i have a feeling that they get them from their other location on eastern . i wanted a boston cream and was given a filled donut without chocolate . i asked if this was for sure a boston cream and they said , yes . . . but without the chocolate . well when i got home , this glazed donut was filled with whip cream . . . completely gross . the other donuts were n't good either and we ended up throwing them away . i do n't know what happened since the last time i was there , but i certainly never going back . besides , if you 're going to resell donuts that other people make , you should resell the ones from friendly on boulder highway . now i would go to your donut shop if you sold their donuts . . . it is just too far to go to boulder highway everytime we want donuts .
1	great place for breakfast ! really like the fact that they have livermush on the menu .. not very many places that have it around here . the place has that `` dive '' atmosphere which i really like . it brings back memories of the dives in the small town where i grew up . super friendly service , great food , good prices ..... what more can i say ! ? !
0	fell into the `` it was on food network so let 's visit '' trap . it was an okay breakfast , but the service was pretty lackluster . not worth driving from phoenix for the food , however ; the drive itself is very nice and they have a lovely patio on which you can eat your eggs .
0	hate doing this but for a 13 $ margarita after tip i had to . i came in for a cadillac margarita with hornitos and grand marnier like i did last week . i got a different glass and a different liquor . i asked if it had grand manier , since i seen what looked like a citrus patron bottle on the counter . she said they were out of grand marnier ! how do you run out of grand marnier at a mexican restaurant ? i seen three bottles of grand marnier sitting on the shelf a foot away from me .
1	pretty cool cafe with a mixed vibe . seems like a lot of the workers & patrons are feminists which is awesome ( especially since i 'm living in utah right now with a serious dearth of feminists among other politically active people ! ) , but on the other hand there is a pretty distinct yuppie feeling to the place - but that is probably due to it 's downtown location . the barista 's were all very friendly & helpful . they pull good shots of espresso and are pretty attentive to details . odd detail i noticed and thought was pretty cool : their bathrooms are exceptionally clean , consistently . there is a lot of local ( assumption ) artwork for sale in the cafe that is quite nice - adds a good feel to it having dresses , sculptures , etc on the walls that is not only pleasant to look at but available to buy . ps - free wireless .
0	i would have to agree 100 % with previous rvw from brian : i do n't see this lasting into the summer . for some reason , yesterday there was another rvw with a 1star , which is now missing ? ? ? ? anyhow , we also saw many of the staff standing around together and chatting . we found the whole vibe to emit very strange & weird `` somethings-just-not-right '' kinda thing , and just overall we too were uncomfortable - no zen aspect whatsoever . it did n't help matters at all that our bartender did not have on his hospitality hat . i found him condescending & arrogant , not friendly and frankly fairly rude . there is an extensive martini list , which , with all the advertising i had heard & read about , seemed to have been a draw for me to check it out . they all use different ingredients & tend to lean towards sweet ( grenadine , curacao , ect . bleck ) . ok , so that is just my opinion , i know ( i like em crisp n clean ) . so i was interested in the new vodka names which were unfamiliar to me . 1 drink had lychee in it , so i inquired , `` was that a lychee infused vodka ? '' ( many of their martinis do not indicate the base : vodka , tequila , gin ? ? ) . the reply was a taunt `` lychee is a chinese fruit '' . `` um , ok , yes i know what it is , i eat them all the time , they have a red shell and white inside . my question was , is that the vodka ? '' another terse reply , `` well , i infuse it myself , it 's a spirit. '' . ok , this is not going well . so i ask about another concoction , i think it was made with primavera vanilla ? ( or brand which began with `` p '' ) so i asked `` was that a vodka ? '' once again he basically avoided answering by saying something irritating like , well there 's 4 different flavors , or you can get it plain . i 'm like ? ! ? ! ? ! ? i was nowhere nearer to being educated on their very confusing ingredients . i thought the way to get around it was to ask for vodka straight up . i saw they had effen black cherry ( totally awesome infused vodka , btw ) . that 's pretty simple , correct me if im wrong ? but he stands there , with an idiot face , and i felt the vibe of he wanted to argue with me and could n't believe he has to lower himself to do this task ? now , again , i 'll point out , this was a very simple task : grab the vodka bottle , pour it into a shaker with lots of ice , shake it , pour it , serve it . this could n't possibly go wrong , right ? guess what ? it arrives and i sip it - well for some unknown reason he took it upon himself to add water , yes , water it down ! nice ! ! this is really irritating me , because not only was mine watered down , ( who does that ? ! ) so was hubby 's tini with way too much soda . yes the description indicated a splash of soda , but i would guess it was 50 % of the 4oz pour - unacceptable . i should also point out that i too saw the bartender & servers chat incessantly with , what appeared to be the manager - but this `` employee '' , of some sort , was initially drinking beer at the bar , but would get up and go behind the bar to help himself to items . wth ? either you are working or you are not . pick which one and stick to it . he made no secret that he was associated with the establishment , as he engaged another table in discussion as to the up-coming specials and hours and menu changes . in closing , i have to say this is in a great location , and i was really looking forward to visiting - i had such high hopes ! the hype they put out there on emails , twitter , texts , ect . made them sound fabby . it 's unfortunate that such little details all gathered up to me as a complete strike-out & not a fun night out . thank goodness for dependable roka akor , which we promptly parked ourselves at , and as usual we were treated with the upmost high standards , excellent drinks , fantastic service , and amazing food . they have happy hour all night there , if you do n't already know ! rawk on !
0	well what can i say ? it 's a cheap , clean place ... the food was so so it actually depend of what you eat ... do not try the bbq beef if you do n't want to run to the restroom that 's for sure lol ... everything else was okay ... but i would n't go back
0	having visited the barrymore twice previously for lunch , i was looking forward to giving it a shot for dinner . unfortunately , bad service and below average food ensure i wo n't be returning for a fourth time . our group received slow service every step of the way . despite the restaurant being 3/4 empty , we had a long wait to be seated , receive menus , have our orders taken , receive our food and get the check . we had to ask for a drink menu and bread . we had long stretches when our server was nowhere in sight . i ordered the filet cooked medium . it was raw . others in our group also received their food undercooked . i liked the barrymore as a hidden gem away from the bustle of the strip , but after this experience i wo n't return and will quit recommending it to others . update : management from the barrymore contacted me as a result of this review in an effort to get more information and to make things right . i declined the offer for a comped meal , but the genuine concern from management is a good sign that they 're trying to do the right thing .
1	this is my favorite trader joe 's store . love the layout and the employees . it also helps that most of the gents that work here are very easy on the eyes .
1	i had the best massage today . the person that was my massage therapist has magic hands . i 've already booked another massage the week after next with the same therapist ! i am looking forward to coming back . i 've found a gem : - )
0	i got dessert here , the s'mores option , which apparently they 're known for . it has a banana cooked with marshmallow and chocolate on it and served with sides of peanut sauce , ice cream , chocolate flakes , and graham crackers . not a fan , the banana tasted weird and grainy . and it did n't really work together . the only thing i enjoyed about the dish was the roasted marshmallows on top of the banana which i wiped clean off the plate . oh and i ate the vanilla ice cream ... i mean you ca n't really mess that up . i added an extra star for the dessert that my friends had , i think it was called the baked alaskan something ... not 100 % sure . but it had the mildly sweetened strawberry glaze and fluffy as a cloud cake with a frosting so light and delicious that you 'll think you 're eating extra whipped cream . move over banana s'more b/c alaska strawberry something was the star in this show .
1	well you do n't come here to save money . you come here to organize your home and this store has items i have never even thought of . i will tell you that $ 700 dollars later , my pantry is transfromed into a streamlined facet of my kitchen . money well spent .
0	price . price price . i tried supporting a smaller hardware business over the big box stores but when the price difference is 50 % to even nearly 100 % that is just wrong . i will drive the extra half mile to lowes and home depot from now on . example . swan heavy duty garden hose 5/8x100 ' monroe hardware : 66.09 lowe 's 39.98 that is 40 % more expensive . ludicrous
1	paul patates est une v\u00e9ritable institution de pointe-st-charles et vaut vraiment une visite si vous \u00eates dans le coin . un beau petit diner au look d'autrefois , on y trouve une des meilleures poutines du sud-ouest et la meilleure bi\u00e8re d'\u00e9pinette en ville ! mais , n'essayez pas d ' y aller en lendemain de veille le dimanche ... ils sont ferm\u00e9s : (
0	visiting a gordon ramsey restaurant was to be a highlight of our vegas trip for my teen , who enjoys his master chef shows . we so wanted to like this restaurant ... but it was n't to be . we thought the decor and ipad menus were neat , but the tight server uniforms rode up on the waitresses thighs to the point i worried we were going to see more than intended . we started with the truffle fries , which were tough and tasted stale . instead of being golden brown and crisp , they were pale and appeared to have been sitting a long time between frying . when offered a replacement , we switched to the maui onion rings and they truly were fabulous . the worst part of the experience though was the burgers . we ordered one farm burger and one chanterelle mushroom burger , both well done . both came , sans any sauce , and severely under done ... very pink inside . you would think a restaurant specializing in burgers is very experienced in cooking them to the customers desired done ness ( otherwise why ask `` how would you like that cooked ? '' ) . we sent those back as well , and told the waitress to not rush , we 'd rather have them done than fast . when our replacement burgers arrived , one was fine but the other was pink on one side . when it was returned as well ( with no offer of selecting a different entree ) , we were so disappointed . my teen ate her farm burger and just as we were ready to request the check ( and go find another option for lunch for me since i was now starving ) , the on duty manager approached and comp't our meal . this was nice ( and the right thing to do ) , but i would have greatly preferred to speak to him much earlier and actually eat something for lunch , so having him not appear until that point was actually the coffin nail that labeled our experience an `` epic fail '' .
1	one of my favorite places to go on friday and saturday night for seafood is maestro 's ocean club . i try to get there by 5:00 pm so i can eat dinner at the bar without having dinner reservations . after 5:30 the bar is very crowded and music begins at 6:30 and there is a small area next to the band where you can dance . the bartenders at maestro 's are amazing and every drink they serve comes in a 16-oz cocktail shaker so you 're basically buying two drinks . for appetizers i recommend the dungeness crab cocktail , oysters rockefeller , ahi tuna tartare and lobster bisque . for my main course i recommend the chilean sea bass , pacific swordfish and the florida grouper . of course if you 're craving a great steak you can never go wrong with the bone-in filet , new york strip or the rib eye . if you love mash potatoes you must try the mastro 's mashed potatoes or the lobster mashed potatoes . mastro 's receives a five star rating for great service and the food is consistently good .
1	i 've been using preflight for all my business trips ... i 've used others but preflight has been the most consistent and reliable . i would highly recommend these guys for off site airport parking .
0	my dream is to one day own a pair of christian louboutins , which is why going to this boutique was a huge deal for me . i even told the sales associate this , but he clearly had no interest in a teenage girl ( hello , i 'm your future customer ! ) who liked shoes . admittedly , i was dressed casually and wearing puma tennis shoes . i did n't get any comments directed towards me except a hi when i first walked in . we were there around 7 at night and the staff was clearly bored and crammed into a very small place . the shoes are beautiful and there are so many . the handbags were nice also , but the shoes are the main attraction . i 'm giving this 3 stars because the shoes are incredible and the store was organized and clean ( but cramped ) . however , i base a lot on how employees treat the customer and there was a lot left to be desired . higher end stores should remember that there 's a new generation of fashion lovers that need to be treated with care in these hard economic times .
0	certainly a decent option if you are looking for a healthy alternative to all the fast food places nearby . pizza was good , not great . salads were a bit underwhelming . the descriptions on the menu are better than the actual item . space is nice enough , better for lunch than dinner .
1	big portions , great price , good food . i 'll have to come back and try some new dishes . there 's a lot on the menu
0	when this place first opened i probably would have given it 4-5 stars . the food was delish , service was excellent , and the had a bunch of good signature cocktails . like alot of other places when they get popular , food , and service suffer . went a couple days ago after not going for like 2 years and i just was n't impressed with anything . im mean it was still ok ; but not as good as it used to be .
1	i 've had my own mountain bike for almost 2 years now . shortly after i moved to phoenix , my father and i decided to go get bikes so we could enjoy rides together . he lives about 7 miles from dna cycles in mesa . so , this is where we went . the staff was friendly and outgoing . they encouraged us to take whatever bikes we wanted out into the lot to ride 'em around . they talked with us about what we wanted to do with the bikes . my dad wanted to ride more on the street ; i wanted to work up to conquering dirt paths . they recommended a 70 % street bike for my dad , who could take it off-road if he wanted . they suggested i get a bike that is designed for more mountaineering but wo n't scoff at riding on pavement . their selection was wide enough that we had a somewhat difficult time deciding what to get . with the help of the staff , we narrowed our choices down and bought two bikes . my dad jokingly asked what he could get for free , and they guy who helped us joked back before throwing in two free water bottles . that was cool . i did n't get any accessories or anything , but whenever i think about investing in a helmet or more padding on my tush , i always think of going back to dna cycles . they definitely treated us well !
0	came 2 days in a row . thursday great service , today , rude rude rude . does n't even matter about the food when you feel like you 're bothering the staff .
1	starting from friday i believe that they have a bbq crepe special until its sold out , which is the winner for me . its filled with tender bbq meat and a side of coleslaw . nutella crepe is also my favorite sweet one . great spot , crepes are consistent , owners super friendly .
1	the only thing missing from this buffet is a slightly eccentric candy factory owner donning a top hat and cane with small orange people running around doing his bidding . seriously , dessert is the name of the game around here . too bad my booze soaked stomach and affinity for salty food led me straight to the asian counter first , where i stuffed myself full of sushi , fried calamari , chow mein , broccoli beef , korean bbq , and a myriad of random gourmet offerings i saw on the way back to my table . i then proceeded to walk towards the omlet station , where something so seductive and indulgent caught my eye that i could n't look away . a giant , industrial sized , silver bowl of freshly fried bacon lay steaming in front of me , and would eventually be my demise . of course , i still tried the duck confit ravioli , the prime rib , and the honey goat cheese pizza , but after that bacon i was so stuffed it was n't the same . when i finally realized i had enough room for dessert , i meandered over to the desert area where i proceeded to become confused . am i still in the buffet , or did i wander into some kind of gelato shop/bakery ? well , judging by the gentleman carrying away a plate piled the size of a football helmet with dainty little desserts , i 'm guessing i 'm still in the buffet . carrot cake , chocolate lava cake , brownies , cookies , chocolate and lemon mousse shots , donuts , and an entire gelato station are just a few of the desserts offered here . and what 's more , the desserts were actually good ! so my advice to someone going here for the first time -- have dessert first because it 's their best offering ! also , for those of you who do not have a pounding hangover when you roll in here , they offer unlimited mimosas for around $ 9/ person . and trust me , they are truly unlimited . a group of about 15 texas a & m students at the table next to us had a pyramid of close to 100 empty mimosa glasses stacked in the center of their table . this buffet is very good , but at $ 40/ person it is a bit pricey . still , if you like the ambience of the cosmopolitan and want to eat ridiculous quantities of food that would normally be served on small white plates in stuffy little bistros , this is a cool spot .
0	ever watch those `` flip my house '' shows ? that 's basically what happened here . rumor looks like it was once a run down crappy motel that was flipped into a trendy hotel . the decor is very pretty and modern , but there are still remnants of the old crappy motel lingering . this is a huge party hotel for locals . we got a cabana by the pool and it was kind of boring . nothing special . it 's an ok hotel if you need a place to stay last minute , but definitely not on my top 10 list .
0	after paying to park at the weak excuse of a mall that this place is located in we figured we might as well at least try to get our parking moneys worth so we stopped in and ordered up a couple margaritas to ease the pain of being bamboozled . i 've definitely had better drinks and i 've definitely had worse . ca n't speak for the food here but i definitely would n't be running back for happy hour or any other hour for that matter to throw one back .
1	dive , divy , diviest bar in phoenix i think , and so awesome for it . staff is friendly and no-nonsense , so keeps the trouble down , cheap drinks , and a fun time if you 're into that sorta thing . i highly recommend a visit if youre looking for a divy spot to have an icy cold beer . by far , the coldest beer ive ever had , but not frozen or slushy . the glass alone will make you beg for the arizona summer . even the owner is friendly , which seems common sense but we all know is n't always the case . if anything changes , i 'll update the review , because i am definitely coming back here again .
1	this local mexican joint is down the road from me a such a gem to the neighborhood ! while putting in my order , the nice lady upfront gave me lots of good suggestions . she took such initiative , i was almost certain she was the owner . upon asking her if this was her store , she shook her head and said that she was just a staff . if only all businesses had staff like her ! turns out you ca n't really go wrong with anything on the menu . our group of friends ordered just about everything and let our forks fly without borders . the portions are splendidly gianormous . order a platter and split that sucker in half to save for later . i love big portions- it means i do n't have to cook lunch for work the next day ! all orders also come with 'special ' bread . dip the bread in a tub of honey and you 'll feel like you just entered into carb mecca . what a wonderful feeling it is !
0	this was once my favorite sushi restaurant in charlotte , until a recent visit where i found the menu to be completely changed , with a whole lot of great rolls missing . the xoxo used to be the reason i came here , i could n't find a roll like it anywhere else , now that along with the crunchy salmon rolls , the kawai roll appetizers and the entire dessert menu are gone . i ca n't understand why so many favorites would be removed from a restaurant 's menu . and i could not find a good alternative on the menu . unfortunately pisces has now gone from my favorite sushi place in charlotte that i took all of my out of town visitors to , to a place i am unlikely to return to . sky asian bistro , rusan 's , and nikko now all blow pisces out of the water . shame really . was a great place .
1	i 've been to lidia 's a few times before and figured i 'd leave a review after today 's trip . we arrived a bit early for our reservation and they were able to seat us right away . even with a fairly packed dining room , the place was n't too loud . if you have any old people in your group , they can seat you downstairs as i do n't think they have an elevator ( i prefer being upstairs overlooking looking the dining room , it 's a nice touch ) . the lobster arancini were cooked perfectly with no crunchy , undercooked risotto inside . the only downside was that there were just 3 ( we had 4 people ) and they were tiny so it was almost impossible to split them . as for entrees , the gnocchi topped with a duck ragu are a fantastic dish , not too rich and the gnocchi simply melt in your mouth . the zuppa di pesce has a wonderfully balanced broth which was n't oversalted ( a surprise given the amount of shellfish ) and tasted like it might have had sherry wine in it . i think i counted 7 or 8 different items in this seafood hodgepodge . as for service , it was quite good and we were done with 3 courses in a bit over an hour . lidia 's certainly ranks up there as one of my favorite italian restaurants in the city .
1	health is wealth and if you 're a health buff like me , you may want to try this place out . my friends and i needed some time to relax after our first class and decided to take a break from mcdonalds and hang out here instead . it was fine and dandy and had an 'einstein bros bagel ' feel to it . i ordered a jamaican jerk chicken wrap and a sunny day smoothie ( to brighten up myself from the gloomy weather outside ) for my sides , i chose the sour cream and onion flavored baked lays potato chips . despite the spiciness of the jjc wrap - spicy food are my mortal enemies - i actually liked the flavor it had and would recommend it to anyone who 's willing to be adventerous and try something new . our next dish to try is the buffalo chicken and the totally turkey . of all the things i wished this place had , it would be different sized smoothie cups . i had a feeling my order would be too much for me to even finish and i was right . my 2 friends had to help me devour the remaining wrap and i went on to sip at the smoothie the rest of the day . toodloo mcdonalds . wo n't be visiting you for awhile .
0	orange table gets a lot of yelp love for their brunch menu but unfortunately i have only been here for lunch . it is within walking distance of work and reasonably priced so that makes it a great option for a weekday lunch . however , this also means i also have n't tried their yummy sounding cocktails or their selection of craft beer . the salad and sandwiches i have tried have all been yummy . my favorite so far is the grilled cheese but last time we came they were out of the gouda ( which is what makes it so good ) . actually , they seem to run out of stuff a lot . and the quinoa salad is apparently not offered any longer , even though it is still on the menu , but i keep forgetting this and so i am continually disappointed . the service is also hit or miss and usually a little slow . however , you ca n't beat a nice meal out on the patio and if you are lucky there will be something going on at the outdoor mall performance space . last time i was there my coworkers and i got to watch a native american dance and music show while we enjoyed our meals . awesome . i look forward to many more lunches here ( at least while the weather stays nice ) but i wish they would be a little more consistent with their menu offerings and train their servers to be a little more on the ball .
0	this is a place for kids . there is very little to do for them though ... the phx zoo is a much more entertaining spot to take the little ones .
1	super fast lunch service . the sub was great and great . i had the spicy italian it was fresh and priced great for lunch . i highly recommend this subway as it was clean , fast and friendly staff .
1	i love a good cocktail bar and am glad i found this gem -- it 'll be my new go-to place for drinks in montreal . it 's a perfect place for a date or catching up with friends . intimate and cozy -- not the best for a large group , mind you . i was a bit put off by having to line up , but it was ~10pm on a saturday night . my party of 3 ended up waiting for 15-20 minutes in the little hallway behind the velvet curtain . we did n't mind too much . it did seem a bit odd that there was a dude in a tuxedo manning the entrance . he was very strict about letting people poke their heads in to see what the bar looked like ( since there are no windows and it 's just a tiny unassuming red door ) . he would let people in based on his own discretion -- it did n't make a whole lot of sense because he would sometimes let a bunch of people in , yet no one had exited in a while . whatever . once you 're in , it 's a beautiful , elegant place . you feel worlds away from the busy rue st. laurent ... it 's got that speakeasy vibe . the hanging bottles of japanese whisky , candlelit tables , soft jazz , and bow-tie-wearing servers create a cool atmosphere . the crowd is eclectic -- everything from university students to hipsters to middle aged couples . the drinks are good and reasonably priced . i really enjoyed my champagne cocktail ( made with cava , $ 10 ) . i also had a negroni , which was good but super-strong so i had to sip that one very slowly . the servers are very knowledgeable about booze . my dc had a manhattan and the server went into great detail about the different whisky options and what would work best for the cocktail . saw some people order the bourbon lemonade ( $ 25 ) . it comes in a little glass bowl and you can serve yourself with a ladel . cute . they also have some snack items like edamame , veggies and dip , etc . we did n't try those though . okay , big in japan is a little bit scene-y , but it offers a cool experience , great service and very few tourists . i will be back .
0	my boyfriend and i ate here because he had a groupon . normally i do n't dig italian but i tried to stay open .... the menu is great and all but , man , salty food ! my minestrone soup was good , but both my salad ( who salts a salad ? ? ! ! ! ) and my boyfriend 's chicken parmigiana dish were so heavily salted you could barely taste any distinct flavors . the service was good , and all else but man , i could n't drink enough fluid the rest of the night to
0	be careful when you order the tikki marsala , i had found feathers in the sauce ... i 'm not coming back ..
0	happy hour- super cheap , good deals . cheap sake , cheap beers , cheap sushi . the downside- you get what you pay for . the sushi is made in the same process as going to a subway . everything is wrapped in plastic wrap and they just plunk the ingredients onto rice . white sushi chef re-wraps it a few time , `` i think that will stick '' , and walla ! sushi ! would i recommend the sushi ? no . but i would recommend the sushi if you want cheap eats . yes . its ' a little better than going to the grocery store for sushi , but not much .
0	if you are actually hungry skip this place and head over to hubert 's burger bar restaurant instead . the food was tasty but bite sized and the price is very high for what you are getting .... throw in the fact they charge you for refills on soda and bread and i will say ... pass . too many choices of great restaurants to settle for this ... overrated .
0	horrible ! ! if your still curios , keep reading . been to this location on two separate occasions . first time , soon after they opened . we were seated in the bar area . drinks and chips came out quick and that was the best part of the night . i had to flag down our waitress several times to get a refill . chips were n't refilled . although at the door leading to the patio were about 6 of the `` kids '' that refill drinks and refill chips just standing around not doing a lick of work . our dinner took about 1/2 hour to come out , and it was just eghhhh .... i chalked this experience up to grand opening issues . waited about 3 weeks before heading back . this time around it was 9pm on a saturday night . again we were seated in the bar area . one of the appetizer plates on our table had a thick glob of dried cheese on it . the hostess took it back and then brought me a `` clean '' plate . as she approached i saw her scraping something off it . she dropped it off and and i pushed it to the side and walked over to 3 empty table before i found plates w/ no dried on food on them . they must have issues w/ their dishwasher albeit human or machine . we sat there for 15 minutes , in that time , no one ever took our drink order or ever brought chips or water . as i looked around , again there were people standing around by the door leading to the patio doing nothing .... just standing around chit chatting . at this point i had enough . as we walked out , i turned around and decided to speak to the manager . when he finally came out , i told him that we had been there for 15 minutes and no one took our drink order , that he had a staff of people standing at the door doing absolutely nothing . he kinda of just stared at me w/ a deer in the headlights look . he never apologized , just stood there looking around . as you read other posts about this location , you will read about the other service issue . you would think this place being so new , they would want to hit it out of the park with every customer that walks thru their door . save your aggravation and money and head down the street to manuel 's or macayos !
0	a lot of my midwest friends rave about how good their burgers are , being from california i 've never had the opportunity to try one , until today . immediately i noticed the size of the bun , this thing is huge ! i enjoyed the burger and fresh ingredients , the bacon and jalape\u00f1o added a great touch to the burger . i guess i 'm spoiled in california with options such as habitat burger and burger city , i would not say this burger is better than in-n-out or fatburger , sorry friends . customer service was nice , i liked how the cashier comes to your table with all the different sauces you can have . tried the spicy ketchup , has a nice mini-sized kick too it .
1	butter burger ! ! the fries are the only thing holding this place back . onion rings are the way to go . i do n't venture out on the whole menu .
0	great service and decent food . the breakfast is the king here . be sure to get the pancakes .. also , they had the blackberry cobbler which is a must have . for dinner , i ordered the grilled catfish with baked apples , baked potatoes ( extra cost ) , and a side salad . the catfish was tasty and not over seasoned .
1	nice club . -no fat chicks -nice variety of girls -not too pricey i did see girl who looked like shrek . i told her i ran a school for mutants and can help her harness her power for the good on mankind . i can help you
0	consistent food . the mushroom soup is good .
1	tried this for lunch yesterday and we were n't disappointed ! we started with the pork larb salad and it was comparable to what we ate in bangkok . an amazing blend of spice and flavor . definately a top pick ! the thai iced tea cooled off the heat of the salad . i tried the three color curry and it had plenty of kick at a number four , fresh veggies and tender chicken , with just enough lime leaf . others tried the panang and yellow curries , but i was partial to mine . great service with an attentive wait staff .
1	i do n't care if this place is a chain or serves americanized ( aka not real ) chinese food ... i love it ! pf chang 's is a little pricey for chinese food , but hey ... it tastes good ! dishes are approximately $ 9- $ 14 ( according to my memory ) . i always order the dan dan noodles . this is by far the best dish they have ! the mushu pork is also pretty tasty and the servers even put the pancake and pork together for you ! now that 's service ! something you never get in an authentic chinese restaurant ! also , every meat dish comes with rice ! ( major points because americanized chinese places usually charge rice per person ... lame ! )
0	yeah . i am pretty much appalled at this store . the only reasons to shop here are the selection and prices . the turn-offs include : jerky employees - hard to put my finger on why this store attracts a weird breed of techno-jerk . head scratching security annoyances such as needing to always get a supervisor to determine if your cash is authentic . the stupid long lane of cashiers and having to wait to be told which counter to go to ... clearly the prices rock - so if you know exactly what you need and are pretty sure you will never need to go back for support , then it is worth a stop . personally , i prefer buying things from amazon.com to avoid paying the local taxes . shopping at frys is like brain-damage . i will pass if i can help it .
0	the food was pretty tasty , though nothing special . i had a salad that i could have gotten at pretty much any contemporary american restaurant . my friend had a sandwich that he declared `` high end deli-ish . '' the appetizers were actually the star of our meal - some kind of seared ahi/sesame concoction and seafood potstickers . they seem to be relying a lot on the organic schtik , which really only works if the raw ingredients are used artfully . in this case i think they are missing the boat . the mock-tails were fun ( but a lot of money for no hooch ) . added gin to the 2nd one and was much more satisfied . this actually probably would have been a 4 star experience except the service just flat out sucked . took 10 minutes for someone to bring waters and another 10 for the waiter to show up . i think they must have gotten their sections screwed up or something . sadly it never really improved . they do get brownie points for seriously sprucing up the old coffee plant though . nice atmosphere and gorgeous patio .
0	dr. schreiber is one of the worst doctors i have ever seen . he is extremely rude and condescending . he continually talks down to the patients and treats adults like children . there is a skin procedure that i get done once a year that had it done by dermatologist for the past 15 years . i had this procedure done by another doctor at this particular clinic . when i went back to get it done again dr. schreiber refused to do the procedure on me and forced me to see a specialist simply because of the fact that i 'm a minority . the next time that i made an appointment i called the office to see when my appointment was the girl went day by day look at everything that i did not have an appointment . two hours later another girl from the office called me to confirm the appointment for the next day . i showed up for my appointment at 10 am and they kept me waiting until 11:30 am . they had a cut out picture of pres . obama in the reception office with a sign on it saying look delays happen if you do n't like it 's leaving make another appointment . this is the worst medical facility ever ... run do n't look back
0	folks ... lets get real . its a chinese buffet . you get to pig out until you explode for less than 10 bucks . we all go into these places knowing its not gourmet . and we are all generally amused that they have options like pudding , enchiladas , mac n cheese and garlic bread . if your ideal evening is eating yourself into a coma and having explosive gas for about a day .... red wok will do the trick .
0	i give it one star because there is nothing smaller . it was an acrylic nail nightmare . i needed a new set . just moved to las vegas so i am trying different nail salons to find the one i like this best . this one was not it . when i walked in i was shocked ot say the least . i was expecting a nail salon but it was so much more . beauty supply , hair salon and nail salon , all in one ! the gentleman who did my set was nice ... although he spoke not a word even though i asked multiple questions considering i wanted my hair done as well . i requested a simple design . my grand daughter can do this one ... and she 's 9. the woman who came to paint my nails stayed on the phone for 10 minutes , while i sat and waited , with her sitting right in front of me at the manicure table . when she finally got done giggling and laughing on the phone she started painting my nails ... one stripe down the middle ... when i asked her to paint the whole nail ... she acted like i had just asked her to change the tire on my car ! ! then the design . the paint she used was way too thick ... and it clumped and curled on my nail ... then she put the topcoat on and smeared the whole thing ! ! when i pointed it out ... she said it only smeared `` a little '' . omgosh ... i 'm paying for a service .... not smears . on top of it ... there was nail polish all over my fingers . so i asked her to just take it off and paint my nails a solid color with no design . the world came to an end at that moment . she actually had the nerve to say , `` yes , the design looked good in the picture , but did n't look good on you '' insult much ? ? ! it was n't that it did n't look good on me ... it was that she did a horrible job ! ! so she goes to take the polish off and uses something really strong .... and it melted my new set of nails ! ! ! the gentleman had to come redo them ! by this time my fingers were burning ... and i complained . he told me to wash my hands ... so i did . the burning stopped . then the girl comes back to paint my nails one solid color ... and again ... one stripe down the middle . when i pointed it out again ... she said she 'd cover the rest on the second coat . wtheck ? ? i want two coats all over ... not one coat in 'spots ' . she finished the tragic job , then charged me full price ! ! when i complained about that ... they said ... '' new set 25.00 ! '' so i paid ... left and went to another salon and got my nails redone ! this was about a week ago . my fingers were sore for 4 days ! ! this place is unprofessional , and should not be allowed to be open to do nails . i do n't know about their other services ... but if this is how they treat first time customers .... run .... run fast , and do n't stop at this dump ! !
1	this is one of my favorite chinese buffet places and it 's pretty close to home so we come here fairly often . i came here on friday night with my husband and my toddler daughter . we were charged about $ 22.50 for two adult dinners ( baby is free ) and a hot tea for my husband ( just water for me and the baby . ) the host went out of his way to find a plastic spoon and fork for our little daughter ... i thought that was nice of him . their service is very friendly , and in fact i have always been treated extremely well by the staff every time we 've ever come . their service is so friendly and the food is so tasty that i actually rented out their private back room for my daughter 's 16th birthday party last year . the food was very good on this visit , and i really enjoyed the fried catfish , green beans , fried chicken , seafood delight , baked mussels and the char siu bao ( steamed pork buns ) . they also have a nice sushi offering and a nice salad bar and dessert selection although i did n't have anything from those cases on this visit . also , i 've never tried it so i do n't know how it is ; but they also offer mongolian bbq too . the only thing i would mention that was negative about this visit was that our table , while it appeared to be clean , was actually sticky . i 'm assuming it was wiped off with an already sticky rag . overall this is a good buffet . i would suggest them , as long as they make sure the tabletops are n't sticky .
0	wo n't be going back again . ordered ultimate with the sea food extras . server stopped by with shrimp one time . meats were over cooked and under seasoned . was not busy but waiter must have had too many tables as we had to wait for refills on drinks . the killer is they burned the pineapple . salad bar was so so . overall service and food was very disappointing .
1	i came here for breakfast on a sunday . we waited under 5 minutes for a table for 4. the service was great , and the food was really great . there were lots of different options for people 's tastes , and the presentations were very palatable .
0	i hate to do this to moki 's since they 've gotten such good reviews ahead of me , but i have to . first off , let me admit ; this is my first time eating hawaiian food , so maybe it 's just not my cup of tea . but , this food was horrid . moki 's is in the shopping center right next to where i work and i had seen it many times and it never looked busy so i thought , `` meh , must not be very good. '' . i came to yelp today to see what people thought and was surprised by all of the great reviews ! and since i was craving a teriyaki rice bowl-type lunch , i decided to give this place a shot . i called in ahead and ordered the combo plate with teriyaki beef and the kalua pork , both of which came recommended by previous reviewers . i ordered it with brown rice ( my attempt at being health conscious ) and the pasta salad . i was quoted 10 minutes and arrived right about then . the interior is just like any other strip mall restaurant . the girl working there was very nice . i got my food , paid and left ... really excited for the delicious food i was about to partake in ! when i got back in my car i noticed a smell . the smell was quite honestly , repulsive . it smelled like a body rotting in a a months worth of garbage . i 'm not even lying . it was n't super strong since the food was in a box and the box in a bag , but it was bad enough to make me question whether or not i would be able to eat it . i got back to work , sat down in the breakroom and opened up my meal . meh . it did n't really look very good . i first tasted the pasta salad and it was really lackluster . it did n't have much flavor at all , it just tasted like plain pasta and potatoes with a little ( very little ) mayo mixed in . next i tried the kalua pork . it was tender , no doubt about that , but completely flavorless . i kept wondering if maybe there was supposed to be a sauce on it that was forgotten . i could see spices but could n't taste anything . then i moved on to the teriyaki beef . at first glance i could see that it was dry . it tasted dry and again , had very little flavor . the brown rice was sitting in a pool of water , but at least it tasted like brown rice . i think the tastiest thing on the plate was the pineapple wedge . i ate one piece of the beef and a couple of bites of the pork and salad and rice and threw the meal away . what a waste of almost $ 10 . i was anything but impressed . oh and remember the smell i mentioned ? a co-worker came in the breakroom shortly after i threw the food away and immediately plugged her nose in disgust and said `` something smells horrible back here '' . i just kind of giggled and began to open my mouth when another co-worker said `` oh there was rotten brocolli that got thrown away earlier '' . i just left it at that . i did n't want to admit that i had just eaten food that smelled like rotten brocolli mixed with death and garbage . never again would i eat at moki 's .
0	i was so excited to get a shave i walked in & the lady working there did not even know i was there.when i asked about the shaves she did n't know anything & i made a appointment for monday & the barber does n't work on monday so why make a appointment for me then ? ? ? ? ?
0	i had the chicken sub . it was pretty bland , very little flavor .
1	has a great selection of foods for buffet that can cater to vegetarians and non-veg alike including standard dishes like paneer , naan and channa but also had unique dishes like indian-chinese , lamb and beef .
0	i have been here twice and i love it . the chicken was moist , the rice is white , the hummus is well seasoned , and the garlic sauce ( paste ) is hella garlic . the atmosphere during the day is casual . the tvs are on , but not too loud , there are plenty of tables and chairs . it 's a great place to have lunch .
0	this was my first and last time going here . i had a doctors appt in this area and decided to try the area . the lady named yen was who did my pedicure . i walked into salon and a guy did n't greet me he just said pick a color . i waited and the girl that did my feet did n't greet me either . she had a co-worker sit next to us the whole time making fun of the lady next to me and talking about me as well . i had to try and also get her name because she was n't going to volunteer it and there was a language barrier . definitely an unpleasant experience not worth the $ 25.00 . will never go back !
1	if you like chipotle , you should like foosia . it 's like a healthy asian twist on chipotle . fresh food , really nice staff who seem to want to make you happy . nice little porch to eat outside if you want . i 've been over 5 times and it is always good . interior and clean and modern .
1	great place to begin your las vegas adventure . 1.they have a superbly large variety of alcohol , personally one of the largest liquor stores i have ever stepped in . 2.they offer a knowledgeable and friendly service especially if you 're one of those new liquor connoisseur as well as having tasters . 3.beer , wine , and spirits they will most likely have your favorite poison in stock somewhere in there large store . 4. the prices are reasonable especially if you 're planning to party in sin city . note : beware , you might leave with more than what you walked in to purchase .
0	ce n'est pourtant pas la premi\u00e8re fois que je vais au boston pizza , mais c'est maintenant que je me d\u00e9cide \u00e0 faire un avis . les menus du midi valent la peine puisque peu chers et avantageux : salade et caf\u00e9 sont inclus . mais question sant\u00e9 on y repassera ( aucun choix sant\u00e9 sur les menus express , \u00e7a fait dur ! ) . en parlant du menu express .. 25 minutes pour se faire servir une pizza c'est un peu long , surtout lorsque le restaurant est quasi vide ... bon , fini le chi\u00e2lage , parlons des bons points ; ) le menu renferme des choix sant\u00e9s identifi\u00e9s par un crochet et qui nous informe sur les calories et autre \u00e9l\u00e9ments nutritionnels du plat . bonne id\u00e9e ! sinon , un \u00e9ventail de pizzas d\u00e9licieuses , des ribs , des p\u00e2tes , des entr\u00e9es d\u00e9licieuses , des salades gourmet , alouette ! mention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la tarte au sucre ... mmmm dans le genre de resto-bar sportifs , boston pizza surpasse les autres et de loin .
0	even though they have a play area , a tv and video games- there is not much space for waiting . constantly overbooked- children are running around unattended-touching other kids and scribbling on the walls . the front desk employes are standing around goofing off- there is complete lack of control in this place !
1	the service is a little slow at the end of the night but it is because the food is fresh . great environment . this is not a place to be in a rush .
0	i ordered a chicken sandwich plain . i told him plain at least 3 times . he said okay i will make sure its plain since it was not on the board . when i got home it was not plain . that really irked me . i think he is new but all he had to do is put it on the board and it would have been the way i wanted it .
0	hard to miss right when you walk in , this large and lively restaurant in the lobby of caesar 's has some pretty solid food choices for the picky and non-picky eater alike . during my stay i had the chance to enjoy all three meals ( breakfast , lunch and dinner ) . each meal was pretty standard , good enough to say that this restaurant has their stuff together in the food department . if you find yourself considering lunch at this restaurant i would recommend the chicken burger with curry mayonnaise . the only area where this restaurant lacks , and you can blame it on being in a very large hotel in las vegas with tons of people coming and going all the time , is the service . both at the bar and when sitting at a table we had to wait too long for our server to take our order and too long to bring us our food . i also witnessed many other patrons experiencing the exact same lack of attention . on a more positive note , this restaurant has a large bar with plenty of seating on both sides and it 's one of the cheaper restaurants within caesar 's palace .
1	my mexican family loves tacos . my mom makes tacos at home all the time and we have gone to at least 15 different taco places in nevada . i am so sick of tacos and hate eating them ... but .. this place is the only exception . this place is the best taco place in nevada . these tacos are like no others . they are just so delicious . the `` el pastor '' tacos are to die for . these are incredibly good . i usually get 3 el pastor tacos .. they are a bit spicy and they come with creme yum yum m getting so hungry thinking about them . i 've had carne asada tacos .. which are very good . the tacos de lengua ( beef tongue ) are sooo good too . these are my moms favorite . dont be afraid to try it because it sounds strange . the tacos `` de sesos '' have to be my second favorite . yummy these are my dad 's favorite . i love them all but just the el pastor tacos are worth going . they also have `` aguas frescas '' they have horchata which is delicious and i always get it and they have others .. there is one drink that taste like oranges and creme which is super good too .
1	a family friend gave me a gift certificate for a free haircut with damian . i 'm broke , i 'm a teacher , i like free stuff and my hair was in a mighty sad state . i called and made an appointment for the next day . whoever answered the phone was friendly and accomodating and gave me excellent directions to the shop . when i arrived at the shop the next day , i was a little unsure . snapdragon is in a nondescript , mostly vacant office complex . it is in the back part of the complex and has no street visibility or signage . in fact , aside from a for lease sign on the front of the building there is no signage at all . but , again , i 'm broke , a teacher and my hair sucked . so i parked and walked in . the minute i opened the door my worries were completely wiped away . the shop is small , intimate , well decorated , warm and welcoming . the staff was friendly and greeted me with an offer of a beverage ( i opted for the wine ) . after a couple minute wait ( i was early ) , damian fetched me from the comfy couch and brought me back to his station . he was friendly and funny without being pushy or obnoxious . he took time to talk to me about my `` hair history '' and what i wanted to do today . he was sure to ask me not just about length but style too ( rock and roll or classic and conservative ) . i was just there for a cut but we also discussed color options for a future visit and i was glad to learn we were on the same page with our ideas . i was ready for a change so i let him cut off about 4-5 inches of my hair . this is a big deal for a first time client experience . damian delivered . he took his time and made sure everything was perfect before he let me out of the chair . i love my hair , my mom loves my hair , my boyfriend loves my hair and my students love my hair . snapdragon uses bumble and bumble products which i ca n't afford so to me that was a luxiourous treat . i like this little shop . i believe they also have a manicurist , but not sure about aesthetician services . i 'll be back in a month or two for another cut and color !
0	i had to walk out the moment i walked in . sadly the customer service lead me to not even offer my business . a woman who i am assuming was an owner or manager was extremely rude . the shop was slow with only three clients . without even greeting me me or a simple `` hello . '' i was asked what i wanted ? i asked for a polish change and how long of a wait . she said pick a color . when i mentioned i had a color with me . she rolled her eyes and said `` 8.00 '' i asked her if there would be a wait and she mentioned few mins just sit down . then proceeded to speak in another language under her breathe to the other employees who started staring . i decided to leave because i do n't treat people like this why should i even give my business to a place that runs theirs very snooty . the establishment was clean and very cute inside just the way that it operates is not professional .
0	on my trip to vegas , my friends raved about this place so we stopped by on sunday afternoon . while the service was super friendly and the prices were great , i ca n't say that i was impressed at all . first they brought us the cornbread that 's like a griddle cake , super thin and sweet . not terrible but nothing special . i got the smothered fried chicken , cabbage and yams . i 've never had smothered chicken and i do n't know why i decided to try it that day , but i wish i had left that nasty brown gravy off of otherwise decent fried chicken . the cabbage was so bland , i could n't even finish it . the yams were super sweet , as if they were only seasoned with white sugar . i do n't think this place was terrible , like i said the customer service was prompt and friendly and the prices were very good . but the food could be better if it was seasoned better .
0	bad ! took a friend from out of town too . we wanted detox bath & reflexology but , owner tried to talk us out of it to a body massage & mask ( said worked better ) i said no that 's not what we wanted . during the detox bath the machine did n't work & leaked all over the floor & they did n't give us full 30 min of detox bath because of problem & they cheated us 10 min of reflexology . we wo n't be back ! ! ! ! they do n't like to give good service or care about their business ! waste of time & money !
0	i waited till my third visit to write a review on agave . going to agave is probably like dating a ditzy supermodel : looks fantastic . gorgeous ! inside and out , day or night . this spot tricks you into thinking you are not in vegas ... and the patio is cute , cute , cute ! very sweet . yummy desserts and margs ( cucumber cilantro gets my vote ) . embarassingly slow . all three visits . this last time , we sat at 6 , food arrived at 7:14. seriously ? lacks substance . entrees are just ok , def not worth the pricing . white corn chips are horrid ( stick to the blue ones ) . agave is a great spot to take someone for a drink ( you will score bonus points ) , but eat somewhere else .
0	had a lovely kale caesar salad with chicken . flavors were good , but chicken was slightly overdone and salad was overdressed . loved the ambiance and our server was terrific ! think her name was marcela . yummy flavored shaved ices for dessert !
1	so i finally made it to the new shop . its so pretty inside and of course there are all kinds of new items . now that the store is bigger they are able to offer more services . my son was excited to pick out a new toy for his grandma 's dog and of course get love from dozer and princess pebbles . dee and kevin always make you feel welcome and your treated like a friend . not just a customer . and their pack of dogs are always well behaved . i bet those dogs live a better life then most people . there shop is definitely worth checking out .
1	what ? ! no one 's yelped them yet ? ! alright then ... good little museum . right now , they 've put together a new exhibit to commemorate the century mark for clark county . they 've also got a steam locomotive and `` the outdoor classroom '' , a walking trail where all the local flora have been classified with signs . they 've set up `` heritage street '' , with more than a half dozen buildings that have been moved to the site and outfitted with appropriately period interior accoutrement . i really like this kind thing , but i can see how the less historically-inclined might be bored . they 've done an admirable job , but you can tell the funding 's a little short because several the the rooms need repair . so the moral of the story is , throw 'em a couple extra bucks to preserve the local history . i 'd really like to see them renovate their newest aquisition , the little wedding chapel . once that 's done , they 'll be a great place to have wedding ceremonies ( likely , on the cheap , too , considering it 's a county site )
1	this is the 2nd time we 've been here ... the yard is a sam fox enterprise consisting of culinary dropout and cleo 's ... we have been to the scottsdale location but much prefer the phoenix one due to atmosphere and attitude of the servers . again we had a very good experience and after eating spent the afternoon playing ping pong at the tables .. no charge , just a drivers license . the pretzel fondue is yummy and really anything on their menu would probably be good . sam fox does not disappoint !
0	i hate to say it but i agree with the other users . the cupcakes we received from a groupon were very bland , small , and not up to par with grocery store cakes or cupcakes .
1	well , love gordon and the restaurant is so good , but to just go to have a drink ... bring you f * ucking earplugs cause , sans dance floor why is the music so loud ? ? ? ? really gordon , fix it now !
1	really great espresso drinks . the latte ( perfect balance of espresso , milk , and foam ) is my personal favorite but their regular coffee is very good , as well . the coffee is full-bodied with a good aroma . it 's a good place to people-watch , if you can find outdoor seating on a warm day . prices are pretty inexpensive , too .
0	the food is awful for the amount of money they charge . it would still be awful if they charged less . the service is ok and the atmosphere is nice but it is all ruined by the large group of extremely cranky and overly opinionated senior citizens who seem to think we are eating at their home . i will not be coming back to this station buffet .
1	as a longtime lover of kiss i was totally thrilled when this opened . my husband and i went yesterday and i was thrilled with the entire experience ! ! every member of the staff was awesome with great smiles and great attitude . the gift shop was stocked with various merchandise to suit every price point . the music of course was the best with song that rarely get play time on the radio . the mini golf course was filled with awesome graphics and helpful staff . during out time there several contest were held . the restrooms were very clean . i would recommend this for the entire family and non kiss fans ! !
0	worst sushi ever ! just ate lunch here today and i could not finish my food . i am pretty sure the fish had gone bad . really disappointed because i was looking forward to sushi today . service was mediocre and there was only one other person in the restaurant . ( that should have been a sign on a saturday ) would not eat here again .... now off to let my tummy heal : (
0	so over priced and extremely small portions . the waitress made us table side guacamole and it was inedible because she put so much lime in it . also , my friend and i sat at the table and chatted for about 20 min and the waitress kept walking by with an evil eye . the place was n't busy nor was it close to closing time . i would n't recommend eating here . so many other great mexican places . also the website does n't show a menu .
1	came here on a recommendation for a fresh breakfast . i ordered the chipotle breakfast burrito and a flourless peanut butter muffin . really good burrito ! the chipotle sauce was really good and they were generous with the avocado . i often opt for egg whites which sometimes makes my food soggy , this did n't happen here . i 'll definitely be coming back here soon !
0	i had low standards for the arizona charlie 's buffet and they were still unable to meet them . ethnic food variety : 3 stars . they do have sushi ( looking scary ) , asian dishes , mexican dishes and typical american type food . food quality : 1 star . if there was a negative star option , i would chose that . the food looks like it is 5+ hours old and previously chewed . the fish was like salmon-jerky . service : 4 stars . i never went without a refill . price : 25+tip for sunday dinner for two people ... not exactly a bargain . the good : i was able to stick to my healthy diet because everything looked so old and dried out i decided just to have a salad , refried beans and a chocolate cupcake .
0	why lord do they put corn in mac n cheese ? its mac n cheese . the staff are omg ... listen people ok. the staff are rude and the food is just ok. if your looking to break up with someone and u do n't care about standers come here . its like a joke ... i kept thinking am i being punked ? if this place was in my home town they would not be in business because in memphis we know what real bbq is . i ate samples of a lot of everything . the only good bbq that they cook are the little wing dings . all the other meats were dried out and half of the meat they did n't even put bbq sauce on the meat they bring u old mustard jars with they own bbq sauce and they expect you to fix your own bbq what a joke . its not bbq if they did n't apply the sauce while it was on the grill . i give it one star because they went out of they way to earn it . i will try to check out different locations because its titled famous daves and i would like to see what is so famous about dave .
1	francais apr\u00e8s one of my favorite summer in my life , beign part of the pointe-claire yatch club ... i needed a floating vest and decided to go close and help out a little independant strore instead of pushing money in atmosph\u00e8re or mec . they do have amazing selection and i would have to say that if you 're into outdoor , specifically kayak , canoe , you 're at the right place . very very knowledgable staff . it has a very west-island taste to it . kind of speaking franglais with the guy and nobody was wondering if it was wrong or not ! ahahah . they 've been there since forever and they only hold top quality gear and clothing . they have like no cheap option . for the outdoor enthousiast it 's a breath of fresh air to get in a place with zero crap ! . they sell second hand fully restored canoe and kayak that are way cheaper ! so you can make really good deals there ! c'est un de mes \u00e9t\u00e9s favoris \u00e0 vie : \u00catre membre du pointe-claire yatch club pour m'initi\u00e9 \u00e0 la voile . j'avais besoin d'une veste de sauvetage pour mon size ( genre 55 de torse : yup big man ! ) . puis j'ai toujours envie d'aller aider le petit ind\u00e9pendant kit \u00e0 pay\u00e9 10 $ de plus , je m'en fou . atmosph\u00e8re n'avait pas vraiment la qualit\u00e9 ou ce que je recherchais . mec non plus pis c'est \u00e0 tombouktouche quand t'habites dans l'ouest de montr\u00e9al alors camp de base \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour m'aider et puis le staff est juste tr\u00e8s connaissant et puis tr\u00e8s gentil . on parlait franglais , y ' a d\u00e9finitivement une atmosph\u00e8re tr\u00e8s ouest de l'ile dans ce magasin du vieux pointe-claire . ils sont localis\u00e9 l\u00e0 depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps et leur location est juste parfaite : a deux pas du pointe claire yatch club et \u00e0 5 minutes d'auto de celui de lachine . particuli\u00e8rement agr\u00e9able en \u00e9t\u00e9 . le magasin est juste un endroit superbe pour les fan de plein-air et plus particuli\u00e8rement , les fans de plein-air aquatique . on y vend des canots , des kayaks et m\u00eame des embarcations de seconde main remise \u00e0 neuf . une fa\u00e7on d'\u00e9conomis\u00e9 g\u00e9niale pour l'amateur qui \u00e0 un budget mais qui recherche de la performance niveau \u00e9quipement . contrairement aux grand magasin , parce que l'endroit n'est pas tr\u00e8s grand , on y retrouve que du top qualit\u00e9 . sans contredit , une belle place !
1	yolanda keeps me looking fresh . the best barber in town . come and check it out . everyone is awesome ! the shop is always clean .
1	this company is fast , reliable , and reasonable . im a real estate agent so having immediate access to a computer , printer and scanner is my life line . two of our office computers had a virus and copier/printer/scanner was down . i called icu from a promotion they had on another site , they came the same day and resolved all of our issues within a couple of hours . their price was shockingly fair compared to other companies we 've used in the past . im usually hesitant when a company charges by the hour but i could tell icus objective is to get the job done quickly and efficiently . i would recommend them to anyone that needs computer repair .
0	this review is more about aaa as a company then the employees who work there . i just moved here and in a haste purchased auto and homeowners insurance from them.after i had a moment to settle in to my new home i started to look around at competing insurance companies.aaa is over priced . i cancelled my policy and have now been waiting 3 weeks for my prorated premiums to be returned to me.dont you just love these companies that take forever to pay back but if your one day late your cancelled ? i also found their process of accessing my risk , biased and unfair . i would not reccomend this company for anything.the aaa membership is antiquated and obsolete.1 extra star was given for the employees , otherwise would have been 1 .
0	danny 's use to be the premier car wash place . i 've used this location since it open ( 8-10 years not sure ) . anyway , today was my last visit . got there at 10:20 not very busy . told them i had to be out the door by 11:15 , they said absolutely no problem . car did n't leave oil change until 11:15 and sat in front for 10 min . went in to complain and was told all they could do was give me a voucher to come back for the car wash. no one went out to say hey let 's get this guys car through . car finally came through and it was cleaned by a guy with an ankle bracelet , unsupervised . now it is 11:40 i am leaving get in the car . radio is filthy . air freshner i paid for was not used . i called since i am 30 min away from my 11:45 appt . asked to speak with a manager . after 14 min on hold i hung up . the only thing i can conclude is they just care about money . they try to upsell you on everything . they lie to get your business . they should of said no ca n't do oil change in that time period , and i would of come back . instead they 've lost a customer for life . use to be a great place to go ....
0	first , i love teppanyaki restaurants . it is always a fun time introducing new people to those type of restaurants . benihana was my second choice , but option a was closed . being a chain , i knew i had a good shot it would still be in business . i prefer the smaller restaurants - typically more entertainment and lower cost , but benihana is typically good and it is open . there were 3 chefs working yesterday and we got the white guy . he was nice , but he was n't as good as the ones at the other tables . this is n't him , because the other chefs did n't do it either , but there was no volcano like every other teppanyaki place does and no big flame to clean the grill . probably being a chain they are more worried about law suits resulting from fire . instead of volcano with flame , it was a train with smoke . benihana is more expensive than other places , but considering it is like dinner and a show , it is n't bad . the show part was not as good as it could be . the chef was okay and for the first timers with me , they thought it was good . the flavor of the food was okay , but not the best i have had . it was just kind of ho-hum for me . interestingly enough after he was finished with our table , the chef went to another table that was all asian customers . i wondered to myself what they must think getting the one white guy in the place - then the loud clanking noise of him dropping the cart and the food on the ground told me they probably were n't impressed . for 2 people ordered one of the standard combos and water , it was $ 65 ( $ 80 after tip ) . a little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food . i would recommend finding a smaller local establishment . at least they usually throw shrimp at you and douse you with saki if you catch it .
0	someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down . a large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful . the stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel . the cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can and there was nothing special about the bread . the upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot .
1	very yummy breakfast . the wait staff is very friendly and made the experience even better !
0	run - do n't walk to another wells fargo branch . i 've banked with them for at least 20 years - this is by far the worst in management , customer service , ease of service , etc . i prefer the one further up w. charleston or lake mead - wo n't stick my head in here , ack !
