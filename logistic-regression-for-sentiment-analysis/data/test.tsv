1	i had an excellent experience with this company . they came out for a no pressure estimate and explained all of my options and the pricing . then they were patient while i decided and even had them re-quote different styles for me . they under-promised and over-delivered , which is great . they estimated three weeks and my gate was installed in one .
1	it 's a pretty hole in the wall at the tempe marketplace . i wish they 'd be a little more consistent with their flavor selection . sometimes you feel like a mint and sometimes you do but they do n't have it on that particular visit , meh . i digress from my 4-star rating . the yogurts good , the topping selection is better , and more consistent , and the staff is as friendly as can be . only thing i 'd change is its location in front of the child trap water pit where it seems like every time i visit , there 's a toddler running around sans a diaper .
0	very up-to-date hotel . pleasant atmosphere . make sure if you want 3g/4g access in your room that you stay on the west side . pool has horrible hours imho . if you want wifi access , be prepared to spend a fortune . drinks at the pool are outrageously priced ! $ 17 for one drink ( includes mandatory tip )
1	lets see , locally used organic fresh ingredients with 2 business owners that met in the industry and have a combined 30 yrs . in the kitchen ! i 'm a foodie , so off i go to flipside cafe , btw its only been open 1 week ! so i originally wanted to have breakfast/brunch , but i was told that it was lunchtime . so i stayed and had lunch , wow ! ! ! ! i did n't expect to be knocked off the proverbial ladder . i had the special , bbq chicken sandwich and pan roasted potatoes . it did n't appear to be much as the chicken and the ingredients seemed to have gotten lost inside that awesome buttery/garlic brioche bun . wait for it -- flavor city 101 ! ! in the time i was there i witnessed a very new business owner , amy , i did n't get a chance to meet jon , run the front of the restaurant w/ tireless enthusiam . out of the 7 people , including myself , these were the items ordered : 3 chicken sandwiches , 1 hamburger , 1 open faced turkey plate , 1 turkey chili , and 1 shrimp ( soy ) chorizo and grits . everyone was asked how they enjoyed the food , and the overall consensus was on par w/ my opinion . thumbs way up , awesome , the best i 've had , one person just shook their head and gave two thumbs up . bravo flipside cafe , you 're on the way to a bigger location , sooner than expected ! my name is d'shawn and will definitely be going back to visit !
0	east valley family medical is a joke , the wait time is hours ( one time i waited 4 hours after my appointment time to finally be seen by doctor ) . the doctors are rushed , they do n't ask questions , do n't listen , do n't provide information . they act and groan and scoff like they 're pissed they have to do their job . you wait hours to see a doctor and he sees you for 60 seconds . they 're not gay friendly ( or people friendly period ) . they do n't do any refills over the phone of any kind under any circumstances , if you need a refill you need to make another appointment and they just increased their office visit fee from 50 to 65 bucks . not happy . not even a little .
0	i was going to go with meh , 2 stars , because that 's how i feel , but the gal behind the bar deserves a couple stars all her own . 8 $ for a small shot of jameson ? alright , i guess i 'll allow it since we 're in an old stone room in the old port . this vibe should have been cozy and right up my alley but left me feeling all businessny aaaand shrug . my charming companion ordered the popcorn sweetbreads and they were a bit greasy and flavourless - but these were comp 'd when the waitress saw her sad shrug , so i reiterate : much love for the service , but something else here is definitely missing .
0	this cvs drives me bananas . first of all , i think cvs is setup to be slow and crappy . one line , one person working who has no idea how to use the register , horribly high non-sale item prices , bad lightening , old school ( and not in a good way ) layout , etc . that being said , i continue to go there because of it 's proximity to my workplace . basically , i have no choice . which brings me to the pharmacy . while i have no one to blame but myself when i go into buy a candy bar and it takes 20 minutes to check out ( see paragraph above ) i have a higher standard when it comes to the pharmacy . there are literally 10 billion people working back there ( ok , maybe 6 ) and yet they can not get it together . i have literally waited in line inside for 30 minutes with a baby in my arms as snot ran down my blouse ( from my nose , not the baby 's , i was the sick one ) and only one person is working the counter and the drive thru while 5 other people chat about their vacation plans ( seriously ! ) and fill prescriptions . i took note of this issue and next time i used the drive thru , as the baby was sleeping and they seem to favor the drive thru to the people waiting inside . when i got to the front they told me my prescription , which had been called in 6 hours prior , was not ready . wtf , cvs ? totally unacceptable . i demanded it immediately and told them i would not move my vehicle until i received my medication . after all , it was a zpack . grab the box and throw it at me . no `` filling '' required . ugh . i will do almost anything to avoid this cvs .
1	i 'm trying to save up some cash so it 's beginning to be with worrying regularity that i find myself in here . as much as i loathe greggs , there is something about their fatty , greasy , lukewarm filth that makes me keep coming back , and back , and back . it 's these life-shortening savouries , rather than the mediocre sarnies i used to prefer , that ensure my begrudged but repeated custom . that , and the maple pecan slice , a real diamond in the rough .
1	this was my first experience with gunnel 's . i had them put in firestone hd airbags and an on board compressor system for my work truck . set me back $ 800 out the door but those bags were exactly what i needed . gunnel 's could n't get me in for about 5 days but they did exactly what they said they would and they did it on time . looks like they did a good job too ! i 'm a happy camper , and my truck will be happy to not be dragging the bumper with my trailer .
0	limited beer actually available on tap . hell , i could slap a sticker on a tap and call it whatever i wanted to , does n't make it true . even if they did have all of the beer they claimed , it 's still not enough to call it a `` world '' of beer . seriously limited in supply and variety . our group headed up the street to another establishment after only one round and found better selections .
0	after seeing all the 2nd pasta helping commercials on tv , my boyfriend and i decided to have italian for date night . we were seated promptly upon arrival but noticed an odd smell coming from the dining room . the wood burning grill was close to where we were seated but it smelled off . our server was slow to arrive for drink orders and my boyfriend kept having to drink my water because our server neglected to fill water . i ordered a glass a wine , which of course was delicious . bread came and was honestly the best thing we ate all night . i loved the olive oil and spice mixture ! i ordered the pasta carraba and a caesar salad . the salad was really over-dressed and the dressing had quite a peppery kick . i like pepper but not overpowering . for the 2nd pasta helping , there were only 3 options and none of them resembled the pasta on the commercial . the pasta i ordered was very disappointing , very mushy . the chicken was grilled nicely but for $ 15.50 , the pasta was n't prepared better than what i could have made at home for a lot cheaper . we skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home . i did like that we were given bread , olive oil and spice mixture ( since that was delicious ) . it has been a while since i had visited carraba 's and now i know why . everything was mediocre and for me , i do n't like visiting places that are just ok .
1	let me take you through my stay ... check in : terrible ! i 'm sure it would n't be any different at other hotels on the strip , but waiting in line for 30 minutes when there 's only 3 people in front of us , at 9pm at night .... not cool . room : awesome ! we got a 2 bedroom suite and it was amazing ! the view was of the casear 's many pools , which are beautiful ! the living room and dining area were huge , as was the master bedroom ( ours ) , with two bathrooms which were connected by the shower .. pretty cool . i will say , for the money , we probably did n't spend enough time in the room to get a suite next time . shopping : if you 're like me and not that into gambling your money away , check out the forum shops . there 's everything from express and banana republic , to guess by marciano , on up to gucci , dolce & gabana and more . room service : eh . we tried ordering breakfast one morning and after being put on hold for 20 minutes , were told the wait was an hour and a half . ummm , nope . spa : i 'll do a separate review for this , so check it out . it was amazing ! overall : one of the nicer hotels i 've stayed at in vegas . i 've been several times and have stayed at new york new york , rio and bally 's . i would definitely stay here again . it offers easy access to the strip and is situated a convenient spot on the strip .
1	went in on a tuesday night , very busy , so recommend reservations ( though there were a few open spots at the bar for those of you looking for something last minute ) . there were five of us , so were able to order quite a few plates ( i 'd recommend doing this if you could ) . here 's what we had , all were very good , and we 've already made reservations for next week ... -pig candy : pork belly with kimchi . -mac & cheese : ohhhhhhhhh ... this was soooo good . must try , even if you do n't like mac & cheese . -roasted brussel sprouts : yum ! -shishito peppers : very good . not hot but a little bit of spice . -mussels : did n't try them myself ( not a fan ) but the others said they were very good . my main entree was the dirty pasta ( pasta with rabbit meat ) . also very good ! also , if you are a whiskey drinker , this place is heaven . the bar has a ceiling high display with various selections . price was n't too bad ... averaged $ 50/person but that included each person averaging a tapas plate , a main entree and a couple of drinks .
0	smith 's has some very good things about it and other aspects that are downright horrible . let 's start out with the good . i love their cold cut selections . although it is pricey , the taste is awesome . they also have an extensive output of bird seed ranging from dried meal worms to unhulled sunflower seeds . there are bird feeders and houses for sale . their natural food/health section is decent and much more economical than rainbow 's end down the street . one can find dietary supplements , gluten-free foods , all natural sugar substitutes ( e.g . brown rice syrup and agave nectar ) , vegan ice creams ( e.g . soy , rice and coconut ) , avocado oil potato chips , and chocolate bars made with sustainable chocolate . sometimes they run wild sales and one can find steals on durable pet beds and outdoor furniture . the alcohol selection 's extensive for a non-liquor store , and they have some of the lowest prices for a grocery store off vegas blvd . one can find import and specialty beers , a broad assortment of wines and decent liquor options like tequila , whiskey , vodka and the usual suspects . they close at 1 a.m. and open at 6 a.m. so if you want to have a last call or pull an all-nighter , it can be done . now , onto the bad ... customer service is sketchy . it is not uncommon to catch employees slacking off at work . i have seen deli employees eating in the deli counter in front of customers . that is wrong on so many levels . when i brought this to the employee 's attention , she brushed me off . i had to contact management and only he acknowledged that this was wrong . some of my family works in the food industry and if they were caught doing that , they would be written up in no time . besides this , customer service overall is bleh . if you can check out in peace , that 's the best you can hope for . smith 's poultry is sometimes sold rotten judging by the rotting flesh odor that permeates some chicken packages . i have seen meat selling past the sell-by date . i had to notify the meat packer of this , and his attitude was blase . no apology , nothing . more interestingly , i have come across rotten meat that is within the sale date . this makes me wonder if temperature abuse is taking place . before i became aware of this , i noticed that their chicken did not always sit well with us and could not pin point why . a word of caution : keep an eye on smith 's prices . sometimes their sale prices do not show up when you check out ( even with the discount card ) and have to tell them so .
1	quite frankly , i think i was hispanic during my past life or something because i absolutely loveeeeee mexican food ! now you cant really find authentic mexican food around this area but this place is pretty legit . definitely recommend the steak tacos and brisket nachos ! ! yum !
0	my coworkers from slc kept raving about this place one day , saying it was the best mexican food you 'll ever find . i was in the neighborhood today , so i gave it a shot . they asked if i had ever been there before , i said no . they gave me a sample of their pork . pork is supposed to be good because you have good quality meat and do a good job cooking it , not because you slopped on too much sugary sauce . it was almost like they were trying to hide the taste of the meat . settled on cheese enchiladas . was given the choice of mild , medium , or hot sauce . i love spicy stuff , so of course the choice was obvious . my diet dr. pepper had more of a kick . the food quality was ok. i finished everything , so it was n't horrible . it was very bland , however . the final kicker was the price . nearly $ 10 for two enchiladas and a soda ( none of the add-ons that than discussed , either ) ? come on , really ? the pluses are that the employees were very friendly and did their job well , and the restaurant was clean and well decorated for this type of place ( think along the lines of a rubio 's or taco del mar ) . when i visit seattle and order mexican , this is the type of food i expect . but this is arizona . there 's much better mexican food around here .
1	the food was so delicious ! we ordered 5 pasta dishes and i large pizza ! the service was even better ! we all left full and happy and do n't leave without trying the gelato .
1	delicious ! ! there 's no other word for it ! ! if you 're into asian cuisine then this is the place you 'll want to go to . their noodles are nothing short of delicious - you know how sometimes you get bored half way through your chow mein ? well not these noodles . i want to try the sesame chicken fried rice following amy 's recommendation , but i have no doubt that it will be delicious . the remaining star is lost because the price was a bit hefty , and i was told that i had to go and collect it myself .... which i did n't mind because i had a car but i would have been really miffed if i had n't .
0	this is the first time i 've eaten here . before this was called wok in . great food and owner was amazing . this here is a complete and utter dissapointment . the food lacks everything decent . orange chicken well over cooked . the pad thai flavorless . the singapore noodle flavorless and lacking most if the ingredients that you expect to find in this dish . 2 stars is being nice and giving this establishment a chance .. but or now , i 'll stick with the place that sells dumplings that are little off of stephanie and horizon .
0	when did they get rid of their stamp cards ? i have been gone for far too long . that 's not the only thing that has changed . i remember coming here often back in high school . were my taste buds just off or have they changed ? i had the honey lemon green tea with aloe vera about a month ago , was n't bad but did n't taste like how i last remember it . during my most recent visit , i got jasmine milk tea . i expected your average jasmine milk tea ... but it came out way too sweet and powdery . i did n't end up finishing the drink , and that never happens .
1	nice clean restaurant and really really fresh food . everything is made to order from when you order , and brought out to your table . there is no waiter service , it 's walk up , order and delivery to the table . i 'll go back .
0	this is a great option to border grill at mandalay bay . the food was decent and the prices were a bit lower than other places . it 's a casual atmosphere with friendly service . i would surely go again for quick and cheap eats .
0	awful . i 've frequented the serendipity 's in new york many times and this location is nowhere near in comparison . to start , we had to wait at least 15 minutes on a weekday at 2pm for two people . there were plenty of empty tables inside and outside . the problem seemed to be that they lacked enough staff to actually clear and clean the tables as soon as patrons left . while we waited for our table , we stood outside and perished the menu posted on the wall . was looking forward to trying their sundae with the humble pie . as soon as we sit down inside and look at the menu , we realize the menu is n't the same . i asked the waiter where the sundae was on the menu and he tells me that they do n't make humble pie anymore and that the menu outside is old and they have n't bothered to change it . disappointed , i order a cookie sundae and my friend orders the frozen hot chocolate - something she had been looking to try the whole trip . the deserts come quickly . her dessert is much smaller than the one they have in nyc . my sundae is mediocre . basically just cookie dough ice cream and a cookie . 5 minutes after serving our desserts , our waiter comes and drops off the bill basically preventing us from ordering anything else . needless to say i wo n't be frequenting this location again . it 's not worth the hype - nothing like the movie . john cusack and kate beckinsale would definitely not approve !
0	overpriced over-the-counter candy . also , my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy ( she 's 2 years old ) and started fiddling with the containers . not banging around , not throwing . she would take them out of the box then put them back in . yes , it 's probably mildly annoying . but she 's 2 , and it is a candy store . employee came and reprimanded her .
1	i literally have not been here for years but my cousin is in town and she wanted a california roll . lol . so i thought of ra because i knew it would n't be overly expensive and hunnie bunnie was rollin with us . we got there before happy hour was over , and we were sat in the dining room . i ordered the white sake sangria was was very tasty . angie had her california roll which she seemed to love and we shared some shishito peppers and spicy sesame chicken wings and edamame . everything was great ! hunnie bunnie had some miso soup and a big ass bowl of udon noodles . the only things is , if the udon noodles had broth in it , it would have been a little better i think but otherwise , no complaints ! i used to come here all the way waaaaaaaaaaaay back for happy hour - it 's a great spot on the strip for some cheap , good eats , and the service was good as well . niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice like iiiiiiiiiiiiiice ! ! !
0	we 've been coming here for years . it is a bargain if you have the coupons that are available in the mail or online . the past couple times , i have noticed a downward trend of quality . recently , some items were added to the `` upgrade '' section . for almost $ 11 for dinner , i would rather pay an extra buck & just have as much chicken as we want . not for $ 2.49 & only one 3 or 4 oz serving ! the soups are fairly good quality . the chowder & the potato leek soup alone made a star on the review . the pasta dishes have dropped badly in quality . fazoli 's had better pasta - and that is a fast food place ! i would like to see a return to basics on their pasta . what 's the use of sausage & peppers if you can not get the pasta right ? for a salad bar restaurant , sweet tomatoes has a very poor selection of fruit . watermelon , pineapples , & cantaloupe should be standard , plus maybe one or two others . they had bananas and apples ! wow how imaginative for the price we paid . not . the selection of hot tea is quality . two different red tea selections . the pomegranate green tea was tasty . btw , it is the republic of tea company , not lipton or nestea . jason 's deli does offer a better salad , where a soup can be bought for $ 1 . maybe we will give sweet tomatoes another chance in a few months . but it is no longer the go-to place it once was .
1	i have to say , as much beef as is eaten in vegas i am surprised cows are n't extinct yet ... there are steakhouses everywhere of varying quality . i really dug this one . the bone-in ribeye was just about the best steak i have had in this town , the waiter 's wine recommendation was spot-on , and the service was impeccable . one thing i noticed , and this separates the good from the great . no service person approached us when we were chewing . that 's the worst , being asked a question when your mouth is full . i 'd think it was a coincidence , but i saw the manager walking toward us just as i took a bite , and he obviously diverted to another table ... a minute later he stopped by and asked us how everything was . that 's cool .
1	i seem to be fond of this place although for a sub it 's a little pricier than regular but hey it floats my boat so i am good . right when you walk in the staff welcomes you .. they are n't soggy like other places i have been too . actually has a little bit of sweetness . maybe it is because of the wheat . if you go i would recommend that you try hook and ladder or smoke house beef and cheddar brisket plus the pop machine is amazing you have lots of options for pop .
0	the sushi is dry , the service was okay , the manager/owner kept on `` looking over our shoulders '' like a hawk though out the entire time we were eating . my friend told me once that it was rude to stare at people while they were eating and that always stuck with me . if you have a party of 4 and over tipping is included- 4 and over ? ! if the quality was good and the owner did n't have such a bad attitude i 'd be willing to recommend this to my buddies and understand the amount of people required to automatically tip 18 % . overall , this is an establishment that i would n't want to support , and that is why i 'm writing this review . besides the unreasonable owner , bad sushi ( the salmon tasted like rubber with uniformed cut up bite sizes , wtf ? ! i didnt like it ) , rude experience , we should have heeded the warning when two customers left without eating . probably because the wait was so long to get their food . hikari , no go ! sushi mon is more better , more flavor !
1	they take 14 days to brine their corned beef . enuff said . . . . oh , okay , here 's some more : 1. friend had the fish and chips but said they were n't memorable enough to rave about them . 2. though friend did have the snake bite and said it was 'awesome ! ' 3. but we both agree that the corned beef alone warrants a return visit . 4. and the waitresses are irish ! love their accents !
1	it 's one of the few classics that does n't fade away . i just had the pastrami sandwich the other day and it was excellent ! i have not had a good pastrami sandwich since old ebbitt 's grill in washington , dc . this sandwich was pretty darn close . on top of the one of a kind decor , elvis was having lunch at the same time ! this place is still top notch !
1	i 'm definitely a fan of the groves . you can bring your dog and relax outside . a main reason i go is to see the server , levi . he is so friendly and funny . he makes you feel like you are visiting his home and you have been friends forever . i recommend the buffalo chicken salad .
1	i like this place for the food and reasonable prices . it is nice to take a couple steps away from the casino and have a good meal . the staff is always helpful and breakfast is really good . i recommend the protein breakfast .
1	very nice and grassy park- i wish the seating would get washed down more often or some bleacher type seating was installed- but over all very nice- people usually pick up after their dogs here .
0	decent small plates restaurant in town square . their menu has a few similar items as their sister restaurant bottles & burgers ( minus the burgers ) . the arancini ( $ 9 , risotto fritters with mascarpone , roasted mushroom , white truffle aioli ) is just as good as the ones at bottles & burgers . it 's also one of the best items to get at double helix . the olive poppers ( $ 6 , crispy olives stuffed with chorizo and honey goat cheese ) are good and not too salty . you get seven per order . the bbq pork sliders ( $ 9 ) have a slight amount of heat and are topped with a sweet apricot sauce and slaw with a marginal amount of mayo . the churrasco argentino ( $ 15 , angus american skirt steak , chimichurri sauce ) was tough and chewy . their `` perfect salad '' ( $ 9 , grilled asian pears , bufala mozzarella , candied walnuts , rocket arugula , champagne vanilla vinaigrette ) was anything but perfect . the best thing about it was the candied pecans . the fries ( $ 6 ) were n't as good as the ones at bottles & burgers . the atmosphere is relaxed and loungey , which is a nice change of pace from other spots at town square . there is a kid 's menu . our kid was with us and he got the chicken tenders ( $ 5 ) ... actually , that should be singular because it was only one chicken tender with a bunch of fries .
1	tired of the same ol ' vegas breakfast buffet ? then head right down to the maple tree . this mom & pop place is no frills , but definitely has a friendly , homely feel . the staff is also very helpful and attentive . i had the peanut butter & banana french toast which was superb , one of the best breakfast dishes i have had in a while . tip : the cab fare to get there can be rather high ( $ 15-25 , depending where you are on the strip ) . so it only makes sense if you have your own ride or have 3+ people .
0	food - excellent . we had the prawns with couscous and the salmon . both delicious , fresh and aesthetically pleasing drinks - the ginger bourbon lemonade was amazing atmosphere - so-so . you 'll get a lot of passerby 's looking in at you . d\u00e9cor is alright , nothing special . it was also a little dead inside for a wednesday at 8 pm . service - so-so . when my husband and i made the reservation , we specifically indicated that we will have just gotten married and this would be our first dinner as husband and wife . unfortunately , no one said anything to us , not even a `` congratulations . '' in the spirit of being totally candid , we were hoping for a little special treatment , perhaps some cocktails or dessert on the house . not a single thing . that was a little disappointing . bottomline - there are a million good restaurants in vegas to try , i see no reason to go back to aquaknox
0	woke up on a friday morning and urgently needed a pho fix . the special combo beef pho was a no-go . the soup was really oily along with a herbal taste . however , they have fresh coconut juice and perfect vietnamese coffee ! ! um , wo n't be back .
1	awesome place . just about the best bar on the strip in my book . it feels authentic enough ( obviously it is n't , but it tries very , very hard ) . if you like irish pubs , you 'll like nine fine irishmen . first , they have good guinness . on a saturday night , they will pour it quickly and in plastic cups . on a regular day , it 's poured correctly and in the normal glass pint . obviously , the latter is better . however , those weekend nights are fun too . there is a cover of $ 5 for live music is great for vegas . the band is fun - a mix of irish and other musics , and they really get the bar going . the food looked tasty , but i did n't have any . service , even when it was n't busy , was fine but not great .
0	the servings are just way too big , and i feel like the burgers are mostly bun for how much they cost . the food is n't really substantial enough to enjoy next-day either , which is a bummer because i love leftovers . the beer selection is good but pretty expensive , depending on what you get ( some drinks are on-par with competing venders , but others are inexplicably $ 1 or $ 2 more , which adds up pretty quickly ) . the veggie burger is pretty decent , especially the one with all the fixins , but there is n't all that much to offer vegetarians or vegans . typically , after i eat here i feel like garbage and all my money is gone . it 's a good place to go once a year for a change of pace to remember why i always end up back at pipers across the street .
1	great atmosphere in this place . had a huge booth overlooking the bar . had the prime rib , and was happy with it . good place , a little pricey , but you already knew that .
1	the bamboo club was a great evening out with wonderful food , great seating and crappy service . seriously our waiter was a total douche bag . but looking back now , he could n't have ruined the evening even though he tried . we got there late ( about 9:00 p.m. ) and sat outside . love the d\u00e9cor , nice overall theme . if i lived in scottsdale , i would definitely be hitting up the bar from time to time- dark wood , good lighting , and a little lively ! the food was good , had the pad thai and some appetizers . good stuff , well , except one ... i do n't know what kind of crack i was smoking that night but i wanted some tuna , since i had n't had sushi in a couple of days . what the hell made me order fish in the desert ? i have no effin ' idea . of course the seared ahi tuna was frozen and it was horrible . not their fault , my bad . well maybe their fault , i hear ( maybe a tall tale ) that you can get some flown in , fresh , not frozen fish in arizona ... so in recap- great place , cool ambiance , good food , awesome orange chicken , stay away from the seafood and that waiter needs a swift kick in the nuts .
1	the food was way better than i expected . i 've eaten here once before a long time ago but did n't remember it being as good as it was . we sat at the bar for a couple of drinks . the micheladas here are delicious ! ! i 'm not sure what they do differently , but they 're so good . and at full price , they 're only $ 5 , but we were here during happy hour so they were $ 2.50 a piece . that 's a win ! we wanted to get a table but the hostess told us there was a 15 min wait , and after 20 minutes we decided to just get food at the bar . it was weird because it was n't even busy . our bartender was awesome though , so it all worked out . he gave us chips and salsa to start , but the chips were a bit stale . i got the `` pick 3 '' combo of a carne asada taco , carnitas taco , and machaca beef enchilada . everything was so delicious . the machaca beef is like barbacoa and it was my favorite . if you want to just hang out at the bar and have a decent meal and great drinks for super cheap , this is a great place .
0	fine for airport food in a pinch in that for $ 11 or so you get a full steaming hot rice bowl with your protein of choose , some veggies , and it 's reasonably healthy and fast . but it 's pricey considering no drink is included ( even a bottle of water which is $ 4 as it 's mainly fiji or smart water ) . my tofu buddha bowl was a little overcooked and bland . it could have used some spice or seasoning . my fiance 's spicy shrimp bowl was slightly better but spicy and not flavorful is how we would both describe it . i 'd try something else the next time i 'm in charlotte .
0	like cassandra h , my husband and i were also on our way to a different restaurant and discovered that this place was open . we checked out the menu in the basket by the entrance and were immediately greeted by the waiter before we even opened the door . we ordered 2 lunch specials of chicken teriayki . i had tempura veggies and my husband had tempura shrimp with his . we both had the miso soup . my husband also ordered a spicy california roll ( he 's not a big sushi eater ) . the california roll was pretty large but it had no flavor at all . our lunch portions were large but the chicken breast was not quality at all . it was spongy and did not taste that great . the soup was ok and the rice that came on the side was kind of mushy . some of their menu prices seemed high . overall the food was ok. i also did not enjoy being sick to my stomach a couple hours after eating here . my husband and i will continue to travel to lake mead and tenaya area to eat at yummy sushi on nights when we feel like eating sushi . this was a huge disappointment as i had high hopes for this place since it is so close to our house .
0	the meal starts with some really good chips served with a selection of 3 different salsas and a bean dip . but , that 's as impressive as it gets . the main plates are more about quantity over quality and i felt like the prices were high compared to similar restaurants . the service was fine , but i just was n't taken with the food and probably wo n't be back .
0	the following is going to be a long extensive review , but if i may just save one person , just one person and their pet the excruciating experience my family has had to go through , this will have been worth it . i would like to start off by saying that dr. jill cordiero is the only saving grace this hospital has . she is a phenomenal vet who truly does exemplify compassion and genuinely cares for animals . unfortunately she was put on my case once it was too late . this week i brought in my egyptian sphynx kitten , denali , into this clinic to undergo a simple declaw procedure due to the fact that i am incredibly allergic to cat scratches . the vet not only used the wrong tap on a such a fragile delicate kitten which resulted in ripping off the skin everywhere it was placed concluding in severe wounds which scabbed all over , but also ( which i cant even comprehend how he did this ) cut a huge gash in one of the pads on her paws , clearly this surgery was rushed and executed with as much carelessness as possible . naturally she had extensive bleeding from such a botched procedure and had to stay an extra night in the hospital . from that point i was told they still needed to bandage one paw due to slight bleeding and that i would just need to bring her in the following day and they would remove it and all would be well . mind you when i saw this poor kitten i cried . she has scratches all over her body , her eye , everywhere , i could n't believe that this procedure turned her body into something looking like it came straight out of a train wreck . this should not have happened . we also paid for a elizabeth collar ( cone collar ) and were not sent home with it or instructed to keep it on her so that she may not antagonize her wounds . the next day after we had the last bandage removed we noticed her paw was turning black . after promising denali she would never have to return to such a place i had to go back on my word because i knew from that point that something was very wrong . we brought her in immediately and were told not to worry that everything would be taken care of . she has now been at the vet for five days ( including having to spend the fourth of july there which broke my heart because i can only imagine the trauma she had to go through with all the dogs freaking out due to the red rock fireworks ) . today she was transferred to a specialty clinic where they told me that they are going to have to amputate the entire foot . i can not tell you how distraught i am over this and how much i hate myself for bringing her to this place because i feel responsible for this . i wish so badly that i brought her to competent vet who uses laser surgery in removing the claws because that is the safest and most painless way to do the procedure . people please learn from denali 's suffering and do not take your cat here to be declawed . spend the extra money and take your family to a vet who is experienced with laser surgery ! ! ! yes they say that this is an extreme case and they 've never seen anything like this , but every single complication that has incurred has been they 're fault ! it turns out that they had an inexperienced , incompetent assistant bandage up denali and they applied the gauze way way too tight thus resulting in the loss of circulation to her foot which is now giving us no other choice but to sign the amputation papers today . my poor kitten does not have a voice but i do and i will use it to bring justice to her suffering . it is a very nice looking building which they claim is state of the art but every time they would bring me denali when i would visit her , her wounds would be covered in other animals fur from the assistant 's unclean uniforms . when they asked me to leave her with them and trust them to take care of her once her paw turned black , i demanded to see the kennel she would be staying in and thy assured me it would be clean , it was covered in fur . i understand there are many nice reviews for this business which is the main reason i trusted them with my cat seeing we just moved here from ca . this hospital has a nice seeming environment with very nice employees and at first i very much liked this place , but unfortunately they lack the most important quality that is imperative in a vet , which is knowledge and skill . the last thing that left a horrible taste in my mouth , dr. sabrillo , the vet who did this , came into my place of work to enjoy happy hour while denali has been in intensive care with two i.v . drips attached to both limbs and i myself have barely been able to pull it together and focus at work , but i 'm glad he 's desensitized enough to come enjoy a couple drinks while my family is in so much anguish due to his carelessness . if you would like to contact me for pictures or more info please email me at evanonel @ yahoo.com . i hope i was able to save at least one person from experiencing the misery my life has been this week and the struggles and hurdles denali will have to endure for the rest of her life .
0	omg . bad experience here ! ! i got food poisoning ... and i actually went to the er later that week . anywho , i like seafood but not the biggest fan of it . the cocktail shrimp were good . selection of worldly cuisines was blah . i enjoyed things that were not worth the hefty price tag- greek cucumber salad and ms. vickie 's bagged salt and vinegar chips . hhahah . i know- sad ! anywho , i probably got sick from the one raw oyster i tried . talk about not fresh ! totally made the end of my vegas weekend sucky as hell . not worth your $ $ ! go to the reg rio buffet or wynn or bellagio . it wo n't get you sick ! !
1	the chicken tacos are great i hate them two days in a row since i am not out here much .
1	we liked this place for the food and that it is convenient to our house . yay ! very small place that looks more like a take out joint than a sit down restaurant although there are seating available . we were expecting a restaurant and when we saw how small the place it was we were afraid the food would not be good as in restaurant quality boy were we wrong ! and glad it is what it is as i look forward to coming back and getting wraps to go if i am in a bind . i had the gyro wrap . my son had the falafel wrap . he also wanted hummus and lucky for him it was part of the falafel wrap . my husband had an entree which included tabbouleh , stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush . everything was delicious and authentic . hey , i am not mediterrean but grew up in ny . i had my share of ethnic cuisine to say that jerusalem cafe is the real deal . we also had pistachio baklava after our meal . excellent as well .
0	we came here for a quick bit . i was not impressed at all . the food was fancy american fare , but was only ok. the drinks were off . the menu was big , maybe there are just too many items for them to be good at something . it was an ok dinner , but i just do n't think why i would come back . it was not cheap also .
0	another average-to-poor experience at regal stonecrest . i went to the theater on a busy sunday afternoon ( this theater is always busy because of its size and location ) . there was one person working at the ticket counter ... for the theater with 20+ screens . seriously ? can they not afford to pay someone minimum wage to work on weekends , the busiest times for movie-going ? it also did n't help that the young girl behind the counter was flirting with the teenage boys at the front of the line for 5 minutes . once i was finally inside , i 'm always disappointed at the grungy appearance of the lobby , hallways , and bathrooms . this place is in need of a serious makeover . i look forward to the lights going down in the theater so i do n't have to look at anything but the movie screen .
1	really good soups . great place to get caught up on work and grab a bit e at the same time
1	pretty solid japanese food , i must say . i 'm originally from california and i go to school in new york so i 've tasted some pretty good japanese food before and i would definitely say that chaya is among the top contenders . is it the best japanese food i 've ever had ? no , i would n't say that at all . but is it japanese food that is enjoyable ? yes , i would definitely vouch for that . i think my slight issue is that i feel like the prices are a bit more on the expensive side . i do n't think some of the items on the menu are reasonable at all , but i mean , i suppose they can charge whatever they want since they 're one of the better places i 've had in pittsburgh . service is very nice and always coming by to ask how the food is and if you want any water refills so at least that is good . if you want traditional japanese cuisine in pittsburgh and you have some money to spare , i would definitely say this is a place to go .
0	i like this place , but the bathrooms are disgusting . there is never toilet paper , they were out of soap last time and they had no paper towels to dry hands . other than that , the little cafe is pretty decent and the drinks are cheap . good times can be had .
0	food was ok , great place for hang out or for watching sports great selection beers
1	this is the first place that i was able to work up the nerve to get a wax of any kind . within minutes of walking in i felt so comfortable that i went all the way with the big b ! ! ! the ladies here are so sweet and friendly that you really feel like part of the club the whole time . they are also very good , this being the only place i have had any waxing done ( and i have been back agian ) i guess i really have no basis for comparison but i ca n't imagine anywhere else being as accomidating . they also do a spray tan that is based with beet juice instead of orange dye and it looks so much more natural . i ca n't wait to get my hair done , there weekly specials are great . i could go on and on , you just need to experience vanity flair for yourself .
0	turns out the bug infested part was bed bugs by the way ! yes that 's right bed bugs !
0	meh ... extremely disappointed with my lunch at heist . the menu sounded great and the choices all sounded so good it was hard to choose . my friend and i both got the bltc and we were both disappointed . the presentation is nice but the taste was not . first , they failed to mention the bread was full of whole peppercorns . it was way too strong eating multiple whole peppercorns in each bite . it completely overpowered the taste . secondly , i love gorgonzola but they put way too much on the sandwich making it way too salty . the tu bock shakur was great . patio setting was awesome . service was not so great . i will be back for the beer and hopefully the next menu item i try wo n't be as extremely disappointing .
0	my first experience to the breakfast club .... eh . there are much better places to eat breakfast for the price . we often drive by and see it crowded so we tried it on a sunday morning . our server was very helpful , but the food was nothing to write home about . much prefer butterfield 's , taylor 's , or cafe zuzu ( favorite ) for breakfast .
1	i like firebirds . it is was it is . nice environment , reasonable food . servers are usually pretty good . bartenders are always dead on . only complaint .... please take your thumb out of my food when delivering it ! ! ! use a tray if you have to . new location is beautiful too .
0	terrible service , the food was okay . restaurant was empty but we had to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to come and give us food . we were literally the only customers .
0	i 'm going to start off by saying i never write reviews unless something is so amazing i could n't believe it , or so terrible i could n't believe it . this review will be the later , and i apologize because it 's going to be lengthy . we rarely , and i mean rarely , go out to eat , but i had heard such great reviews for dc steak house so i figured ... why not ? let me tell you why not . we make our `` necessary reservations '' which takes me three times to get through because i am not comfortable just `` leaving a message '' and assuming it was listened to ( not very professional ) . we get there at our designated time , and the place is practically empty ( ok ... so we needed reservations why ? people were just walking in and sitting down ! ) . the hostess was wearing a see through top that one would wear to a club , shorty shorts , and a boyfriend cartigan and gladiator sandals ( how does this scream `` upscale '' ? ? ? ) our waitress was extremely nice , and one reason i feel bad for writing a negative review because she was pleasant ... however , after we got our appetizers , things just went downhill . after about 50 minutes , we noticed the people that had come in after us were not only getting their food , but had finished their dinner and were paying before our waitress finally came over and apologized for `` putting our order in after her party of 6 '' . fine . we patiently wait for our food , and once it arrives , we both thanked the heavenly god 's because we were starving . my boyfriend despises a lot of red/pink , but he does n't mind a little , so he ordered medium-well . i love red/pink , so i ordered medium-rare . he got what is typically a medium-rare steak ( some cooked , some red/pink , perfection ! ) and mine was so rare i could have rolled it up , smashed it down , and threw it on the grill for a nice steak burger . disgusting . the mushrooms , which i would have typically loved , were so slimy i took one bite and actually started gagging at the table . i had to look for the bathroom in case i were to actually get sick ( this has never happened to me ) . needless to say , i was not even going to attempt to eat anything else the rest of the night . so the waitress comes back , asks how everything is , and we explain the dilemma of the wrongly-cooked steaks . she apologizes and takes mine back to be cooked more and bagged ( since i only took 2 bites of my 9 oz filet mignon ... i was not about to waste my money ) . she brings my box over and my boyfriend asks for the manager . the manager was a joke . i am a young female in business ( management ) , so it pains me to say this , but she was extremely unprofessional , and i am shocked anyone would trust her to take care of `` complaints . '' she kept tilting her head from side to side , blinking constantly , and would stare off into the distance rather than looking at us directly . she would ask questions that made it seem like we were in the wrong ( like : `` what size steak did you get ? oh , yes , that is a thick steak , so medium-well will be less rare .... '' as if we know your cooks do n't know to leave thicker steaks on for longer ... our bad ) . she attempted 3 times to give us a free dessert ( which neither one of us wanted ) , and once my boyfriend said `` we probably will not be back '' she disengages and says `` that 's too bad '' and walks off . color me silly , but would n't a professional manager do something other than shrug and walk off one that is said ? you do n't let money walk out of the door ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! she did comp our appetizer ( again our complaint was against our $ 30 steaks , not our $ 4 appetizer ) which was nice , but seriously ridiculous . i do n't know when these people with great reviews are going , but it is clearly not when this `` d-squad '' staff is there . i would never go back . from the other posts i 've read on here , i 'd say it 's safe to avoid if possible . i 've also noticed the manager or gm does not respond to any posts on here ... they need to get their head out of the sand and read these reviews and fix their problems .
1	so before going here all i heard about was how trashy this was and how everyone was bitchy . in short , i did not see this on the saturday night that i went . it was like any other country bar - mostly country plays and then they mix in some hip-hop/top40 for us that do n't know how to country dance . psht - i really need to learn how to country dance ! cheap beers . until 11pm it was 0.50/drink . yikes , that is cheap !
0	i shopped at dillard 's 3 times recently over the holidays . i enjoyed the selection in the juniors department but the staff .... ugg . there were about 5 or 6 girls on at a time and there were all standing clumped together . all snobbing it up . i mean if i asked for help they would help but they were very dismissive , a big group of silly acting sales girls all clumped together gossiping .. makes me feel like i 'm either not cool enough to shop there or they need a mommy to come tell them to break it up . on one of my visits one of the girls actually gave a high five to the girl that was checking me out because i was making two transactions in one checkout saying `` oh that ; s number 7 for you way to go ! '' maybe for the commission ? ? i do n't know but just uggg ! the lady in the women 's section was great ! and so was the women that helped me in the lingerie section . overall i enjoy shopping at dillard 's but you do n't need that many girls standing around gossiping and acting bored do you ? 2 or 3 girls who actually take their job seriously would be great !
1	great place ! had a party of 9 a very good place , enthusiastic waiter , food was great . the way the dessert menu is brought out so you see exactly what it 's gon na look like before you get it .
0	a 7-eleven downtown always make me feel dirty . does n't matter what corner or what part of downtown they are located . they are all almost always cramped , jammed into a very awkward space and made to contain everything a normal store would carry . the clientele inside , let 's describe a majority of them as shady . how many times in such a small space can i be asked if i have $ .53 cents to get on a bus . get out of 7/11 , then you wo n't be spending that $ .53 and be able to use it on the bus . this one is quite close to the center of the downtown region , but if memory serves me correctly , right now , there 's not much else around it . i think i could have been near having a panic attack before leaving here . in a pinch , it 's a quite stop and possibly cheaper than a drug store in the downtown region .
0	not impressed . tried them for the first time ordering takeout . quick delivery , but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely . raw dough was not very appetizing . i called the manager to let them know , he offered to give me credit , but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again . not sure if we 'll order from them again .
1	service and food is as good as it gets in a steakhouse . pricing for wagyu steak is fair , $ 90 for a 32 oz piece that two could share . crabcake with cajun sauce was delicious , but only one crabcake in the appetizer portion . the bread was nothing to write home about . the steak was the star of the evening , perfectly seasoned and prepared . we were licking the bone ! they had prisoner by the glass , one of our favorite wines . perhaps next time i would order the rib eye bone-in steak because the wagyu , though melt-in-the-mouth tender , had too much fat for my liking .
0	never again . we had two free vouchers so we went for lunch and i 'm so glad that i did n't have to pay for this meal . they had seafood , asian , indian , mediterranean , and different meats as well as a variety of desserts . we tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best . i would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again .
1	this is my favorite breakfast spot in arizona hands down ! every time i have visitors from out of town i suggest this for breakfast . even when they were at the smaller location i would bring my friends from ca there when i used to live in downtown . i come here a lot with my man and the family and it is never disappointing . the prices are unbeatable for the quality of the food . my favorite item that they serve is their hash browns . i ca n't put my finger on what make them so delicious , they just are . my last visit they served us burned hash browns but they fixed it right away with the delicious hash browns that i love so much . i usually get some coffee and share a five spot with eric . the five spot is an amazing breakfast sandwich that has thick bacon , egg , cheese and grilled onions all on delicious bread . when we have a crazier appetite we go for the five spot with an order of waffles . wow . unbelievably yummy . there 's usually a wait but it 's well worth it .
0	not that i know what good or real korean is ... but i am a fan of any good asian-type cuisine . simple decor and we were attended to quickly ( i think we were the second table ) . the table ordered the korean bbq ribs and i got the dolsot ( i think ) . the meat was greasy , fatty with very light sweet sauce - just the way it 's supposed to be . the dolsot came served in a huge stone smoking hot bowl . you have to stir it with your spoon to get all the rice , veggies and meat mixed up and a little crispy hot . not a lot of flavor but an interesting option for something new . the sides were good though maybe uninspired . who knew that koreans ate appleas and mayonnaise just like i did in the midwest ! it was a good sweetness to counter the spicy kim-chee ! a good option in downtown chandler when you want to eat outside the box .
1	best of the best . this is the sushi place in all of scottsdale and the surrounding cities in the phoenix area . having lived in japan , i have tasted the real good sushi and other traditional japanese dishes like udon , tonkatsu . the fish is always fresh , some flown in from japan . on a regular night , hiro and his sons are behind the counter , making sushi for the customers . during the cooler months , i like to order the nabeyaki udon and some rolls like toro , caterpillar , rainbow , spicy tuna etc . the nigiri and sashimi are amazing . sometimes , i like to order the bento selection with tempura and tonkatsu as my favorite choices . the tempura here is just the way it should be , light and crunchy . seriously , hiro sushi is an oasis in the desert state of arizona , ca n't get any better ... totemo oichi desu ... ( very delicious )
1	i have nothing but positive things to say about henry 's place . my whole family and i have been taking our cars to him for years and we have never been let down . i recommend him to everyone . best mechanic in town ! !
0	we have gone to the buffer for years back when they had crab nightly and for us it was the best buffet ever . we always ate here one while visiting from socal the crab buffet ended a few years ago but we happened to be in town and noticed the buffet had crab on friday night so we went we waited for 1.5 hours in line started shortly after 7 pm . they had several vip lines and sat everyone in those lines before general public - very unfair . the crab legs were tiny baby crab no meat like before and poor tasting this buffet went from the top of our choice to where we will never go back they are out of town in henderson and used to worth the drive but not anymore most other casinos have a better buffet and better service
1	the cookies at cookiez are so thin and yummy .. i do n't think you can go wrong with any flavor of ice cream or type of cookie . .. but i have n't tried anything too crazy .. the workers here are also very friendly and give great customer service .
0	it hurts me to have to give any chipolte a single star but i am afraid that i have to . yesterday while enjoying a salad at this location i noticed a little black bug laying on its back in the bottom of my bowl with its feet kicking up in the air . gross , yuck , and seriously were my initial thoughts as i held down my stomach flipping . when i brought this bug to a workers attention i was told that they `` try '' to wash the lettuce but sometimes this happens . sorry to say that this does not help me forgive the experience because i can not help but think of all the bugs i may have eaten and not have known it .
0	no i will not be giving you more money . i plan events for a living and when i go to a website , i expect for the website to be completely up-to-date with accurate information . it is very important , especially for those who are looking for venues to hold private parties to give every last detail online . so naturally , when a website says `` now there is no room fees to book one of our private barns or vip rooms '' - i do not expect someone on the other line to tell me they are $ 75/hour or $ 200 an hour depending on which room we reserve . not only did i waste 20 minutes of my time today , but i will not be planning an event at toby keith 's ... ever .
0	this review pertains only to the food and service as we did n't drink . as stated on other reviews the setup is poor and seems to neither serve the dining nor bar crowd well . my wife ordered the bratwurst , only to find out about 15 minutes after ordering it they were out . she settled on the mac n cheese which after an exceeding long wait could only be described as mac n milk . a hostess asked us about our experience and the manager did comp her meal . i had the east vally burger which was fine but nothing special . it sounded better on paper than in reality . the servers while nice did n't seem to be very good , though i will complement the hostesses for being outstanding . as a dining experience i would not recommend the sleepy dog though we may not be the clientele they 're looking for .
1	great place and atmosphere , great ice cream and malts .
0	i 've went here for years for cheap eyebrow waxes but i reached the breaking point . the old location had a small room in the back for waxing and the service was fine , nothing special , but ever since they moved to the new location , each experience has been increasingly terrible . there 's no more private room for brow waxes , they just send you to the back to sit in the normal pedi chairs out in the open . i felt like i was on display while other customers sipped their wine and watched from the front . each time i was forgotten for a good 10 minutes or so before anyone actually came over to do the waxing . meanwhile , since i was so far off in the back , i was among the staff while they chit-chatted with each other or played on their phones and completely ignored me . it 's annoying because there actually is a private room upstairs but they do n't deem eyebrows worthy of it . the last time i went , a girl i had n't met before was sent to do my eyebrows . she did the polite small-talk and told me to close my eyes . at one point i noticed that there was too long of a pause before she pulled the strip off and when i opened my other eye she was on her phone texting ! ! ! she snapped at me that i needed to keep my eyes closed but then went on to say her boyfriend insists on her answering her texts asap . really ? ? are you kidding me ! ? ? ? i was livid . my eyebrows ended up two different shapes and i 'm lucky one of them ever grew back ( thank god i have bangs right now ! ) . i was so mad i knew i would n't have been able to keep my composure so i paid and left without a word . never stepping back in there again .
1	will definitely be coming back . loved the service and marianne was awesome ! she made me feel comfortable and at ease considering it was my first time ever getting something like that done . she was quick and talked to me so i would n't distract myself with the short spurts of pain , ( not as bad as i thought ! ) will definitely recommend , especially if it 's your first time ! ( : stef
1	i am a self proclaimed `` trader joe hoe '' lol . i do n't care what anyone says , trader joes is the best grocery store ever . the arrowhead location is one of the best , i do n't see why people are bitching about it . i shop at this location on a weekly basis and sure , sometimes it 's a bit crowded but it 's nothing unusual from walmart , fry 's ect . i 've been a trader joeaholic since my days in los angeles . the store locations are very limited in phoenix , but i 'm just so grateful they even have stores out here ! trader joes carries so many foodie friendly products , no other grocery store can compare . a few of my top tj products are .. trader joes meditteranian hummus trader joes dolmas ( they even beat restaurant dolmas ! ! ) trader joes guacamole trader joes dark chocolate covered cranberries and the list can go on and on . trader joes carries a lot of vegetarian products as well which is pretty nice . and for everyone taking stars away from this remarkable place due to the fact that it 's not near or in your darn backyard , go take a hike to the nearest preservative packed walmart and load up on pork grinds or something sheesh .. trader joes also has a raffle if you bring a reuseable bag when you shop . they always have had many lanes open when i go and the wait is never long enough for me to remember it being long . the cashiers are always really friendly . i love trader joes ! ! always and forever ! ! 5 stars baby ! ! : )
0	what happened ? they have to have a new owner ) because the prices are still high , and the food was awful . first of all : i waited 3 hours for my meal . it came cold , there was no spice ) i ordered a 7 ) and the delivery guy forgot my soda i paid for , and acted like it was n't a problem and told me `` maybe next time '' i tried to call , i guess they closed for the night because noone picked up or they are busy . i 'm kind of offended .... wow . okay , that 's it for me , and the worst review i 've ever written .
0	this place is just alright . i mean for the 39.99 holiday meal it should have been better . its was like you went in there and your like `` that 's it '' . yeah some of the food i ate was great and i got seconds , but worth the 39.99 i do n't think so . at the time though i had to tell myself it was worth it cos i was in denial . they do have some nice gimmicks though . like the crepe station and the ice cream thing . aladdin pre-planet hollywood had a better buffet than wynn , no offense . when i got to the dessert area i was like wtf this is it . i do n't even remeber if they had carrot cake which is one of my requirements for a good buffet . i think i ate it but i do n't remeber cos i guess i could n't get over the fact of the $ 39.99 . only place i can really compare it too is bellagio which i think is much better on many different levels . ok if they charge like $ 29.99 i would have given it an extra star . haha and i thought the holiday $ 26.99 meal at the mandalay was pricey . that does n't even compare . oh and you ca n't really compare the whole king crab leg thing anymore . most hotels have the king crab legs . i wonder if going to vegas on some presidents day is a holiday .
1	best cheeseburgers in the east valley ! service by there employees is always above and beyond !
1	as my boyfriend and i was walking around the food court in the metro center mall , one of the employees in front of charley 's grilled subs handed us a sample of their special limited time offer chicken sub ( i do n't see the exact name on their online menu ) . after we tried a bite , we knew we were getting one . : d i guess the employee noticed our smile of approval so she handed us each a coupon to save $ 0.50 a sub . woot ! : ) the service was fast and subs were prepared as they were being ordered . the regular french fries were really tasty . humorously packed in a cup , too ! : d
1	where to begin ? as we planned our vegas trip for about two weeks , we were excited about our room at the mgm signature . i mean the pictures looks amazing from the bed to the bathroom . needless to say that , my comment is n't negative on mgm 's part or the room but with luxury suites themselves . our booking was wrong , two rooms with one at 24 floor and the other at 10th floor ? how was that next to each other ? so moving on we just decided to take the different floors and get over it . the main reason we wanted to book a room is 1 ) nice pictures and spacious 2 ) enjoy a good view with a smoke in hand . since the site offered smoking we booked it . when we got there they told us that it was fine for us to smoke as long as we did n't dirty or burn anything because the luxury suite is a 3rd party and they have their own cleaning services . then we get a call saying we are getting charged $ 150 for a cleaning fee because there was smoke in the room . so my comment is watch our for 3rd party bookings and try to book with the actual hotel or casino themselves . we were n't aware of the 3rd party bull * * * * until we got there . i 'm just hoping i can at least help someone from getting rip off like us . $ 89 a night for two nights + resort fee and etc for two rooms = $ 468 which is n't bad until we were charged $ 150 more pros : the room was lovely , friendly service , close to monorail and attractions cons : the walk from mgm signature to the strip was horrible , ike about 15 mins walk to strip , luxurysuiteintl.com
1	lovelovelove . i 'm not too adventurous when it comes to food but i really like their menu . lots of chicken dishes and all sound great . i 've tried a few things but none of which i can remember but i know i liked them all . good mojitos and dancing later in the evening too . definately an enjoyable place .
0	c'est quoi un basha ? c'est un amir mais en mieux organis\u00e9 . le traditionnel pita shish taouk ( au poulet ) shawarma ( au boeuf ) et falafel ( pois chiche fris ) avec sauce \u00e0 l'ail , hummus , sauce tahini ( s\u00e9same ) . navet marin\u00e9 , piment , oignon marin\u00e9 , tomate , laitue iceberg . les vignes farcies , les salades de persils . bon vous voyez les genre . c'est moins cher que amir , entre 5 et 15 $ le repas . \u00c0 mon avis , super pre-drunk food . ( bouffe pour pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une solide cuite ) .
0	it 's been a while since i 've been to this taco bell . i dropped in for lunch yesterday and had great service from the cashier juan . he was friendly , patient , and made sure the order was correct . he also made recommendations to customers on the combo menu if it saved them money or if there was a similar items that they might be interested in . he should be recognized for his effort as most fast food employees do n't give a * * * * about their job or customers . my food came out fast and accurate . i ordered a 7 layer burrito and 2 bean burritos . the only knock on it was that the bean burritos were messy . when they wrapped them , they got red sauce all over the outside of it ... so the sauce got on my hands . oh well , that happens sometimes during the busy lunch rush . return factor - 60 %
0	i wish i could give negative stars . ordered to go and when i picked it up i asked for a couple extra soy sauce and a couple of empty containers since the kids like to have their own container . the girl behind the counter was so rude she said the extra soy sauce and containers were fifty cents each . i told her to keep them . the place also smelled bad . when i got home , the food tasted like it was prepared way before i ordered it . i wonder when the health district was there last .
1	i 'm surprised that no one has added this on yelp , yet ... went to check out the new cosmopolitan hotel and the first thing i saw walking in from the 2nd floor was kidrobot ! very , very tiny store compared to sf and la , but nonetheless , toys ! ! they did n't have any exclusive items other than `` i kidrobot lv '' tshirts . i love kidrobot , but my wallet does n't ... i 'm still glad they made it to lv . : )
1	un de mes endroits pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 montr\u00e9al pour relaxer avec une bi\u00e8re et un plat de tapas . tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able .
1	best chinese i have had in a long time . i tried their orange chicken it was incredible ! ! ! ! big pieces of white meat chicken the sauce was amazing and they had plenty of my side dish as well as the main dish . my honey got their sweet and sour pork and it was excellent as well : ) they did not skim on the sauce at all like quite a bit of take out places do . we ordered for it to be delivered and it came before the time they said it would be . i am glad i have found a new place to go !
0	do n't go here expecting much . it 's really just not very good . my mom said her yellow curry lacked flavor , too many onions and was very runny . i got the kung pao chicken lunch special , barely any chicken , just mostly the other stuff they make it with , and a couple scraps of chicken mixed in . tasted okay , but just disappointing all around . i did like the thai tea though .
0	a sunday brunch connoisseur can not ever get blown away by this place . i will not complain about the ambience , it is indeed pretty . but i 'm definitely not going to vouch for the food here . i do n't know if this has something to do with the chandler location but nothing on the menu is upto the mark . when you look at the menu it sounds grander than it actually is . believe me when i say that the pancake or french toast looks far more appetizing at ihop . i 'd suggest that you spend 10 mins preparing the potato and leek packet soup ( by knorr ) at home rather than taste any of their creamy soups . during the shopping season they put novices behind the cash counters and take inordinately long to serve a plate that totally falls short of your expectations . a strategic location or good interiors does not make for a good restaurant !
0	i come regularly with my family . over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and i have never seen that before . i had the chicken flauta combo , the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta did n't have any favor to it . the guacamole would be better if they did n't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only .
1	i really like the feel of this bar . i 'm getting older and do n't want the clubby scene of oldtown anymore . the wine selection was wonderful and i find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends . loved it .
0	no longer has hookah : ( a friend of mine wanted to go to chill at a hookah lounge we tried calling before we went but did n't get an answer . so we said we would just try it since it was in green valley casino which is down the street from me . when we got there the atmosphere was nice live singer but not what we were looking for . i also felt like something was biting me when i was sitting on the couches .
0	we went there for dinner on a sunday mid afternoon . and after we got seated everything went downhill the sodas were nasty , the waitress got my order completely wrong , they shorted the hubby on bacon and sausage i asked for a cake to go and never got that . the only thing the manager would say was i am sorry she did n't put the order in right . although i guess it was nice that he gave us $ 5.00 off . we have had good service there so i suppose it 's who you get as a server .
0	beware- i had dinner there a few nights ago and they increased the amount of the tip on my credit card . i like their food , but i will never go there again if i can not trust that they are an honest business . shame !
0	terrible host for events . charge 10 $ to get into show . standing room only . an had to be the worst sound system ever . used one speaker from a boom box from the 90 's that had to of been blown years ago . an the place did n't turn the a/c on . it 's arizona in the summer time , quit being cheap an turn some a/c on for goodness sakes . place needs to get with it though charging ten dollars for an armature event an not having proper setup for the guest attending . wo n't be back here or recommend this place to anyone .
0	the current rating on this place , as of 5/23/14 , is three and a half stars . this is about right for king 's fish house . we started out with the calamari . the portion seemed about right but the breading was fragile . it came off easily and also tasted a little oily . food network told me that could happen due to the oil not being hot enough . my dining companion ordered the lobster bisque , which was missing a certain je ne sais quoi ... he asked for the bisque to be replaced with a clam chowder and that , too , was n't very good . it tasted under seasoned and floury . i figure if you are going to call yourself a fish house , then you should have a pretty epic clam chowder ... my cioppino was very tasty and well worth the cost . the crab claws were my favorite part but the broth brought it all together . i would order it again . my partner liked his fried shrimp . the service was good . give it a try ; maybe you 'll think it 's better than my three and a half star rating ( but i doubt it ) .
1	their burgers are great but i 've never been one to go out of my way for one . i get the double double with cheese protein and animal style . yum ! now , i normally would n't review a chain like this but i was so impressed the last time we went i had to share . there was 5 of us , all ordering something just slightly different than anyone else , all different drinks and sizes , some combo meals some just the burger , some protein style others just animal or ( like mine ) both . it was a thursday and the line was long . long . i mean like really lllllllllllooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg . it was almost as long as when the chain first came to az . but they kept it moving quickly and got our order perfect . i just wish they 'd do something about their fries already !
0	this place has good pizza and wings , but the wait staff ca n't handle a good sized crowd . waited for 10 minutes and asked to have a dirty table cleaned up , waited another 5-10 minutes and nothing . you might get prompt service from the token greaser if you 're a cute girl , otherwise steer clear unless it 's dead . sad , i had such high hopes for this place . more wait staff , signage saying seat yourself or hire a hostess maybe ?
0	laughable that anyone would rate this place 5 stars . in the chicagoland area rosati 's is right up there with pizza hut , but they have the audacity to be twice the price . a pizza from rosati 's is only edible after 12-15 blue moons . i do n't want to know what you people rated papa johns ...
0	this was a stop on a taco trek uye and i was glad because i always see it , but never go because tacos el gordo is next door . this place is pricey ! i was shocked at the prices for being a fast food place with a drive-thru . the tacos are $ 3 each and that is before toppings . if you want cheese , avocado and sour cream it will cost you $ 5 per taco . the tacos tasted somewhat ok but some of my asada meat was cooked crispy and it seemed the tacos were filled with more salsa and junk then meat . it was a hot damn mess to eat . i just do n't like getting ripped off when the taco does n't even taste authentic and the tacos are overpriced . if you see the picture of my 2 tacos you will think it looks good but are you willing to pay $ 10 plus tax for them ? after buying a drink my total was almost $ 14 . like i said it did n't taste bad but it was n't anything close to tacos el gordo which is in the same parking lot and right next door ! just go to el gordo trust me !
0	i was seriously disappointed after i stopped here last night . both flavors of frozen yogurt were filled with ice crystals , and were very bland . the staff was indifferent , almost to the point of surly , even though i was the only customer at the time . i walked in with a smile , expecting something nice , but i can say i wo n't be back .
0	we did the 10 minute flight over the strip , the tour van picked us up in the secret venetian parking lot in the rear where no one can see whats really going on . i had to squeeze in the back of this grimey van next to some odd couple it was the only place i could fit , luckily i am small otherwise who knows how this would have worked ! my partner in crime rode shotgun rather than attempt fitting anywhere else in the dirty sardine packed van . they drive you to their office . the whole way i am texting my b/f my last will and testament , just in case ! you get there and are told you will weigh in yay ! you get some all you can drink cheap champagne in those fancy plastic cups ; ) as you painfully wait to watch a safety video that basically sells their dvd 's . then you wait to get on another van that takes you to the actual airport . they pair you with 4 other people or 2 couples however way you want to look at it but it is done by weight . the pilot had the tour down he was very knowledgeable about the strip etc . i suggest not using your flash if the pilot says `` ahhh go ahead '' i was dissapointed in the $ 35 video they get you waving before flight then again after landing its not even real sound and the dvd itself is just another advertisement i will probably never share with family or friends . you get what you pay for maybe ? ! ? ! next time i will check yelp first i promise !
0	1 star may be too much . i 'm going to keep this short and to the facts ... 9 min til waiter addresses us . 17 min to get lemon for ice water ... had to ask twice . 30 min , 30 to get appetizer of hush puppies . 30 min . really ? ? no plates for app , no silverware . had to get up and ask host for them . ordered fish and shrimp and a crab daddy . crabs were ridiculously hard to crack .. they were so soft you had to peel it . it was not fresh at all . fish was suppose to be crisp and beer battered . it was mush . and the shrimp ... no flavor . i killed the cocktail and tarter sauces and asked for more to choke it down . it was a sun night around 8:45 pm with hardly any tables ... service sucked . food sucked . was looking forward to a great seafood meal even though it 's nevada but ugh this was soooo disappointing .
0	getting shoes from the garage makes me do the `` s '' msn face . you know , the one that makes your mouth squiggle in a disapproving manner ! stilettos , sandals and slip ons are all very cheap in here - but a bit cheaply made . there 's a very tacky sheen that shines through this place - it 's all strip lighting , mirrored walls and an array of shoes that look like they 'll cave in within the first week of wear . they have improved marginally over the past couple of years , hence the three stars . but the garage is still pretty trashy , and shamelessly so . if you have a shred of common sense you 'll be able to see that for yourself !
1	one oft favorite joints in charlotte . between the jazz band , etoufee , and shrimp & grits this place takes the cake .
0	this is 60 minutes of my life that regretfully i will never get back and would like to ! ! if there was the ability to rate this `` no or negative stars '' i would . we went to fry 's electronics based on a friend 's recommendation to purchase a laptop . our friend had the very best intentions in helping us find the best laptop for the very best price possible . he recommended a particular sales person , however they were not there when we arrived . now i know my friend had a a good experience with this particular person so i thought seeking help from someone else would be ok ... so my story begins : we have never been to fry 's so when we pulled up to this huge retailer looking like a mian temple my son got real excited thinking this would be like a `` raiders of the lost ark '' adventure , but we are looking for a laptop and not an ark . as we entered the store we were appalled at the grotesque halloween display they had set up in the entry way . it was this life sized zombie looking thing that was cut in half and crawling around on the floor . it was so not appropriate and scared every little child that walked in . we quickly walked past it to the computer area . we enter the laptop area and walked past five employees . no one said a word to us even though they made eye contact . we stood in front of the laptops waiting for someone to show an interest in us , but no one did . i finally interrupted a conversation three of them were having together to ask for help . they told us they would call someone to help us ? ? ? they were n't helping anyone . as we were looking at the very tacky signs they had posted on all their laptops informing their customers about their 10 % restocking fee , finally one of them came over and asked us if we had any questions . i was looking for a laptop they had in their ad and was wanting to compare it to another laptop they had in their ad a week ago . when i asked about these laptops he actually stated `` the one from last week 's ad is not on display and the other laptop you are asking about is over there and pointed '' then he walked off to help someone else ! so another person finally approached us and asked us the same thing . he was more helpful but in the middle of his sales pitch we were interrupted by one of his colleagues and he left us and said he would be right back but never came back ! i asked a third person if they could help us only to be interrupted again by yet another sales person . he walked off with this person and started helping someone else on his way back to us .... we finally asked to speak to a manager and the person that called told us it would be just a minute . after waiting 10 minutes to speak to someone that wanted to sell us a laptop , the manager never showed up . the person that paged the manager just looked at us and never followed up nor apologized . i was beginning to think we were on some type of reality tv show where they `` pushed your buttons '' just enough until you break and throw a `` smack down '' on someone . so we literally looked around to see if we were being taped . we completely wasted an hour of our time and left . we walked past five more people on the way out and no one acknowledged us ... so we went to best buy , dreading the experience and delightfully surprised ! we were acknowledged throughout the store and the sales person was the best ! they were very helpful and offered to match any price from fry 's . to top it off , best buy does n't charge a restocking fee should we need to do a return . i am just baffled as to why anyone would buy anything from fry 's electronics ... huge waste of time !
0	on our way from phoenix to reno , we decided to stop in vegas and treat ourselves to a nice hotel since we had a extremely long journey ahead of us . i usually prefer staying at the trump , but aria had cheaper rates and i figured we 'd try something new . also , did n't hurt that we were so close to earl of sandwich ! the hotel is beautiful and our room was gorgeous , but the staff appears to have some communication issues and it just got really annoying ! the first 30 minutes we were in our room , we get a knock at the door from a maintenance worker . apparently , someone had called in to fix the bathroom door ? umm ... we did n't call and it was n't broken . the guy checked the door and left . we were traveling with a toddler , so locking the mini fridge was super important because if you pick something up , you automatically get charged a $ 50 restocking fee . after several tries to lock the fridge , we call the front desk and tell them that the lock is not working . the front desk tries to lock it through the computer and it does n't work , so they say they will send someone up to lock it manually . maybe another 30 minutes go by and someone knocks at the door and says they are there to fix our bed ... we tell the guy our bed is n't broken , but we we were told someone was coming up to fix the lock on the fridge . the guy gives us a tube of chocolates and tells us someone should be coming up . we wait in our room for 2 hours and no one shows . we called the front desk and they finally tell us that they wo n't be able to get someone to fix the lock until the next morning . that would have been nice to know 2 hours ago so we did n't have to wait around ! the next morning , no one shows . as we 're leaving we finally get a call informing us that they have no technicians available to fix the lock . ok , does n't matter anymore , but we made sure that we did n't have a bill for the snickers my son tried stealing out of there . if they would have been honest from the beginning and told us no one could fix it , that would have been ok. it was just annoying having to waste our time in our room waiting for someone who was n't going to show up . i do n't appreciate being lied to and given the run around . honesty is the best policy : )
0	food was very spicy ... usually they will identify what is spicy or not . expensive for what you get . $ 14 for fried rice on lunch menu . had ordered a dish and then decided to cancel before dish was served . owner insisted i pay for the dish even thou i had not received it yet . overall nothing special for the price . if you do n't like very spicy thai , make sure you are careful what you order .
0	the service at this place is by far the worst service we 've every received in this service industry town . here 's what we love : the food is great . the portions are very fair for what you pay . and that 's why we 've eaten there 4 times ...... but .... here comes the bad .... here 's what we hate : the location stinks for parking ( remember to bring your walking shoes ! ) . the stupid black/yellow egg thing is a cop-out excuse for lazy servers ( flip it if you need anything - here 's my first 'why are we tipping you ? ' ) . if you like more than one drink , forget about ever getting that refill . it ai n't comin . actually , when you order a diet coke , expect that not to come either ( `` oops , i forgot '' - seriously breakfast ai n't that hard , honey ) . you might as well forget your food too . your dining partner may get theirs , but you 'll have to wait 10 more minutes for yours without any type of acknowledgement ; i suspect its normal because of the lack of reaction . the hostess ' 2 out of our 4 visits acted as server assistants . the other 2 , other servers brought our food . ( why are we tipping you , our server , when everyone else does your work ? ) . the cash register and hostess stand situation can make even the most non-claustrophobic person want to scream out 'stop touching me ! ' crowded is an understatement . the last time we were in the server ignored us the entire meal , never said a word to us ( with the exception of 'what can i get for you ? ' to take our order ) , but as she dropped the check tried to start some half-hearted dialogue about 'our plans for the rest of the day ' ( woman , i do n't know you . and after ignoring us , this is n't going to save your tip ) . we 'd love to talk to a manager ..... but one never seems to hold any presence on the floor . ( is there even one ? )
0	horrible for the overpriced food
0	had to try this place based on all the positive reviews . to be honest i love dive restaurants . guess i my dive attraction in the military when we used to go to mexico border towns on weekends , loved the food carts and little hole in the walls . never need alot of fluff , just good food and prices . we 'll based on everyone 's comments i thought i had a winner . place is a little hard to find but once inside it is clean and very basic with a few tables in the front room plus additional sitting in the attached dining room owner is very friendly and always makes me feel welcome been there twice now and the food is flavorful however the prices are creeping up slowly . at $ 3.50 for a hot dog is a little high . tacos are now $ 1.50 and the sugar cane coke i think was $ 2.00 . since i generally have at least one hot dog and 2-3 tacos ( tongue is my favorite ) i can rapidly spend $ 10 for a mid day snack , i guess i 'm going to have to give up the cane coke to stay within my budget , fountain pop would be a nice addition but i do n't see that happening any time soon . if the prices were a little lower , i would give the place a 5 , but as it is a 3 is all i can give since i can get equally good tacos and hot dogs near cave creek and bell rd .
0	ok i really do n't get the attraction outside of the fact that from pure ambiance the place is really nice . outside of that well overpriced in every way in my opinion . i 'll keep it simple as its be reviewed a bunch so lets deal with the nuts and bolts . wine list so over priced you ca n't even begin to or no where to start . only 1 cabernet on the menu by the glass $ 25.00 and it was ahh nothing to write home about . had a bottle that is about $ 20.00 retail marked up to 92.00 but better than 25 . 00 per glass 3 appetizers . fried shrimp quite good best of the bunc also mushroom tart that was pure garbage - and a ricotta mini ravioli with farva beans and mushrooms . sauce was non descript and absolutely nothing special about it . 3 people with 1 bottle of wine and two drinks 3 appetizers and 3 steaks with tax and tip $ 456.00 waste of $ $ $ $ $ $ steaks 1 bone in filet 1 bone in rib eye 1 ny strip strip was best of the bunch but all mean was certainly not tender and the filet ordered med / well came out bleeding and had to be sent back . 1 order of scallop potoates $ 11.00 bland and added nothing to the mix . bottom line ok but certainly nothing to write home about and at these prices i was very much disappointed as i had heard so much about this place . really disappointing and much better places to choose to eat in vegas than this overpriced production .
0	i will admit that upon entering i expected a cool little montreal diner with character ... i was mistaken . it seemed like a touristy restaurant chain with mediocre food ... wait , you probably knew that . this is a restaurant that you 'd find in any suburban mall in canada ... not overly exciting , and if you are downtown in montreal go someplace else ! on the positive side , lots of pictures of celine dion . on the serious positive side though ... it is a good palce for kids . lots of other kids , big place , and the menu is reasonably priced .
1	we 've been to off the strip twice now in the past month , and both times we have had a wonderful experience . every single item that came out of the kitchen was amazing . we had their calamari and tomato caprese appetizers , and both were gone within minutes . for the main course , my husband ordered their chicken alfredo and i chose the shrimp scampi , both with caesar salads to start . everything was phenomenal . the dishes were both very fresh and seasoned perfectly - no complaints here ! after dinner we ordered their famous cheesecake , and it did not disappoint ! the wait staff has been great both times we 've been in there , very responsive and they always have a positive attitude . the atmosphere is casual , with a few tvs playing behind the bar . honestly , you would n't know it from looking at it from the outside ( or from the inside either ! ) , but the food here is some of the best i 've had in las vegas . and the prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality - added bonus ! i 'd recommend this to anyone , and will likely be back there again soon .
0	i called toward the end of the night so i 'm not really surprised that the lady that picked up seemed a bit passive-aggressive when i told her i was n't ready to order and was just asking how late they were open . i called a few minutes later and they told me that it would take an hour since the driver would be taking the pizza on his way home . the driver was a nice , older gentleman . when he called , for some reason my phone did n't register it , so he texted me , and that was nice . i apologised for that and he said he did n't mind . their pizza smelled fantastic and would probably be great if it were just cheese , but the one we ordered had pineapple only as the topping , and the savoury flavours did n't quite mesh with the sweetness of the pineapple . it was also weird because the pizza smelt heavily of garlic , yet it was nowhere to be tasted . the cheese had a good texture that was chewy in a positive way- not to soft , or too tough- and their crust smelled good but tasted pretty generically bland . we had been really excited to try it because of the smell , so it 's unfortunate that it did n't turn out so well .
1	birthday party for my son and a bunch of his buddies . the boys really enjoyed the arcade games and all of them said that the food was great . our waitress jessie was awesome ! !
1	came during thanksgiving and boy was it slow . i 've come before for champagne brunch with friends and that was a 5 star affair , this time it was a 3 , so i 'll meet in the middle at 4. prime rib is great here and the crab legs are typically pretty good and cut in half already for you . crab legs arent old or anything ( or still frozen ) and they have taste to them unlike bad ones you get that are dry or flavorless . prime rib was served and cut perfectly medium rare . the variety of japanese sushi stuff is pretty weak , and the chinese is just okay . i do enjoy the cheese/meat area though and some of the other seafood and bbq choices are okay as well . i 'll be back on a brunch morning : ) .

0	the ice cream here is definitely tasted , but i think the ice cream is too melted . it has already melt down to my hand even before i went out of the front yard . i prefer something with more solid texture , but if you like soft ice cream , this is definite the place to go .

0	went to bouchon with a group for dinner . i guess i 'm only giving it three stars because at that price point i would go elsewhere and because it did n't quite meet expectations which were admittedly high expectations . we started with some cocktails which were very well made , strong and with great flavor . they also served bread and some excellent spread - i believe it was a salmon spread which was absolutely superb . i would have bought multiple jars of it on the spot if i could . honestly , for me , it was so good it may have just been the highlight of the meal . for an appetizer i got a squash soup which was quite tasty , but i 've had better squash soups at michael mina , circo , mastros , etc . which are roughly the same price range . again , it was good though , the flavor was there and the consistency was very good . my entree was the braised short rib . this was the other highlight of the meal . it was cooked to perfection - soft , tender , melt in your mouth good . and unlike many other nice places , they did n't skimp on the sauce they put around it which i was very pleased about . the rest of the plate left something to be desired though , it came with some greens and as i recall some mashed potatoes both of which were flavorless and seemed like total afterthoughts to the protein . desserts were entirely forgettable . as is the case with so many nice places and group meals they do n't actually ask or provide desserts , but instead leave a sampler tray of their desserts in miniaturized form . this is always so disappointing because if there 's something good , there 's so little of it . but to be honest , there was n't much good , plenty of little treats loaded with heavy creams . for me , bouchon is good , but i 'd rather go to one of the strip 's many other top restaurants .
1	wonderful experience !
0	walked in as a whim . was convinced to pay 4 $ more for polish that would `` last longer - at least a week '' not only did my nails chip that night , she cut me so badly i was bleeding .
0	great happy hour , but very inconsistent kitchen . some days the foods out in 10 minutes , the next it 's 40. we consider ourselves regulars , but unfortunately we wo n't be anymore do to the inconsistency from the kitchen .
0	stopped by for lunch yesterday . it was $ 6.99 and $ 1.59 ? for a drink . started with a bowl of hot & sour soup . next i hit up the hibachi station . the i made a quick round the buffet station and filled up a plate . everything was ok. i wish they had a better sushi selection to choose from .
0	this is a tough one . this restaurant is a lot of fun , has reasonable prices and very good food . unfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week , night or day . even take-out usually takes over an hour ! i suppose that 's evidence of the restaurant 's overall quality , but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that i rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad , because they probably have the best wings i 've ever tasted .
1	was taken here on a date for dinner.and the ambiance is beautiful . since it was a nice night out , we chose to sit out on the patio ( heat lamps are always a plus ) . i really wish they had lights on the course , so you had somewhat of a pretty view when eating dinner , im sure this would be a great place to have dinner during the sunset . i hate the corn chowder as an appetizer , and it was phenomenal . being that my date was a scottsdale resident , thats what he stated was the best on the menu . i also got one of their wraps , it was a crispy chicken wrap with honey mustard , bacon , lettuce and wrapped in a spinach wrap ( if i 'm remembering correctly ) . i wasnt 100 % satisfied with my meal , to be honest with you . the chicken was a little dry , the bacon and cheddar were lacking , but the honey mustard sauce and the spinach wrap were great ! i wish i would of tried the new menu that the server told me about . darn . but if youre a golfer and you come by this course , i would check it out . take the recommendations given by the servers though . they know what they are talking about .
0	the worst tasting filipino food ive ever tasted in my life . food was cold and wasnt fresh . rice smelled funny . best to say filipino food is better cooked at home . the 2 reasons why it didnt get 1 star is 1. its on the strip and 2. only pinoy spot.on the strip .
1	one of my favorite places to eat in vegas . it 's always a great place to take folks who do n't get to vegas very often and do n't know where to venture out to eat outside of their hotel . the burger bar has something for everybody . they have a list of menu items they 've put together as well as a create your own burger side . basically , you pick your bun , burger , cheese , vegetables , other toppings , and fries . they have all kids of cheese , three or four types of bacon , many veggies , several types of onion , and even some uncommon items such as fois gras . they have steak fries , skinny fries , sweet potato fries , seasoned fries , and zucchini fries . you can pile it as high as you want . the burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them . they even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun . originally , they only had one and it was n't anything great to me . since then , they have added a few more options that i have yet to try . their milkshakes are delish as well . i usually make my own burger , but last time i ordered the sliders and they were very good . it was a perfect choice when you 're not hungry enough for a big burger . the sliders are three mini burgers that are each different . i 'll definitely order that again . time and time again , this is a great place and always has something for everyone , carnivores and herbivores alike . i 'm not sure about the vegan folks though ... they do get super busy and i would highly recommend making a reservation . roll up your sleeves , head to the burger bar and see who can build a better burger !
1	convenient location . pork barbecue : tasty . st. louis ribs . sauce : tangy .
1	let 's be real - nail salons are all pretty similar , with pros and cons in each . but , bar none , the best thing about spazzi , is that they do n't take walk-ins . so , what this means is that your appointment is not being rushed because people are waiting , and you are not taken late , because of a walk-in 10 minutes before your appointment . this alone makes this place a little gem . it is quiet , peaceful , clean , and yes , the nail work is great , prices reasonable , and it 's next to a dairy queen . : d
0	if i had n't been born in louisiana and my family was n't cajun , i probably could enjoy it . but when i go to a place that claims to be cajun and i see only pale shadows of the dishes , i come away disappointed . this place seems more about the look of what a non-cajun would expect out of cajuns than what being acadian really is . nowhere to be seen is the wonderful dishes like maquechoux , and boudin , nor were the sides near what i like . at least i still have relatives from lafayette who send me good sausage to cook my own jambalaya and gumbo the right way .
1	never been in this place but the drive-thru is very fast & the service is friendly & helpgul ( english-speaking ) . this is the only place for a good gyro in las vegas . some higher priced places try but nothing comes close to the one 's @ gyrotime . good cheap eats . baklava is delicious too & cheap ! !
1	subway needs to watch its back . comparable prices , better quality , and outstanding selection put which wich ahead of the game . and might i recommend the wicked ?
0	came here for lunch . masaman curry had tomatoes in it , so i ordered it without tomato ( cause who has ever heard of masaman curry with tomato ) . order medium spice . it tasted bland . dish had a lot of chicken , but barely any vegetables . i would have liked a better balance . soup was okay , as was the spring roll that came with the lunch special . peanuts in the masaman were raw . i had ordered extra peanuts , as i have had masaman curry at a lot of places , and i love the cooked peanuts . the raw peanuts were a raw deal . if you have time , head over a few miles to chanpen thai cuisine . much better quality food . if you work nearby and need a quick bite to eat , the prices were reasonable and service was good . but there are better thai places close by .
0	great atmosphere and awesome beer selections . wait staff was friendly . food was mediocre unfortunately . the burgers came out well done . waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked . this makes me believe the burger were previously frozen . the german potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup . yes the german potato salad is made with oil , but this was an excessive amount . would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again .
0	i do not recommend this place for lunch . service - average employees are friendly and competent , doing their jobs in a way that is expected . food - a waste of money . i wish i could get a refund . the bread was hard , chewy , and tasted woody ... like it would have been a tender crusty bread four days ago that was then left uncovered in the sun ... ( they keep their bread loaves uncovered , on a shelf , by giant windows where the sunlight beats down unhindered ... i guess that should have been a warning sign . ) the dill spread could easily have come in a budget tub from a grocer . the red onion slice was okay , though it 's really hard to screw up raw onion . sadly , you do n't gain points for slicing an onion . the paper thin slices of cucumber were pointless , their flavor overwhelmed by the salmon & spread , and cut too thin to be crunchy . the small pieces of salmon were okay , though nothing exceptional . you can get similar fare from your local butcher . the side salad ... ... ... wtf did they put on these greens ? it tasted like bitter vinegary dish water . portion size - small it 's acceptable as a very light lunch . over all , the salad sucked , the bread blew and the rest left me unimpressed . if i 'm paying $ 8.50 for a small open-faced ( and therefore basically only a half ) sandwich , it needs to be organic , local and mind blowing amazing . atmosphere - corporate / faux - indie random second hand tables , though most had their own set of matching chairs . sunlight from the large windows lights the place up , but be aware of where you sit to avoid excessive sun glare . just a side note . their website claims their chef `` draws inspiration from local , sustainable , and seasonal ingredients . '' this is not the same as actually * using * local , sustainable and seasonal ingredients . i dislike it when restaurants use b.s . marketing manipulation . only their bread and beverages include local ingredients , and not even 100 % like they imply .
0	meh . went here for lunch with my colleagues after our annual department planning meeting . our server was far from welcoming , my boss had a long hair floating at the top of her beverage and my salad was mediocre . one of my colleagues asked if she could have the gluten free crust option for a lunch pizza and the server unapologetically told her that it 's only for the larger pizzas . really ? you ca n't accommodate a different crust for a smaller size ? kudos to them for having vegetarian ingredients like tempeh , but i think that there are much better dining establishments on mill .
0	i 've been to panchero 's , and i probably wo n't go back . if i ever find myself in that center again , i will be at either jersey mike 's , starbucks or yogurtland ! the flavor of the food was decent ..... but they were so stingy on everything that it pissed me off before i even got a chance to taste the food ! get this ... they measure out the cheese in this little scoop .... are you kidding me ! ? ! ? ! it was probably an ounce of cheese , which if you are like me , is not nearly enough cheese to go around . also , when i said that i did n't want the rice , just beans , i still got the same amount of beans that a person who ordered rice got .... beans are like the cheapest food on the planet .... do n't be so stingy ! the carnitas was pretty tasty , but i just felt like i was being so jipped as far as the value and the portions went that in order for me to return ... a mass destruction of all the rubio 's , chipotle 's and baja fresh 's would have to occur ... and even then ... i would probably still pick taco bell .... you just ca n't beat 89 cent bean burritos !
1	great big bar ! best burger in scottsdale yet ! 4 $ mini pitchers !
1	so , it 's opening weekend and we have vip passes which really generally means zip at most clubs in vegas . usually , it means you just get to stand in a different line or mob that usually takes about just as long . so we are standing off to the side of the ropes and start talking to a security guy and make nice . we ask if he can help get us in . he says no can do but that we are in luck . really ? why we ask . he says well see that guy right there ? ( he points to the main man picking people out of the crowd to go in ) yes we say . well that guy loves two things in this world - asian women and tits , and combined you two are just that . this is perfect . my friend happens to be a lovely half japanese woman and me ? i 'm strategically showing off my 7k investment/christmas present and hoping to get a return on my investment . would n't you know it - within 3 minutes of him saying this , we are in . score . so a star for getting in ! i know its a completely selfish reason to give a star but it was a fine moment in my vegas memory bank . ( no pun intended .... actually , pun intended ) . one star for kickin decor , two stars for a huge dance floor and with actual room to dance . one more star for fantab music with nothing lame and no repeats . total ? five stars for sure .
1	great place to get that hard to find spice type of stuff .
0	i was a great fan of this location since it 's right next to my place until the unthinkable happened . they delivered bad service . the table was full of crumbs when we were seated . we ordered tea and not only was the spoon still in the tea but it has cheese on it . when we told the manager all we got was , `` i 'm sorry . '' no kind of gasp of omg , how did this happen . not even a real sincere apology . this really sucks for me because i love pie .
0	there was a misleading sale tag stating something with $ 0.00 when i brought it to the attention of duane she was very rude , told me that she have to figure out the pricing and did n't even say thank you for bringing it to her attention even though by law i should be able to pay what on the price tag which meant it was zero aka free . i did n't like the item and had no plan on buying it but so did want to bring it to their attention and do the right thing . instead i was treated without any dignity or respect and like i did something wrong ! talk about getting treated like shit for doing the right thing ! see photo .
1	good cold beer . good chips & salsa . the steak pyramid was excellent ! our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide . definitely recommended !
0	this place is creepy . there was a cop standing around patrolling all the pizza eaters last saturday . what kind of restaurant has police officers parading around to intimidate its patrons ? hire private security like every other establishment . seriously a cop at 2 in the morning at a pizza place on a saturday . no thanks .
0	absolutely the worst choice for our first meal in vegas . this place is completely overpriced and the staff was inattentive . miguel seemed annoyed we did n't want to order right away , but chose to enjoy an appetizer first . the sushi is about the same as the local convenience store . i would rate it zero stars .
1	for a college town-exceptional choices of tequila ! some of the bartenders can get off the high horse and be a lil more friendly . dj keeps crowd jumping !
0	the airport is in need of an update . it is very lack luster , there are very few healthy options for food ( although this is common for airports ) and there are still random oxygen bars ( do people still use these ? ) . the bathrooms are pretty dirty . they have some corporate sponsored `` charging stations '' but they are typically crowded and you can see people up and down the terminals either sitting on the floor or hustling to grab spots when they open . unless you are coming to or leaving lv , there are much better spots to have to lay over .
0	terrible terrible service by the blond waitress . i had been a couple of months ago with some friends and i wanted to bring myhusband to try their pulled pork poutine . i had checked the menu the night before and the poutine was still on it . when we checked the menu in the restaurant we were informed that it changes seasonally but that they had not updated their site . very unprofessional and the waitress was rude about it . we got up and left without ordering anything to eat . we are now seated in grange vin & bouffe with excellent service .
0	ribeye steak was so salty i could not eat it . to make it worse they did not take it off the bill . so i ate $ 100 dollars worth of mac an cheese which was not very good either . my friend had the filet which was ok. i would not suggest this place to anyone . the only thing good was the bread . we did not see our waiter after he served us for 35 minutes when he asked if i wanted a desert since i could not eat the steak .
0	i wish there was a negative rating because if there was this place would get it ! worst experience at a brazilian steakhouse , ever . my husband paid the extra $ $ to get the `` best '' meat , of which he got none . our waiter was amenable until my husband started asking where the chicken hearts and leg of lamb were , then he was conspicuously absent . after asking three different people for these items the manager showed up . things went from bad to worse . he proceeded to make inane excuses and argue with my husband as to why the chicken hearts etc were not being served . about this time the `` leg of lamb '' appeared . leg of lamb it was not . my husband knows leg of lamb . it got so ridiculous we ask for our check , with still no apology , and proceeded to leave . on the way out i stopped to get the name of the owner so i could complain . i noticed the girl was looking over my shoulder i turned in time to see the manager gesturing to her ! he rushed over at this point and told me he was the owner and to take our business elsewhere ! no problem $ 158 down the drain . if this gentleman was the owner i feel sorry for the employees and anyone who dares to venture into this ripoff , sorry excuse for a brazilian steakhouse . would we return ? no !
0	waited an hour for a flu shot ... ridiculous i came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there . this was not true . my time is worth more than a $ 7 discount . also staff was not impressive , massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle . will not return .
1	ronald 's donuts has been on my list of to try for about 3 years , but somehow i have never made it there . the stars were aligned recently , and we were in the neighborhood to drop by . so many to choose from , i was like a kid in a candy store . i managed to put my tongue back in my mouth and picked out a half dozen assortment of donuts . the assortment was delicious . these were not skinny like your krispy kreme variety . these were fluffy pieces of dreaminess . [ see picture ] the bonus is that it 's locally owned , not a major giant , so you get kind , warm and inviting service . goodbye krispy kreme . helloooo ronald 's donuts !
0	2 stars . only cause the drink prices are good .
0	wow , cougar city ! this must be where all divorcees end up going to find their next husbands .
0	few times in my life have i ever been so disappointed with a business ' customer service . went online at 9am for a `` genius '' squad repair appointment ... 1st available was at 615pm . got there 30 min early , and they still were 30 min late for my scheduled apt , and even though i did n't move from my spot for the entire hr that i waited ... ( and the store was not that busy but the technicians were busy goofing off and chatting with each other ) ... the `` genius '' still said , `` are you jen ? i was looking for you . '' strike 1 for being late , strike 2 for acting like i was wandering around and putting the blame on me . after that , they quoted me $ 549 to replace the display on a macbook pro laptop , 15 '' 2009 model . the screen is separating from the metallic shell but the screen itself is not broken . i think that is absurd for a repair , since a brand new computer starts at $ 800 . the manager , ryan was unprofessional and condescending . strike 3. never going back !
1	i 'd go back . enough good unique food to go back . the 5 star item was the dessert donuts .
0	glittering lights . for $ 20 per car ( a donation for speedway children charities ) , you tune to 101.5 fm , turn off the headlights and look at the lights.the lights are pretty , but it 's the same every year . there 's really no theme or rhyme and reason . i really wish they would do something different . there 's tons of advertisements aka sponsors names everywhere . definitely pretty and worth doing if you have little ones . otherwise , it is short drive through pretty light lane .
0	came here in the casino 's ... no room . very old so it does smell like cigarettes like every casino but even worse ... not as bad as flamingo , but still bad . it 's between paris and flamingo . i got a feeling that bally 's caters to older adults - close to the retiring age because i saw lots of them when i came in here .
0	whatza culvers ? i drove by this place as it was being built ; did n't know what it was , but `` butterburger '' and `` frozen yogurt '' caught my eye ..... so i decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 ( dine-in ) . looks like it just opened , and it was busy . turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of wisconsin that i had never heard of before ... kind of like a cross between an in-and-out and a dairy queen . menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich ? what side ? smoothies , or regular drinks ? you walk up to the counter , place your order , take your number to your table , and they deliver your order to your table when it 's ready . the burger patties are different ... they 're about 1/8 '' thick and seem pressed/fried . the buns are nice and soft ... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked . flavors are there ... but it is a different style burger than what we 're used to seeing . i tried the cheese curds ; just wish they had n't breaded/deep-fried them . i like my curds natural . a fountain drink completes the `` value basket '' deal . their frozen yogurt or `` concrete mix '' sealed the deal .... we tried the banana split ( nice ) and their `` brownie cookie dough '' . kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt ! yum ! okay , so i now know what a culvers is . it 's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains . not sure i 'd go out of my way just to come here ( unless i 'm really in the mood for it ) . i 'll have to try other items , but for now , its a 3 star rating .
0	this is probably the worse thai place i 've been to in vegas . the only reason we finished our food was because we were both really hungry and i hate seeing food go to waste . let me start with the service . we were greeted and sat down pretty quickly . our waiter took our food order and that 's pretty much the end of seeing him . someone else brought our food out and not once did he check if everything was ok. the bf needed chili for his food and it took us forever to flag down anyone to bring it to us . every other table around us had the little chili condiment plate except for us , so the bf started to get irritated . the food was equally disappointing as well . mee krob : crunchy noodles covered in oyster sauce with shrimp and chicken . way too sweet for any noodle dish . it only had 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 tiny pieces of chicken . tom yum with shrimp : traditional lemongrass soup served with shrimp , mushrooms and tomatoes . this was the highlight of the meal . spicy , sour goodness . only downside was that it was served as a hot pot and you could smell the gas burning underneath to keep the soup hot . the gas fumes were not very pleasant while eating . brown rice : hard and old tasting . chicken panang : thai curry with coconut milk . let 's just say their version was very bland . i 've had much better panang elsewhere . overall , this was a pretty crappy dinner the bf and i have had in a while . would definitely not recommend this place .
0	definitely not something to go out of your way for . the place was over-run by large camp groups ( we were there on a weekday in the summer ) which made for a less than ideal experience during the two shows . the two shows were interesting and enjoyable enough , but there really is n't anything else in the building to keep you occupied for long . i thought the first show `` continuum '' was a very unique experience . i wish that the aforementioned camp children had n't stampeded in and quickly taken all available bean bags , leaving my hubs and i having to sit on the adirondack chair which were n't nearly as comfy . while the concept was unique and overall enjoyable , the graphics are rather weak and the accompanying music is played at an uncomfortable level for the duration of the show . please do not bring your little ones hear and damage their hearing !
0	peculiar rabbit is quite peculiar . the fare here is quite inventive . especially love the sweet tea brined wings , sweet tea , and truffle fries . not a fan of the deviled eggs . have came a number of different times , although i would say the customer service has not always been the best here .
1	four of us went at 7:00pm on a wednesday night and it was busy with a wait list . we forgot to call ahead and so we went to the bar area to wait ( which was also full ) . there is an outside patio area off of the bar , but we chose to stay inside . we did not have to wait very long ( 20 minutes ) . the staff was friendly and efficient . our appetizers were delicious and i ordered the lemon-grass shrimp as my entree ( one of my favs ) . the manager came back and apologized that they were out of that dish , so i ordered the ginger salmon . he then sent us some complimentary shrimp dishes ! i was so full that i took home the salmon for dinner the next evening ( it was delicious ) ! i really appreciated the extra effort they made .
0	i 'm a thrift store junkie and this particular goodwill location is just junkie . i 've never really been impressed with the finds at this location and it has that stale grandma 's dead cat smell when you walk in . that being said , they seem to have an ok selection of older furniture if you 're looking for something to fix up or paint . you should really go to the one on 20th st. & indian school if you 're in this area . they just built that one about a year and a half ago and it 's clean and has great stuff .
0	beer took 20 minutes to get to our table . fly in my water . half of food came late . service not worth the price but food is good .
0	i have lived near this mcdonald 's for over 8 years , and sadly it has been a horrible experience for most of those 8 years . after not visiting for the last 5 months , due to new eating habits , i stopped in last night to get a happy meal for my son . while i did not know it was possible the service was actually worse then when i visited last , it actually was . spent 6 minutes between the payment window and actually getting my food , and on top of the very poor service and long wait , the mocha i purchased was actually burnt .
1	love this place ! i really hate all of the run of the mill super markets . well now you know that about me . the store is quaint and filled with all of the organic goodies that my heart desires . the staff is friendly and willing to help when you seek them first . the produce is fresh and looks good as well . they also have a pretty decent meat counter without making the store feel like a giant super market . in short i love the store super nice , clean , and organised .
0	even by airport standard this place is a complete joke . i know its a money grab , but even still , i cant believe the great sammy hagar would even put his name on this garbage . the food is gross , the place doesnt feel clean , there are plastic utensils , its way over priced . just grab a sandwich from a kiosk or eat on the plane or better yet , starve . any of these options are better than this complete dump .
1	i am definitely a fan . their tacos are big and very tasty . i really love the steak and the al pastor tacos . their meat tastes so good and this is hard to find at most taco shops here in las vegas . with 2 tacos you are good and the tacos are served with beans , cheese , 2 corn tortillas , and if you want at an extra cost , sour cream and guacamole . it 's my favorite taco shop with tacos el gordo : ) they also have fruit juices that are very good , the mango is delicious .
1	secret gem hidden in a residential neighborhood . interior is clean and inviting . seating is pretty limited so expect to wait if you arrive during peak hours . great steak & eggs or steak sandwhich for $ 5.99 , but it does n't taste like it was $ 5.99 . service is always tops and you know a place is good when servers know customers by name . my parents love this place so much they sometimes go 5 plus times a week . nothing on the menu is breathtaking just your normal family restaurant food . great prices , fantastic specials , and consistently good services . in a town like vegas you ca n't beat that .
0	this is a ciaa weekend review . the big chill is definitely properly named , especially the big part , the place is huge , several rooms including one huge main room . it 's also a laid back place for the most part so it was chill . a little on the fancy side but nobody was wearing tuxedos so it was chill in my eyes . the night started slow and the size of the place kind of made it look too big but as people arrived the extra space was definitely needed and appreciated . the club is big enough that you can dance and have a good time without constantly bumping into everyone around you but also not so huge that you wo n't still be around other people . the bartenders were good and made the drinks strong but at the same time very reasonable priced . i 'm used to dc prices when drinks are going for 10+ dollars , so a 5 or 6 dollar mixed drink was right up my alley . security and the front door were cool , they knew people were there to have a good time and did n't go through all the pretending that their club was extra hot by making people wait outside for no real reason . one odd thing i did notice was that the group i was with all brought tickets in advance and some of the group , their tickets were brought by one guy , well at the big chill , the person who actually bought the tickets must be present for you to gain entry . i could see this being a problem if you get your tickets from a friend in advance but do n't arrive to the party with them , you may have to wait . no huge issue though . there is no real parking lot and if there is , it is either small or hidden , so we valeted the car but even that was affordable and honestly you just feel extra fancy when you pull up to a venue and somebody opens the door for you . the big chill was a cool place to have a night out , definitely more fun if you 're with a bigger crowd because like i said the place is a bit on the massive side but i judge places about how much fun i had and i had a cool time . i recommend the big chill for your partying needs .
0	i love trader joe 's , can i say that ? best prices/best quality for nuts ( almonds , pecans , walnuts , etc . ) and nut products ( almond butter , etc . ) that i have found anywhere . awesome produce , awesome stuff that you ca n't find anywhere else . also , joe joe 's , ftw ! i would give this particular one 5 stars except for 2 things : 1. just try and find a parking spot around noon on any weekday . i dare you . 2. it 's so smaaaaaalllll : ( otherwise , awesome .
1	love kohl 's , have been there twice in the last month , they keep sending me coupons through the mail , $ 10.00 , coupons , i can purchase a blouse that is regular price of $ 38.00 , on sale for $ 14.99 , and only have to pay a little over $ 6.00 , using my coupon , they always have great sales ! and it is right up the street !
0	i had both a red tinga as well as a chili verde gordita . i also enjoyed a large cup of the best horchata in las vegas . fresh and warm , the gorditas were filling and good ..... but not great . good for a quick stop , but there are much better options when looking for a full flavored , spicy , authentic gordita . the service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean , almost antiseptic .
1	i stopped in today for lunch . the staff were nice , service was fast . the food would be what i 'd consider a restaurant style bbq . the ribs tasted like they were smoked and dry rubbed , pretty good even though im more a fan of a more vinegary and fatty rib . the cornbread was ok. the hot sauce was a little over powering , not from heat .. it just did n't leave any room for the flavor of the meat . overall good experience but the place was empty ... so if you want a bbq place in the south side .. you should probably stop in so they keep their lunch hours .
0	read in the paper this location has closed ! it was a decent place to eat at the handful of times i went there . hope something good goes in its place fast .
0	i had a morning appointment for a facial at skin gravy . my drive time to the business was 30-40 minutes . i arrived to their main cross roads and had a difficult time finding their suite . i had pulled over and called the business a few times . no one answered the phone , so i began driving around the complex one more time and by my lucky stars , found the place . however , i was late . i walked inside and no one greeted me . i did n't see or hear anyone . i shouted `` hello '' twice . i was about to walk out the door , since i had been standing at the counter for a couple of minutes when finally an employee stepped out . i was told that i was late and could not keep my appointment , because there was no receptionist to answer my phone calls for help . all in all , i was penalized for them not having a receptionist and for the employees who were there who could not pick up the phone . on top of the lack of common sense to help out the business and answer the phone , the employee argued with me about giving me another appointment . i was told to give them my name and number and they would call me sometime . i asked when they would call me and was informed that they had no idea , but hopefully today . terrible customer service . i give 1/2 star for the employee finally thinking about customer service and the business and taking my number down .
0	over priced food . food was ok. nothing really speical about it . maybe just the decorations .
0	this is a very busy dollar store . no matter what time i go in there is always a line at the cashiers station . this location has a good variety of merchandise , but the shelves ( because they are so busy ) are never fully stocked . the employees definitely make this place 3.5 stars . i think they are always friendly , even with a line wrapped around to the door . they try their best even without a lot of extra help , and that 's pretty much all you can ask for from your cashier .
0	i found this museum difficult to follow . i was also over it halfway into the second floor . it is much bigger than you expect and because there is only a general trajectory holding the whole flow together , it jumps around a lot from place to place with lots and lots of disparate info that i had a really hard time keeping straight . there are lots of video presentations , which i do think helped tremendously , especially as i got through floors one and two and was sick of reading itty , bitty little info cards on the sides of pictures .
0	listen , i 'm not a big chicken wing fan . yes i like chicken wings but my tastes are n't well tuned in enough to discern good wings from bad . that being said , i think d.d . peckers is a-ok ! i still like the home town feel of the place , the non chicken wing food is actually really good to . i tried the shrimp salad ( was a bit sad to see it come out fried ) . it was actually really good though . beer specials could 've been a little bit better and the selection is a little lacking for me but either way this is a solid 'hood bar with great servers . make sure to check out the license frames on the wall for a good laugh .
0	showed up to get oil change . one car in garage and two open bays . informed it will be over 30 minutes before they can even get my car in .
0	i 've lived in california for almost my entire life and have gone to many delicious boba/milk tea places . comparing boba teahouse to places such as the renounced tebo tebo in westminster , socal and tapioca express in san jose , norcal .. i would probably have to say boba tea house sucks but it 's the only decent boba fix you can get in chandler . when i mean `` decent '' there 's only two boba places in chandler ( boba teahouse and lollicup ) so the standards are n't really high . overall milk tea is disgusting .. it 's made from a powdered base . like really ? it 's inexpensive to buy half & half and brew tea to make milk tea rather than buying milk tea powdered bases . anywho , if you 're like desperate for a boba/milktea/asian flared drinks , you can get a fix here .
0	* i am not a vegetarian . my usual thai restaurant was closed so we 've decided to try another place out . ordered chicken pad thai and a pineapple fried rice . noodle for pad thai was undercooked , it was too chewy and some part was hard . they did not ask us for the level of spiciness , just gave us a very sweet pad thai . it was too sweet for me , because i usually have spicy pad thai . other than that it was okay . for the pineapple fried rice , it just tasted like catchup . some might like it , but not for me . i am used to other restaurants ' pineapple fried rice which does not taste like catchup at all . for me it was horrible . the decor of the restaurant is outdated . looks like a local family owned restaurant . nothing below or above that . which i do not mind anyway . overall , i would describe the food as ... food i get to eat when i go over friend 's house . not extremely good and not awfully bad , but just little different taste than what i usually have . different style . definitely a homemade food taste . if you get what i mean .
1	i work right across the street from antonio 's salon & barber shop and have been coming to him for over a year and a half ! he is absolutely fantastic . he knows exactly what i like and the style of haircut i am picturing . he is very professional with his work , reasonable with his prices , and gives a specialized haircut exactly to the t ! i rate him 5 stars .
0	atmosphere , alcohol , and service . if that 's all your looking for , then you 've found a nice spot . however , if you intend on eating i 'd suggest you continue driving down the street to one of the many scottsdale restaurants that will deliver a much better meal . we were part of a large party with a pre-ordered dinner , so perhaps this played into the quality .... really hard to say . our grilled romaine salad tasted very reminiscent of those days when my father would douse the bbq with lighter fluid and then attempt to tell us later the flavor that was strangely burning our tongues was `` outdoor grilling at it 's best '' . sorry , but it did n't work for dad and it did n't work last night either . i thought that perhaps the salad was a fluke , but unfortunately the disappointment continued through the bland spaghetti-o like pasta and the easy bake oven version of dessert . if any of the food had displayed the slightest bit of potential , i would have been happy to give them another shot . but life is short and there 's too many other restaurants putting forth a much better effort .
0	location is excellent . open 24 hours is a great thing for us tempenians who are sick of gus 's pizza and filibertos . food is good too . one thing that turned me off from giving this 4 stars was this a-hole guy working there . has a long white beard thing . anyway i 'll probably go back until a great greek place opens up that is 24 hours
0	ordered two bowls of noodle with the wife . an hour after walking in the door , we still did n't have noodles . the waitress walked by 6 or seven times and was avoiding making eye contact . finally we had to leave to pick up our kids , not having eaten , not having had any sort of good service . the waitress could n't fathom why we would leave after having already been there about an hour . i have eaten here before and it has decent food but i wo n't be wasting anymore of my time here . the complete lack of an attempt at service or even acknowledging the lack of it is inexcusable in a service industry with so many options . hana has better sushi/japanese and is very near by on 7th ave .
0	i went to a late lunch here today . great food and great carhops ! a reasonable value and quick service . unfortunately , it all comes with a large helping of rudeness from the person taking the orders . you never see the person who takes your order which is a major weakness in their system . today that anonymity was taken advantage of by someone who decided to be abrasive and condenscending so if you are really hungry and want a side order of crappy attitude and abuse with your lunch , this is the place for you . personally , i 'm going to give it some time because no business can succeed with an employee acting like this .
1	the d\u00e9cor is simple but upscale , service is very good , and the price is way high for the tiniest plates i 've ever had , but this is some of the best food i 've ever had ! just a beautiful exotic dance of familiar flavors , warm and melting in your mouth . the steak melted on my tongue ! where did it go ? just slid down my throat ! sweet jesus ! went there on a date , spent over a hundred bucks , ordering plate after plate of food that made me cry for what i 've missed all my life . do i still think it 's over priced ? yes , because i have n't been back since this time last year ! just too much to pay and still have no leftovers . fyi , i 'm 5 ' 8 with a 27 in waist , no fatty but i expect to be fed ! perhaps i also fear that our next encounter can not top the first , so i savor this sweet memory ...
0	well , i guess i 'll be the first to give a not-so-great review . i so love hubert keller from all the cooking shows ( and actually , i rode in an elevator at mandalay with him- but could n't get the nerve up to say anything ! doh ! ) . i had high expectations , and felt so let down . we sat at the bar , as the booths and tables were all full . the service was friendly . we ordered the strawberry mojitos to start . they were not good . they tasted like cherry 7-up and the strawberries were so big they clogged the straw- so you could n't get a sip without scooting your straw around and trying to dislodge the strawberry . we ordered the mix of 3 fried things and 5 sauces to share , and i ordered the veggie burger . i found it a bit daunting to choose from all the little extras for the burger . i did try a couple , and , in the end , my veggie burger ended up costing around 15 bucks ( with no fries ... those we had to pay extra for ) . we chose the mozz sticks , sweet potato fries , and regular french fries for our combo . for sauces , we chose the spicy ketchup , the tartar sauce , the cinnamon sauce , the chipotle aioli .... and i ca n't remember the other one . they were n't horrible , but none of them were special . again , it 's hubert keller 's restaurant , so i figured the sauces would be sublime . the fries were also so disappointing ! just basic , frozen fries . the sweet potato fries were great with the cinnamon sauce , and i usually do n't care for sweet anything . they were the highlight . my veggie burger sucked . for one , it was huge . hotel rooms in vegas typically do n't have microwaves , so there is no way to reheat left-overs . i do n't understand why vegas restaurants serve such ridiculous portions when you can not enjoy left-overs ! more than half of my veggie burger was thrown away . the burger was also mushy and tasteless . i ordered some of the cool sounding add-ons , but could n't taste them at all . the beet relish came in a little ramekin and had no flavor whatsoever . my sister and her friend liked their meat burgers , so maybe it 's just the veggie burger . if i ever try the place again , i 'll try the vegan sandwich ( with the roasted veggies ) on ciabatta .
0	we 've been to boneheads several times over the past few years . the food always tastes fresh and is seemingly healthy . the problem we 've run into the last few times has been the service . the last time we went it was slow and unwelcoming and we said we would n't go back . and then we ran across a coupon . so today we went for lunch after probably a 6 month hiatus . the restaurant felt unclean - the tables were sticky , the napkin dispenser was sticky and broken , food was sitting on a lot of tables well after folks had left . we were there at about 1:30 , so it 's safe to say the lunch crowd had come and gone and the staff just was n't picking up leftover food . so , with food sitting around and sticky surfaces we did n't have a great impression when we sat down at our table . also - it 's clear that they 've updated the large menu board , but the menu copy that 's taped to the counter in front of the register is still showing the old prices . details , details , it all matters when you 're trying to convince me that your restaurant is where i should spend my money . as we 're sitting there waiting for our food ( which imo took too long based on the crowd in the restaurant ) , a young man came in wearing all workout gear , sweating and dirty . he walked right behind the counter and into the kitchen where he was joking and chatting with the staff . i never saw him wash his hands and he was touching the registers , counters , and the supposedly clean staff members . he placed his order from behind the counter and with his sweaty clothes on , he waited for his order to appear in the `` order up '' area - right where the cook was preparing my lunch . no , i 'm not okay with some sweaty guy standing next to where my lunch is being prepared . i do n't care if you 're the owner , the owner 's son or a random employee . you are not clean and that is a horrible impression on customers . our lunch was okay , but frankly , i was disgusted with the sticky surfaces and sweaty visitor to really enjoy it . i 'm afraid that what was once a great restaurant when it opened has now become a dirty alternative to what it was in it 's prime . boneheads - if you 're going to have a kitchen open to where all of your customers can see what 's going on , i suggest to treat it as such . and while you 're at it , clean the tables , pick up old food and replace your napkin dispensers . gross .
0	i ca n't stand this place .... or maybe the corporation . the past three visits there , i 've gone in to get the latest disney movie with a coupon . first off , they never have the latest releases in a nice display .... they 're hidden amongst other movies . if you want the blu-ray .... forget it , that 's in another part of the store . `` you have a coupon to buy `` peter pan '' ? ? well ma'am , if you read the fine print , it expired yesterday ... or your coupon is smudged from your printer and we ca n't scan it .... and if you read the super fine print , it says that it 's not valid for disney items ( amongst 300 other brands ) '' `` you have a coupon on your phone ? sorry ma'am , you have to print it up and bring it to us so we can scan the barcode ( which is in perfect resolution on your phone screen ) and just throw it in the garbage . '' `` target and walmart are selling `` little mermaid '' for a lower price ? well ma'am , you have to bring the ad in to us '' `` you have the ad on your phone ? ? that does n't count ma'am .... you need to print it out , bring it in , and then we 'll tell you that toys r us does n't price match '' `` ma'am , we are out of stock on the bluray of planes .... and yes ma'am , we 're aware that the coupon for your movie ends tomorrow ( even though the movie came out yesterday ) , and we 're out of stock and no , we do n't offer rainchecks . we ca n't sell you the movie if we do n't have it '' uggggh ! ! ! ! damn you toys r us ! ! ! damn you ! ! ! ! ! no matter what coupon i have , it is never just a smooth transaction ! ! ! ! !
0	and empty club ( determined by friend that was already there when we showed up ) , and empty line , and i need to buy bottle service to get in ? no thanks . this place is awful .
0	the coffee was very good but the service was n't the best . the gal and only employee was n't very friendly or personable . the tables are a little rickety and close together . they do have free wifi , so that was awesome . it was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open . very cool . i 'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service .
0	okay now this is a large chain and on average it 's okay to good ! and i have been to this place many , many times , but i have to say the last time i went there for the happy hour hot wings ( they were dry , over cooked ) then i had ordered a steak and seafood combo ( cajun ) something but after my second brew i thought it was me , so i had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty ! ! ! ! it tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food , but my waitress assured me that could not have happened `` because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made '' ( gross , that did it for me ) i was outta there with the quickness ...
0	well .... where to start ? ? ? ? i was on fremont street for the year of the snake celebration events and i was hungry .... i took a walk from the stage and found myself lost in a different time zone .... did i fall through a time rift that brought me back to the early 80 's hmmmm ...... i like the music and the tv shows were great but i digress . no time rift no alternate universe on fremont street .... nope i was in the paradise buffet ... a look back into a culinary error ( sorry mean to say era ) that has long past on the vegas strip but is alive and well in on fremont street . atmosphere- interesting if you like that vintage diner feel ... ( yes plastic flowers and all ) service- great ! ! ! our server was right there as soon as i put down my fork or hit the bottom of my glass with the the following line `` go get some more '' and `` let me refill that for you '' the hawaiian shirts and the flowers in the hair i guess you can compare to `` flare '' that you see at other restaurants but it just fit right in with everything else . food- ummm hmmmmm well it was ummm homey and not in a bad way the items on the buffet were all very identifiable from the iceberg lettuce salad ( really ) to the cold cuts ( really really ) to the make your own taco station . you knew what you were getting yourself into from a culinary standpoint and did not have to ask any question about what an item was . more then likely you have had it a few nights ago for dinner . all in all great place to sit relax and enjoy some comfort buffet food that you wont see on the vegas strip ... anywhere and that is not a bad thing .
1	i have been visiting my 80yo friend and neighbor for almost a month now here . compared to tlc in henderson , this place is heaven sent . most of the staff says hello and express interest in my friend 's concerns and needs all the time . i can see that this rehab center helps the resident to progress and they never give up on them . the staff are very patient , kind , and self motivated in doing their job . kudos to mike in p.t. , jackie in nurse aides , and more . thank you for having standards that most rehabs dont .
0	they used to be better here but all the good employees seem to never stay somewhere too long these days ! now days , the staff is ok , not great and they have all kinds of signs in their drive thru that are written by an angry child . `` please keep transactions less than 5 and make sure your transaction is ready ! ! ! '' or something like that ! it 's annoying when you go inside and need a notary or something and they try to sell you an auto loan or ask to refi your house .
1	great pho , the broth is so delicious and a great big portion . try the rolls too , they do it right ! been here on a couple of occassions since it 's a far drive , but a great place to stop by for some great food . tried a few different items when dining with a group recently . enough for everyone to share and even took some leftovers . even though they were close to closing time , they allowed us and some other folks in . great people .
0	yes , only 2 stars ... why ? i was craving firehouse subs . i had been to the rainbow location before - and well , not just for the cool soda machine , but my sandwich was excellent - service was excellent . ok ... so , back to this brand new durango location : sandwich - very good . staff - very good and accommodating with our special request . however , this store is dirty ! maybe it was the end of the night , maybe a little of the dirt and crumbs were because of that , but there was a lot that was old . also , on the table that holds the napkins and silverware - there was a bucket with wet towels , soaking in a cleaning solution - just sitting out in a service area . firehouse subs is also known for their selection of hot sauces . they had a huge selection , including their signature sauce . every bottle i opened to try had a crusty , dried up ring around the pour area . in otherwords , they never wipe down these bottles . discusting . lastly , i had not noticed the mural on the wall until i read the previous review . this is very disturbing ! i wish i had taken a picture of it . it is a yellow clark county fire truck - a fireman holding a hose , and - wait for it ... water coming out at full force at a fox . the poor fox 's body was bent in half from the force of the water ! i am sure it was meant to be fun , however ( and this is coming from someone who does not get easily offended ) , this was straight up cruelty . would i go back to firehouse , sure .... would i go back to this one - no .
0	alto e gets an `` a '' for ambiance and service . alto e is situated in the scottsdale hyatt - beautiful venue . the service was impeccable , the staff were attentive and friendly . where alto e fails short , the food . i was looking forward to a great meal and left disappointed . we had the crab linguine and it was unbelievable salty . we also had the duck confit and while the dish was decent , there was nothing spectacular about it . the highlight of the night was the gondola ride , it came complimentary with our dinner . major brownie points if you 're trying to impress your date .
1	professional and caring . gary was always available to answer our questions and took extra time to explain in detail what was happening to our family . he managed the cleaning and repairs required to complete the transaction in a timely and professional manner . even after the sale he continued to assist us , i highly recommend gary and his company and will be using him again in the future . thanks again gary for a job well done .
0	not at bad overall buffet but have had better . for those that like seafood a good spot to pig out . otherwise may want to go to a typical chinese buffet place due to the price . goods : -sushi was freshly made and pretty good variety . -great seafood variety , crab , snails , fish , oysters , shrimp ...... -nice selections of ice creams : - ) -has mongolian , chinese ( dim sum too ) , japanese , bads : -place is old , needs updating -feels a bit dirty -pricey : basically $ 20 out the door
1	this is one of my favourite indian restaurants in arizona . very good food , very good service . their goat curry is so very yummy and the staff is always so friendly . if you are unfamilar with indian cuisine then would recommend going to the lunch buffet to sample a variety of dishes . the prices are also reasonable .
0	they have both a take out section ( burritos/tacos/chips/simple salads ) and a sit down section , which has a bigger mrenu . i ordered the shrimp salad . crunchy textures and nicely cooked shrimp . generous portion of salad . cilantro lime vinaigrette had good flavor . but unfortunately , the dressing and shrimp were both too salty . please cut down on the salt for your customers . i had to ask for three refills of water !
1	this was my first show i 've ever seen live . i 'm sure i 'm not adding anything new . the co i worked with told us it was sold out . and the good news was they bought a block of 300+ tickets in center upper orchestra . as a reward for the annual meeting . talented acts from water to fire with all the wonderment of being a kid and entertained in both sights and sounds in person . fully worth the hard work and effort . thanks cds & bellagio .
1	i 'd put a 4.5 star rating if it was available . the knocked off half star would be because out of 5 visits or more , one time the pecan crusted trout came out under cooked and bland . i did arrive a bit late and i believe the kitchen was trying to close . i do n't feel like a 945pm arrival time for 1030pm closing is that bad . maybe they were trying to close early due to a slow turn out . every item i 've had here is yummy . yesterday i came here and got the $ 36 alaskan king crab legs . they were very yummy ( not the best i 've had , but a damn steal for that price ! ) the ambiance is great for a date . some wet naps would of been really nice after the crab legs , but oh well , i do n't knock off points there . i love the arnold palmer . i think the lemonade is their restaurant recipe , and it really gives a great after taste with the arnold palmer .
1	i 've been going to this office for about 2 years now and each experience i 've had has been a positive one . the staff is fabulous and i 've never had a problem getting in for an appointment when it 's time for my checkup .
1	went in for food twice over the weekend . first time i 've been in since it had its 50 's diner overhaul . anyway the food is great not a huge selection but well worth the money . they also do the best breakfast i think i 've ever had . superb fry up for only \u00a36.50 nom nom nom . : )
0	well for starters i am not a big fan of the beatles ( yes we do exist ) so i was not really looking forward to this . we had reasonable seats and the venue is quite large and with stage being 360 and they way main stage is set it is possible to miss out somethings . cirque tried to cover it with something going on each side but i found it to be a sensory overload . the soundtrack is good as it is a take on legendary music here . the acrobats are ok but not amazing like other shows . my friend enjoyed it but i was n't impressed so my take is if you are a beatles fan by all means go for it but if you are cirque fan there are much better options .
1	if i really enjoyed this chill spot in the bellagio right beside the large garden . i ate at the bar on a monday morning , had the lobster omlette .... the cheese was just right inside the omlette , the lobster was ok .... i really was just looking for a basic breakfast with hashbrowns and toast .... and thats exactly what i got . hashbrowns were good ... nothing was too greasy , i did n't feel bloated afterwards , it was very peaceful and i like how you get a little container of honey with your tea and different jams . if you just want a basic breakfast that is n't too expensive , defiantly come here . i will go here again if i stay at the bellagio .
1	we called george to help us build two media centers to accommodate our electronics and large televisions . george gave us a fair price and did excellent work . we are very happy with his company and his services . thank you yelp and thank you george .
1	buffet is good . theater has shows all day for $ 6
1	for such a small restaurant , root 174 has a rather large reputation . with enough tables to seat no more than twenty people or so , you walk into pedestrian decor , pizza parlor tables , and a very bland-appearing bar . the bar is stocked with the classic cookbooks , such as modernist cuisine and julia childs . i had a good laugh thinking of the chefs , flipping through the books preparing the dish . it 'd be akin to surgeons flipping through an anatomy book in the or ! the menu is seasonal - so my selections may not be relevant in the future , but the food was excellent . if the crispy brussel sprouts remain on for apps , it 's a must-get . they are crunchy , savory with bacon , and sweet with some honey ( ? ) , the plate was gone in sixty seconds . my counterpart did not want to venture into the land of bone marrow creme brulee , and we got the wedge salad - which was really good . i 'm not a big fan of salads as appetizers , but c'est la vie . entrees were a duck sausage with gnocchi and some ricotta . the duck sausage was flat-out awesome . the gnocchi was easily the best i 've ever had . i 've heard the top chef critics describe perfect gnocchi as `` pillowy '' before , and now i know what they mean . the gnocchi might as well have floated in my mouth . the entire dish was a hit . the pork belly was equally fantastic - although i would recommend that you get it as an appetizer for 4. it 's so flavorful and rich , four pieces may be too much for an entree . some of the sides , like a pickled relish , tend to get lost in the dish as well . but , man , i am craving that pork belly right now . desert was a nutella bread pudding , and a bit of a letdown . the bread pudding was definitely average , and tasted more like stale french toast . the raisins , nuts , and nutella , did bring some joy to the dish , but it paled in comparison with the apps and entrees . root 174 is a very casual environment , and certainly a foodies ' delight . it 's a great find and well worth the trip .
1	cheap and fast service . this is my 3 rd time renting with them and love it !
0	i 'm only giving this location 2 stars for being open 24 hours and having merchandise although i 'd rather go with eh , me thinks not ! i absolutely hate this location . i refuse to even shop here unless i am in dire need , which i make sure does n't happen . this place is so ghetto , it 's dirty and there is no customer service . spare yourself , if you live in this area travel over to the 215 and decatur location which is cleaner , quiet and a lot less hassle .
0	i do not go to fresh and easy very much . the stores just are n't appealing to me except for a couple of items -- generally snacks . they have peanut butter filled salted pretzel nubs , some good salted kettle chips , and very decent trail mix for hiking . that 's about it for me . i was going by here yesterday and thought it would be a quick and easy stop and it was . since i have no preconceived notion where things should be , i just walk around like a zombie with a purpose to find what i want . checkout was quick -- i only had two items , and then i went across the street to albertsons where i did a bit more serious shopping .
1	i had the chance to eat from the hey joe truck today when all the food trucks were up in scottsdale at the whole foods market on raintree . i had the `` valley dish '' which was pancit noodles , 2 lumpia , and some rice . the dish was yummy ... and it was a treat to have fillipino food for lunch up in scottsdale . the dish was $ 8 bucks . i think it was fair for the portion . i look forward to eating from the hey joe truck again when i can make it down to the phoenix market .
0	let me start by saying that this is all based on our waiter , sloan . my friend and i came here for lunch one day , at a time when the restaurant was not in any means full- maybe like four tables were occupied . let 's get the pros out of the way , since there were only a few : pros- we both got the veggie burger , which was fantastic . it is made with real veggies and on a bun that is purple . purple ! and tastes great . for dessert we got the crepes ( nutella and smores ) and they too were very delicious . but , not even this great feast was enough to make up for crappy service and lackluster surroundings . cons- who came up with the idea to cover every inch in tables and chairs , and in such a way that even janga would be shamed ? seriously , not only was there no room ( and i cringe at the idea of how it really would have been with a lot of people in there ) but our table was lopsided , and kept rocking back and forth . the hostess who sat us even knew it- she moved it around a bit and said it would be fine . no . it was not . next up prices ; yeah whatever , it 's expensive . i get that . 100 $ for lunch for two . now for the main one star review : sloan , our waiter . yeah , i remember his name . he was that bad . the first sign was the fact that we waited 20 minutes for our food to come out , and when it did , the person ( who was not our waiter but some random chick ) just dropped them off and ran away . literally ran away . that 's ok. not like i was going to ask for ketchup . oh wait , i was . so i waited for our actual waiter to come over so i could ask for some sauce . ten minutes later out of the hole of hell he came up and i started with `` could i get some ranch .... '' and he turned to walk away . my friend had to yell 'wait ' for him to return since she too wanted sauce . next up , after eating and ordering dessert we waited another 20 minutes , all the while our dinner plates were in front of us and never cleared . not until the crepes came out did our waiter walk over and clear it off . finally , the wait time for the check was ridiculous . not only had we been there for an hour and half already , we had to wait even longer for sloan to notice us . and where was sloan this entire time ? i shit you not , speaking to the bartender . the entire time . seriously ? you only have like three tables to take care of and you stand around and talk with a bartender for the entire day ? my friend had to wave him over to get a check , and even then we were forced to wait until he picked it up from the table- since he was right back with the bartender ! not one person who works here seems to care about anything but standing around and talking to one another- there were plenty of other workers there , but i never saw one , not one doing anything . well , except for the only other waitress there , who was actually doing her job . but she was the only one . i do n't ever expect to come back , at least not at the same time since that seems to be the shift where all the lazies are put on .
0	we 've been coming here for a couple of years now but have n't been in a while . seems like the past couple of visits the quality has gone down . they do n't always have my favorite egg plant dish and coming from buckeye , i am not a happy camper going all that way only for them to tell me that they are out . like a previous poster mentioned , the food is `` ok '' but nothing great . it 's a shame because i used to think they were really good . what happened ? the only thing holding me back not giving them 2 stars is that it has been a few months since we 've been there . it would be unfair to rate them now b ' c i do n't know if they 've improved since then or have changed managers .
0	worst bar i 've ever been to . i was here for a bachelorette party and i think it would have been more pleasant in a sewer . the bartenders are rude , the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude . also , the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there . no one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet . some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage .
0	my wife and i rolled in here late yesterday afternoon to meet some of her friends . i dig joints like this as its relaxed and homey feeling . my eye immediately caught the huge vat barrel of salted peanuts at the front door - score ! nothing like eating peanuts and chucking the shells on the floor or at other people . started off with a nice refreshing pint of guinness which hit the spot and was on special . my wife and i ordered a dozen regular chicken wings to start.and by the way , when did that automatically become the norm to serve ranch with wings . i live for a while near buffalo in rotten-chester ... eerrrr ... rochester new york and wings are definitely supposed to be served with blue cheese as the dipping sauce ... i digress . anywho , after i ordered i said to myself `` dam , i forgot to tell her blue cheese '' and not the nasty ranch everyone seems to serve . when the wings arrived they were attractively plump and not dripping in wing sauce , which i find disconcerting , and low and behold there are 2 large ramekins of sauce - one blue cheese and one ranch . steven tyler pj 's , steven tyler pj 's ... nice call teakwoods . the wings were really good too ... i nearly canceled my dinner order and replaced it with more wings ( and i should have ) . only issue with the wing app there was only 4 measly pieces of celery garnished on the plate . for dinner , i ordered the caesar salad with `` grilled & chilled '' shrimp . sounded good ... tasted awful ... and for $ 13 bucks far from a good value . the salad itself was n't bad but a caesar should be mostly the hearts of romaine and not inundated with the leafy crap . i also overlooked the caesar faux pas of the red onion rings ... but the shrimp was unforgivable . my guess is the 13 dollar price point is based on the fact that it has shrimp in it and apparently the menu description of `` grilled & chilled '' shrimp actually in essence means cook a large batch of shrimp and throw them in the cooler until someone orders that salad we serve them in . that pasty mushy old shrimp taste is still in my mouth today ... zoiks ! fresh grilled skewer of shrimp off the grill in the salad would have made a huge difference and justified me throwin ' down 16 bucks for it , which is how much you figure it costs with the tip . maybe the owner should watch an episode of chef ramsey 's `` kitchen nightmares , '' in fact any episode , and see how he preaches about the evils of the friggin ' lazy cook it all ahead of time method . my wife has been on phase 1 of south beach diet for 2 weeks and was totally cravin ' a nice cheeseburger and fires . she was psyched to see sliders on the menu ; however , they too were a huge disappointment , in fact she did n't even finish them . the bread was not moist and obviously stale , and the meat was dry and tasteless . they screwed up the fries ... how do you screw up fries ? she said they were hot but dry and utterly tasteless ... dude ... some type of seasoning ... any seasoning . teakwoods did get 3 stars from which otherwise would have been 1 or 2 because the servers were cool and efficient , i liked the vibe , and free peanuts always pull me in like an electro-magnet . two parting words of advice for this restaurant `` fresh ingredients . ''
0	if you 're going to four peaks for beer , i 'd say 4-5 stars , but if you 're going for dinner as i was , i ca n't rate it higher than a 3. the beer is quite good . i 've tried most of their beers , and i think raj ipa is my favorite . the seasonal was the pumpkin porter and it fell a bit flat . the flavor was too mellow and overall the beer seemed too light , almost watered down . the real reason for 3 stars was the food . although we had some nice appetizers ( pretzels with spicy cheese sauce were great , as was the thai hummus and pita bread ) , but the pizzas we ordered were terrible . we ordered the margarita and the italian . the margarita had too much garlic powder , and the italian tomato sauce was much too sweet and overpowered the toppings . service can be slow when they are busy , but our waitress was friendly and pretty attentive . the dining area is enormous , and they also have some limited outdoor seating . but this is a college town dinner spot for sure , no pretensions of a high class brew-pub here . i 'll probably be back for the beer , but i hope i can find something on the menu better than those pizzas , which were truly awful !
0	went for lunch here with my boyfriend and the setup/environment was quite nice . it felt like a different homey kind of place . the food tasted pretty healthy , ( mine and my boyfriend 's ) i ordered the couscous salad with strips of beef and dried up cherries while my boyfriend had a delicious turnip soup . the service at first was great : friendly , welcoming . but then towards the end , one of the waiters was quite rude when i asked for the bill . he kept pointing to the bill and saying that was the bill several times . i was confused because there was no price on it , it just told me what i ordered . my boyfriend then told me i could pay at the cash . um , why did n't the waiter just tell me to pay at the cash instead of wasting my time and continuously pointing to my bill and saying `` that 's the bill . '' yes , i know that is the bill ... food was generally good though . very healthy and tasteful . i give it three stars thanks to that weird waiter .
0	well .... all i can say is ..... if i was you ..... i 'd go elsewhere ! ! ! i went to this red lobster on marks st. in henderson about a year ago .... and i got food poisoning .... badly ! so i vowed never to return . then i made a dumb decision to go back again last weekend ! i had the admirals platter .... and let me tell you ..... i got extremely sick again from food poisoning for 3 days .... and my mother did as well ! ! ! i do n't know where they get their seafood from .... but clearly something is not right at this location ! ! ! i 've learned my lesson the hard way .... and will never ever return to this dump again !
1	love . pure deliciousness . what a treat ! we were with a huge group so i think we ordered everything on the menu and everything was incredible . there was nothing i did n't like . what stands out a week later is ... the artichoke on crustini , burrata-tomato-lettuce thing , meatballs , and the steak skewers . but really everything was great . also the sangria is amazing . we were very happy . they also did n't seem to mind that one of our friends was beyond drunk as we all laughed hysterically . very fun night . so sad there 's not one in california . boo .
0	this store is back to being mediocre . i wish they 'd put a little more effort into lighting the parking lot , and offering to help customers out to their car . i wish their tollerance for loitering was lower . and , i wish their security guards would at least look more attentive ... they seem to be spaced out or socializing . i had to call one 's attention to the fact he missed an overhead head page asking him to go out to the gas station area . neighborhood deserves better than this . the people who work the deli counter and the cashiers are nice ...
1	the owner is super nice and the environment is friendly . i got the dylan is what it is called . green chillies chicken bacon chipotle dressing . it came as a wrap . it is extremely delicious . i just feel the serving size was a little small . the potato salad was good . the cost was about 8 bucks for everything . from this one sandwich i would n't label it as the end all sandwich shop .
0	went there for dinner on monday night . not real impressed . the place is not much larger than a golden corral . being sort of cheap i usually stay at excalibur and at least once each stay go to the buffet . last christmas i decided to spend an extra $ 5 and try the buffet at the luxor and was well rewarded . so this year i opted to spend yet another $ 5 ( $ 26.99 +tax ) to see what it got me . last year at the luxor was much better . very small salad bar . limited cooked vegetables . several meat and starch dishes , almost all were cold or lukewarm . several of the seafood items ( hot and cold ) were soggy . i did leave room for dessert and it was very good . this place has all the pieces in place to be good and they just are not pulling it off well . they have several seafood offerings , they use smaller warming trays so they get changed out more often which should keep food warm and not dried out . i ate between the opening rush and the 7pm dinner rush so the place was only about 80 % full and the lines were reasonable . my server kept my plates cleared and my iced tea full . i did notice this trip the entire mgm family seems to be cutting back on quality and value compared to when i was there in july .
1	great , loved it ! has a good selection of korean food . sushi is average though . great service .
1	the tower has had a pretty high flying reputation in edinburgh , as far as restaurants go , for a good few years now . knowledge to have before you book a table here is that it is pricier than most , but i do n't think it 's too extortionate considering it 's clearly aimed at the higher end of the market , plus there are a fair few restaurants in edinburgh that operate on similar price levels , and i do think edinburgh can be a pretty expensive city in general . i had a meal at the tower for my birthday a while back , and was unsure what to expect , aside from brillant views across edinburgh , which the venue certainly delivers . ca n't beat a fantastic view on a good day while you 're eating your food , so that elevates the experience before you 've really started to analyse the meal . i went for the juicy and mostly always satisfying steak option , which was slightly more well done than i would have liked , however i think this was because i asked for it to be cooked medium , when i really should have asked for it to be rare . i think it was more a shift in the way i like to eat a steak , than an inaccurate cooking judgment on the restaurant 's part . i enjoyed the sultry , nicely mood lit atmosphere of the tower , and would recommend it for anyone who likes their dinner date with sweeping views .
1	great service , amazing staff , they know their stuff ..... whatever it is they have everything i need and even stuff i did n't know i needed
1	went because friends that were in town wanted to see him and he was great ! loved the finale . worth the $ $ $ $ . just do n't stay at luxor .
0	i went here during a recent weekend trip to montreal . while the restaurant is billed as `` authentically italian '' , in my opinion , it 's far more italian-american than traditional italian fare ( fine , if that 's your thing ) . reminds me of the `` red sauce '' italian places you find commonly in nyc . first up was a mozzarella di buffala with tomatoes and basil - a simple , classic dish that i love to make at home . the dish was edible but the cheese was too firm , the olive oil was thin and watery and finally the basil was chopped too finely to be tasted . two pizzas were up for dinner , the toscana with prosciutto , arugula and diced tomatoes and the `` chef 's special '' with italian sausage , rapini and parmigiano . the first was fresh and tasty but a little uneventful . the second was loaded with a cheap , salty parmigiano cheese that overwhelmed the flavours of the other ingredients . the bring-your-own-wine , cash-only bit is a bit downscale given the prices . the servers are all in a tremendous rush to keep the food coming which makes it a difficult place to relax . great place to bring the kids since it 's noisy and bustling though . given the chance , i probably would n't go back .
0	they must have mistakenly put the chilled chicken for the grilled chicken salad into my sandwich and the fries were room temperature at best in one of the two meals ! the good is that the service was friendly and i like the new options that stay up with the trend of hipster food offerings such as brioche buns and pretzel buns and also i like that there is an option for supposed `` fresh lemonade '' as well as salad options .
0	i went here for a team lunch and i was very disappointed . dishes are very small , tapas style , and very overpriced . i went for the crispy chicken skins and they were sold out . i got a $ 12 mac and cheese , which was too rich in flavor and so tiny . the dishes were pretty interesting and had unique ingredients in it which i can see why they may be more expensive but it was just not worth it . the restaurant was pretty tiny , the seats were high and had no backing . the atmosphere just seemed really `` cool '' , but the place is all hype . it 's a great place to go if you want to show off a date during dinner time and be really trendy , but otherwise i would n't suggest it . i left hungry and poor .
1	great little independent place . the owner is there most days and makes sure everything is to your liking . when in town i try to eat there a few times a month . i do n't deviate on my choices but everything has been great and made to order quickly . they have beer by can or bottle if you want and a very diverse menu . its hard not to find something you will like .
0	service was terrible . my first time there i ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger and was given a smokehouse bacon burger with bbq sauce and caramelized onions . disgusting flavor ruined my appetite . went in for breakfast and did n't want to sit next to a loud group of drunks and was told there was nowhere else i could sit by the power tripping hostess station . meanwhile , there were literally 100 empty seats . needless to say , i walked away . under staffing is unacceptable in a place where you already know you are paying too much for too little . shame on you bellagio . get back into the game !
0	got a `` suite '' for about $ 40 for a monday night ( after tax , no resort fees ! ) , very roomy . couch and tv in one room and a tv in the bed room . it was a steal on the surface , but no frills . however , only one tv had a remote ( bed room ) , no big deal so i told desk clerk at check out a remote was missing , she said no problem . tv sets were early 90s vintage but got about 30 channels . also , walls were thin and you could hear noises at night from people in other rooms so it was tough to sleep . shower and wash room was basic , not unlike motel 6. ca n't comment on gambling or food , did neither there , just stayed the night . no line at all to check in and clerks both check in and check out were very nice . only about a 2-minute walk to casino , enter rooms from outdoors . not too far from strip or downtown or east side casinos . adequate when you do n't want to pay strip prices ; classic case of you gets what you pays for .
1	i read the bad reviews about the tailor but i have been there about 4 times and everything has looked good every time . i think the last 3 times i have just pinned the stuff myself so not sure about how anything he needs to pin works out . i just go because it 's convenient but i just did pay $ 20 to have a dress hemmed . not sure what they would charge elsewhere but i have n't had any problems so far so i keep going .
0	i usually come here before a movie at sundance , but after my experience on sunday 4/6/14 , this will be my last visit to sushi muramoto . sushi muramoto and king muramoto have different menus , and we came here for the lunch specials . our friends specifically mentioned they wanted their food as soon as possible , while late-comers like my boyfriend and i and two other friends could eat our food at a leisurely pace . it was essential because we had a movie at the wisconsin film fest and wanted to get the best seats possible . the waiter acknowledged the request , yet after 30 minutes of wait time , the entrees have not arrived . apparently , our request was ignored , and all entrees were served together , alongside with those for the latecomers . the only meal that my boyfriend and i had for sunday , and also till 4 days later ( today ) . we shared the black cod miso and the hanger steak . the afternoon following the meal , i experienced severe food poisoning symptoms and so did my boyfriend , the same night . i do not think it was the hanger steak as several of our other friends ordered that dish . however , one of my other friends who had the black cod miso experienced mild food poisoning symptoms like being bloated and loss of appetite . i do not wish to claim that sushi muramoto has a trend of poor food hygiene as i have eaten there previously . however , the poor service and terrible reaction i have had to the food has me resolved never to return to this location again . p.s . as an adventurous eater , i have never had such severe food poisoning symptoms for as long as i can remember . definitely not within the last 15 years , even when i explored countries of much poorer hygiene standards .
0	if you enjoy over paying for mediocre food and horrendous service graze is the place for you .
1	my kids rode on the zip line again and had a great time .
0	i really wanted to like bonterra . i really really wanted to enjoy it ... but it was just disappointing . my husband and i ordered a variety of items off the menu - an array of appetizers , entrees and wine and nothing really `` wowed '' us . the worst part of it all , though , was the service . maybe the server was just having an off night , but he was very short with us , only checked on us twice during the entire time ( once was to greet and the second was to drop off the check with no thank you whatsoever ) . other servers dropped off our food ( which is completely fine ) ... but the whole experience was a let down . when you spend that kind of money on a meal ( $ 200+ ) you really want to be taken care of - and it seemed like no one cared at all .
1	a nice list of loose leaf teas , which are served in a light-bulb looking glass ware . this jiffy lube converted place is an unexpectedly pleasant coffee shop on the s park street . very friendly staff , a fantastic view of copps , and overall a charming neighborhood cafe .
1	salad bar is awesome with everything you could possibly want . the top sirloin was my favorite but everything was wonderful . the chocolate moose cake was to die for ! ! ! good service and atmosphere ... maybe just a tad on the pricy side .
1	i asked my phoenix friend to take me to the best mexican restaurant in town , and this is where he took me on my visit . i am happy that he did . i returned again during my trip . this restaurant had everything i love -- excellent and inventive drinks , delicious fresh chips with homemade salsas ( the verde sauce rules ! ) and among the best guac i 've had , and creative dishes in small portions that pay homage to the traditional mexican menu . my favorites were the elote street corn , which i think i could eat every meal for the rest of my life , the chicken taco , and the salad with grilled chicken , apples , mint and peanut sauce . the sangria was the best white sangria i 've had in any restaurant . one caveat to this rave review : i did not care for the pork torta . i do not like to eat a lot of bread , and the sandwich was ridiculously huge and overwhelming . beneath the cavernous bread was a small portion of pork . perhaps it is my tennessee sensibilities about pork or my californian experience with carnitas , but the pork was lackluster , dry , and tasted like that pork you get in a sandwich in the school cafeteria with the pre-mixed sauce . the restaurant should make torta `` sliders '' and add a generous portion of real carnitas to improve this dish ( see the pastor at taco guild for an example ) . overall , though , it is hard to beat this experience , the friendliness of the staff , the excellent food and all of the options that left me wanting more .
0	well for one , i walked in to use my free trial membership . the dude started trying to tell me i was doing everything wrong . the record stops .... excuse me . you are fat and i used to be but lost all the weight in a very healthy way . i guess i should take advice from someone who is fat . even though i lost all the weight on my own . wtf ? he was trying to push these crappy suplements and protein bars on me . which btw have really bad ingredients . then i tried taking a group class . 2 instructors , both .. you guessed it really fat . they didnt ever get my heart rate up because they were so out of shape they would stop before everyone else . everyone in the class was looking around like , are you feeling this ? i used 2 of my 7 free days because other than the bad form these people were teaching they all went around telling you that you dont know what you are doing . when in fact i trained with 2 personal trainers for over a yr one of them was in the top 20 trainers voted by mens magazine . unbelievable , plus the membership cost the same as 24 hour which they actually have to be certified to be a trainer .
0	love this place , but so sad with their limited and confusing hours of operation ? the website and voice message give conflicting hours/days of operation ? ultimately , the kitchen closes by 6 pm -- super tough to make dinner plans !
1	first time daisho sushi . i love this place good food and good price . i will be buck ! ! !
1	one of my favorite places . i order take out and delivery quite a bit . i also love that the patio is dog friendly . the meat balls are far and away the best thing . the arthur ash pasta and meatballs is even better . i had a peach smoothie that was really good as well . only thing is i wish they had a steak option or something . but overall it 's awesome !
1	went to this place as a last meal before my last visit to montreal , surely was not disappointed ! my best friend , a vegetarian , was in for a pleasant surprise when the waitress told her any of the patties could be subbed with a vegetarian option ! ( aubergine please ! ) the burgers were supreme ! ( although a touch pricey ... ) the brioche they were served on , amazing ! the fries actually tasted like real french fries , not mcdonalds ! ( an achilles heel of many great burger places ) cocktails were nice as well , a good cold sex on the beach in the middle of montreal winter is not too bad ! my favorite part definitely had to be the ambiance ! very tastefully designed from the white walls to the pop art paintings of celebrities and the high-top wooden tables ! we spoke to the owner , a man who is clearly passionate about his burgers ! will definitely be back on my next trip .
0	if you hear `` presentation '' ... run ! it 's a timeshare scam ! they 'll promise you can see a `` top '' las vegas show at a discount and then the story changes and takes all kinds of twists and turns . if you 're on vacation , save yourself the time and hassle . once you call them on it , everybody seems to be the blind leading the blind . getting a quick refund becomes an impossibility . it took a while but we finally got our $ 50 back . two hours of our vacation were wasted dealing with these scam artists .
0	generally speaking , i am a big fan of the burger . i 'm also a big believer in ( and a fan of ) good service . to that end , dotty 's both delivers and disappoints . the burgers are great . a small group of us wandered to dotty 's over the weekend ; i had been there many times before , while the rest of the group had never been to dotty 's before . we were promptly seated in a large booth - dotty has some great booths ... not gon na ' lie . and then we waited . and waited . and waited some more . eventually a server came by and said he 'd be `` right back to take our drink orders . '' we waited some more . it would n't have been so bad if we had n't been visiting at 2:30pm on a saturday , and the place was virtually empty ... but we waited a good 15-20 minutes to place our drink order . then we waited another 10 or so to get our drinks . then we ordered the food , which took a long time to come out as well . after receiving our food , we never saw the server except for when he dropped off the bill . no follow-up , no `` how are things , '' nothing like that ... just crappy service . he never noticed that our drinks were empty ; he did n't offer to bring us another round - we had to find him and ask for another round . and it took a long time to get those drinks ... if the service would 've been even the slightest bit decent , we would 've sat at dotty 's , drinking and eating all afternoon . but thanks to the horrible service , we paid and left far earlier than we would 've liked to have . horrific service aside , the burgers were excellent - we had an ostrich burger ( with muenster , grilled onion , lettuce and tomato ) , a heart throb ( not really `` hot '' but it had a good balance of flavor/heat ) , a melting pot ( if you like cheese , look no further ) , and a honey dijon ( tasty ) . the burgers were perfectly cooked , perfectly sized , and simply delicious . we also ordered a sampler basket , which included onion rings , deep fried mushrooms , fried mac-n-cheese , cheese curds , and fries . all were solid . a tad greasy , but solid . if the service did n't suck so bad , i 'd give this place 4.5 - 5.0 stars . the dude who waited on us should consider a new line of work ... that 's how bad it was .
1	hey come on its a beach taco shop . stick with the chicken , beef or pork tacos . great price decent serving size . you can have it with the cabbage , beans and rice inside the taco or leave it out . its a quick bite to eat . its not a biog date night here . i stop in every now and then mostly at lunch when i do n't have a lot of time or $ $ and i just need a quick bite to hold me over till supper .
0	not great but good .
1	one of my favorite restaurants , chez vous in scottsdale arizona , serves passport coffee . it was so good the other day that i had to know where they got it . i will be ordering my own stash for home use , and will update this review after i git my hands on it !
0	i went to rice paper once . it was different . i liked the smallness of this place , and for that they totally owns their cuisine . with that said , it is a bit different for the neophyte to the characteristics of the vietnamese kitchen . it has different smalls , suttle tastes and sometimes present consistencies that the western eater are n't ready for . but this should n't discourage the adventurer . the food is good , and it is n't that hard to stay on a meat free path . the service have room to improve , but i should n't venture there .. i seem to be a privately owned business , so i should let them run this place as they see fit . but even so , i was n't blown away - however , i will return and give this place a second chance . .. und das ist nach der kritiker
1	added to my list : yelp made me do it ! great atmosphere and excellent food . friendly staff - even offered me a blanket for my lap since we were dining outside near the fireplace . definitely get the grilled corn app . i 've had it at other places and this is one of the best preparations .
0	i 'm not even going to waste anymore time with this place and simply say a few words , you could do a lot better ! rude rude rude roberto on 03/18/12 around 4:00am you need to ease up a bit and take some lessons on hospitality after all you are in the hospitality industry . the bad 1. slow check in and rude front desk clerk 2. black jack dealer ( female ) again rude 3. casino floor lacks cocktail servers . i never seen more then one . 4. if you are lucky and find a cocktail server be prepared to wait 20 or more minuets for your drink . on one accasion the waitress never returned with our drinks . and yes we were tipping well . the good 1. rooms were very clean but i 'm more then sure it had a lot to do with my room attendee laupe . laupe i thank you for making my stay tolerable . 2. pool drinks and bartenders were excellent . 3. valet staff and starters very efficient . would i recommend this place ? no . i wo n't even mention it .
1	honestly , i 'm not sure what to expect when eating at hooters . so far , so good , thus , the 5 stars . but , i do have one minor issue with them , but not enough to downgrade them . eating here is what i imagined the 70 's to be about . wood paneling , that weird color orange , and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure . so far , when eating here , i have had good experiences . the girls are nice , the place is clean , and service seems to be prompt and efficient . i usually can be found here during lunch hour only , and so far , those have been my only experiences . no happy hour , no dinner , no weekend service . my only `` complaint '' is that i have carried out a few times from this location . a handful of times , i felt like i have had terribly slow carry out service . waiting forever for someone to take my order , waiting just as long for food , and feeling `` less important '' then maybe the dine in patrons .
1	i was extremely satisfied with my waxing services from nadjege . she was thorough , practiced clean techniques including no double dipping and she was amazing at removing in-growns . her home is beautiful , clean and very private ; i felt very safe and comfortable there . her prices are ridiculously affordable , especially for the quality of service she provides . also , i was so relaxed i could barely stay awake and nearly fell totally asleep during waxing - that has never happened before ! i have already made my next appointment with her .
1	i can not say enough good things about this bridal store . evana ( sp ? ) and the rest of the associates were incredible . i had a somewhat unique situation based on the fact that i have 2 mothers and i wanted both of them to have the experience of finding `` the wedding dress '' with me . evana and her girls made sure that both of them felt so special and wonderful that it brought tears to my eyes . my dress was perfect and they were so upfront and honest about alterations and what was needed . i changed up the look of my dress by removing the belt and placing a new bedazzled applique on the left hip that made it even more stunning than it already was . they walked me through this entire process and made sure i was 100 % satisfied . they also made time for my many phone calls and search of hair accessories , shoes , etc . i would recommend them to anyone looking for a dress , and i promise you trust what they tell you ! they all totally know what they are doing ! ! ! thank you so much for such an incredible experience with something so important . i love you all ! !
1	i had a chicken & pesto sandwich that was absolutely delicious . it had rosated red peppers and sauteed mushrooms . it was truly satisfying for lunch . it was hard to decide on what to have as the menu has a lot to choose from . it does get very busy at lunch-time during the week , seating can be a challenge . the staff is very friendly and polite . noise level is in the mid to high range but nothiing annoying . i recommend giiving it a try if you are in the mood for a soup or salad offers more than standard ingredients .
1	a church-themed restaurant with benches instead of chairs , lots of dark wood and a dark , rustic feel ? that 's not at all what this restaurant is about , but hey , could be a hot idea . the restaurant 's name , communion , actually refers to the idea of sharing . we were seated in the small side room with grey stone walls , which provided a perfect setting and atmosphere to support the act . oh , and the food is not all you 'll be sharing - the restaurant has a unisex bathroom . i can already imagine awesome `` how we met '' stories coming out of this . communion 's food is broad in range and would best be described as `` contemporary european '' market cuisine . the menu consists of tapas-sized dishes and larger plates to share . my friend and i decided to start with some oysters , the salmon tartare bouch\u00e9e with a basil emulsion and cucumber brunoise , and rollmops ( pickled herring wrapped around slices of onion and pickled gherkin ) with chive pur\u00e9e and sour cream . tartare is an easy miss , but both of these amuse-bouches were completely flavourful and delicious . next , we tried this whole `` sharing thing '' by ordering the `` stuffed savoie cabbage '' - a half cabbage shell filled with layers of olive tapenade , mashed butternut squash , feta cheese , and quinoa salad with pistachios and garlic flowers . sounds weird ? it was ... but in an unexpected `` i-ve'never-tasted-this-before-but-i-really-do-like-it ! '' sort of way . tasty ( and health conscious ! ) comfort-style food . we finished the entire 1/2 cabbage which , unfortunately , deterred us from ordering dessert . apparently it 's made by a parisian chef ... certainly a reason for another visit . communion 's concept is cute , but possibly only if a pairs agrees on a dish . would adding some single dishes dilute the restaurant 's concept ? maybe . in any case , i 'll end with this : communion is perfect for a chill and comfortable dinner with friends or for a romantic date . it 's cozy , and sometimes , party girls need a night that 's good for the soul . food 8.5/10 , atmosphere ( ifyouwantachillsetting ) 9/10 , pretty people 8/10 , music ( whenyoucanhearit ) 8/10 , service 9.5/10 . pictures : http : //belledenuitmontreal.com/posts/communion/
0	we came here for lunch while touring old montreal and it was pretty nice for a place clearly geared ( and priced ) toward tourists . the hot beverage selection was a nice treat after walking around in the cold winter weather . i was pretty excited about the option of sugarless iced tea . we shared a cheese fondue with herb and sun-dried tomato . it came with a basket of bread , apples , and grapes . it was very tasty , the temperature was good , and the basket of dippables was unlimited . there were a few apple pieces and grapes that bruised , but otherwise tasty . our server was mr. smiley -- he was friendly , prompt , and it was easy to get his attention . the hostess seemed to have too much on her plate -- running around and busing tables to get please seated faster . however , it was strange that we had to wait for a table while the patrons finished up and paid , and then two other parties were seated while we were waiting .
0	my wife and i went there to grab dinner quickly before picking up the kids . we had been wanting to try it for quite some time , but it 's always packed at lunch time . first of all , it took forever for the 2 people working the register to get through a line which was 4 deep at the time . my wife ordered a chicken salad sandwich , i ordered a chicken chop salad , and we got a bowl of cream of broccoli soup to share . again , one person running one ticket at a time , it took forever to get our food . my salad came in a plastic to-go box , set inside of what looked like a salad bowl , with dressing on the side . it was a garden salad , with chopped chicken the sprinkled on top , not a true chicken chop salad one would expect ( if you 've ever had a real , chicken chop salad ) . the salad was n't good , but i was hungry so i ate it . red robin has better salads , by far . my wife said her sandwich tasted like raw white onions . i declined an invitation to verify that point . i then picked up my spoon and dunked it in the broccoli soup , which took an extra ten minutes to get to the table because they had to `` make it fresh '' . it came and was grey in color , and tasted like , well , nothing . seriously , it was bland and tasteless . like a milky water with broccoli floaters . almost lost my garden salad and chopped chicken ... we did take a couple of cookies and an ooey gooey bar to go . i took one bite of the bar and it was marginal . overall this place is awful . save money and get better food at paradise bakery . you know you will get a good meal there . i gave it two stars because the cookies were enjoyed by the kiddos . other than that , i 'm not sure how this place has exploded the way it has . it 's like old country buffet , but without the buffet .
0	this `` new '' location is worse than the one that closed down , down the street . the other day i asked for a mccrib & the drive thru attendant went on and on about how they do n't have it till next week & that it is n't real meat & it does n't have real bbq sauce & questioned me why i would want that sandwich to begin with ! i came back the next day & a different drive thru attendant was equally rude ! if i could , i would give them zero stars .
1	such an awesome show . so much fun to be had . the music is great , the dancing is outstanding and the comedy is top rate .
0	i 'm not a big fan of their burgers but i was a fan of a few other things so will give them another shot . the service was outstanding , the fries are tasty & come in a cute shopping cart . i like the ambiance & the pear ale . prices are a little high for what you get .
0	i called this location today looking for pricing information for mailboxes and a gal had answered the phone ... she sounded quite flustered and said `` i am with a customer so if you call back in 5 mins or stop in the store i can give you information then '' one thing that you never do is make any customer feel as though they are not as important as the customer that they are currently helping . i called the location on tropicana and found better results and will be taking my business there . scratching this location off my list .
0	i 'd give this zero stars if i could ! this is twice i have come to the coffee and donut place only to find out they are out of the box o'joe ! i wo n't be giving this location any more of my time . craig road location , please do n't fail me ! !
0	crap . crap crap . crap . is that not sufficient ? do you need more than that ? okay : go there and order a reuben , and see what happens . first , they 'll ask you what type of bread you want . on my reuben ? i 'll take rye , because if it is n't rye then it 's not a reuben . thank you . then they will include lunch meat-style corned beef , which just pisses me off . because it does n't taste delicious , it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria . and then they have thick ass bread , which , in my opinion , is what you put on a sandwich when you do n't want people to realize that what 's in between the slices of bread sucks ass . or , the nachos . they use movie theater cheese ( which is a one-star bonus for me , only reason they have 2 stars ) but the chili is totally tasteless . i do n't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing . not bad , not good , just * nothing . * here 's a tip : find something that tastes and heave it into the pot . just a thought . i hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices . because the place sucked a fat one .
0	i feel like a pig eating at the trough - that 's the kind of food u get from this buffet after 2.5 hours wait . do n't waste your time and belly . go somewhere else unless you like to be a pig - oink , oink , oink .
0	the worst sushi and bad service super rude on the sushi it 's 99 % rice and 1 % fish very old fish , bad flavors
0	this was the worst restaurant i have ever been to . service was atrocious and food was bland . on my enchiladas they did n't even use real cheese . waited over 20 minutes to get silverware and a drink refill .
0	if you want to be squished by hundreds of sweaty strangers with out even room to dance then come here . the restaurant is nice and i like the atmosphere the club has but tao needs to seriously crowd control they let too many people in too fast , i was over it after 30 min . not to mention the quality of people we ran into , maybe it was just random but this fat drunk mexican literally feel on top of my girlfriend . my gf playfully smacked her ass when she got up . apparently she did n't like that and started charging at my gf then tried to swing at her . held back by all of her friends she finally stoped acting dumb and went away . i latter saw the same girl trying to dance on the stage where the bouncer kicked her off for being to raunchy . thursday night might be better but i wo n't be going back . i 've heard marquee and xs are much better clubs .
1	finally ! a dollar store that fits the bill ! this shop is nice and clean . tidy . no mess . great product assortment and variety of goods too . had everything in stock that i was looking for . i really like the wide aisles to maneuver your shopping cart . clerks were available and ready to help too . oh , and my wait in line was just a few seconds . high five to this dollar tree store .. keep it up ! !
0	this review is based strictly off their customer service . my wife and i were going out for dinner last night at muramoto . we arrived early ( 5:30p ) to the king street area . so , we thought we would stop by nat spil for a couple pre-dinner cocktails . neither of us had been there before and were excited to give it a try . our initial take was we really liked the atmoshere - seemed very cool . however , as mentioned in other reviews , we soon found that the place was small and a little confusing for us . the place has about 10 tables that i could see and a small bar with about 12 stools . is it a restaurant or a bar ? the reason i bring this up is that when we walked in there were two couples sitting at tables and no one at the bar . one couple had food and other couple just had cocktails . there was no one to greet us when we walked in ( i did n't think that was going to be a big deal but it obvioulsly was ) , so we sauntered over to the bar and ordered a cocktail . after the drinks were poured we thought it might be more comfortable sitting at a table and told the bartendress - `` no problem '' she says . we chose a table in the front window area . it was small but had four sets of silverware . suddenly a waiter appears and asks if it just the two of us tonight . `` yes '' i replied . he lets out a big sigh , and then snatches two of the silverware sets . as he is walking to the cupboard to put them away i notice that he is shaking his head the whole time and is still visible pissed that there is only two of us . he then takes the silverware he just cleared and started slamming/throwing them back into the cupboard drawers . let me take the opportunity to remind you that there were four other customers in this establishment at this point and it was 5:30pm . it 's not like we were occupying prime seats during prime time . so ... the waiter comes back and says , `` what do want for dinner ? '' with an exaggerated roll of his eyes . i said we were just having drinks and would n't be staying long . another hugh sigh and he storms off to his station and takes a big drink from his wine glass . i was surprised to see the waiter drinking at 5:30. i wonder if he paid for that drink or if it was stolen from the establishment 's owner ? ! ? well that pretty much sealed it - not going to have a second drink there . we slammed our cocktails and high tailed it . as we were leaving we had to walk right past him . he never looked up or even acknowledged we were leaving . interestingly enough ... around 8:00p as we were walking back to our car from muramoto , we glanced into the front window of nat spil . it looked they had a whooping crowd of about 6 people . i wonder how many other people left after dealing with that ass-bag waiter ? ! ?
1	there 's no doubt about it , both mamma mia locations deliver some great pizza on the cheap . this mamma mia is now the closer of the two to my house , and at first i was a little worried . i was n't sure if both locations were going to be good , but i 'm not worried anymore . whenever i go there , i get slices . i also usually only spend about $ 6 . to me , that 's awesome when i 'm craving some pizza pie . by the way , mamma mia serves good ol ' fashoined ny-style pizza . their toppings range from traditional ( roni , sausage , veggies ) to fancy ( salmon , bleu cheese , capers ) . i have been known to order capers on my slices ( and they were actually really good ) . normally i ask for the slices well done , and i 'd recommend you do the same if you like that extra bit of crispiness like me . the slices come out relatively quickly , and i 've never been dissatisfied with what i 've been given . i 've yet to try their sandwiches or pastas , but in time i 'm sure i 'll get around to it . at $ 6 or less a pop , i feel like i 've got a good thing going . if i 'm in the mood for pizza and i do n't feel like traveling far or spending much , mamma mia is towards the top of my list .
1	for anyone trying to compare this buffet to one that is double or triple the price , do n't . just get out your fat wallet and move over the strip . for others of us who want decent value with good , everyday food , this is the place . i 'm not overly picky and i like non complicated food that i can identify with , i guess you 'd call it comfort food . i 've been to all those expensive buffets and i still say for the value palace station wins .
0	talk about a disappointment ! i want to first say that our server was amazing and tried his best to give us the best service ever . thank you ! ! my friend and i were hungry after a late night on the town , we were staying at mb and were craving burgers . we got there and were seated right away . my friend ordered the french dip steak and it was horrible ! the meat was dryer than the las vegas heat , no taste ! the soup that came with it was bland and the pasta was disgusting . meanwhile i had the hamburger that had no taste to it . now usually if we were paying a cheap price , you get what you pay for . but these orders were $ 20 bucks a piece . and i understand that it 's late at night , but either lower the price or give us fresh food . we let our server know that we did n't like our food ( we could n't even finish it ) and did n't want anything else . then the manager came and basically told us that they did ask us if we wanted anything else and `` apologized '' . yeah , whatever dude . at the end of it all we did get a cut off our total , but the whole experience was a total let down . if you 're going to be serving food , all i ask is for it to be good . avoiding this place from now on .
1	i have been going to the matador since i was in grade school . they have consistently good no-frills mexican food and i much prefer it over the chain locations that are around . it 's a nice large location downtown and has been renovated since many of the reviews on here were posted . yes , the service has been slow from time to time over the years but i have n't ever had any more trouble here than at most other restaurants . it 's a locally owned family business that has been in the family for over 30 years . if you 're looking for something gourmet , then this is not your place . if you are looking for the mexican version of comfort food , give it a try !
0	it 's denny 's -- how bad can it be ? well let me tell you ... this visit to denny 's was b.a.d . it was over 90 minutes from start to finish and we were seated immediately on a weekday morning . food came out s.l.o.w and our server was even slower . we did n't get refills nor were they even offered . my husband 's pancakes were burnt on the outside and still runny on the inside . the fruit that came with my breakfast had been frozen and was n't quite thawed out yet . i have eaten at this denny 's before and while the service has never been all that stellar , this was by far the worst visit to a denny 's i 've ever experienced and because it 's denny 's my expectations are pretty low to begin with . do yourself a favor and skip this particular denny 's . you will save yourself the aggravation .
1	i 've wanted to check this place out after watching the las vegas episode of man vs. food . not to mention my cousin constantly raves abou this place , so that definitely sparked my interest even more . i did n't wait long because my cousin already had a table before i got there . ordered a pound and a half of shrimp and a side of french fries . mmmm good ! the only weird thing is they provide clear plastic gloves to wear when you eat the food , i mean for obvious reasons of course ! however the gloves are optional . i prefer to use my bare hands ! would i come back ? that would be a definite yes !
0	i 'll be honest . i walked out of this show . the music was way too loud for me . the bass was pounding so hard my chest was vibrating . my ears were hurting . i was in the middle section , so not as if i were next to speakers . i generally love cirque shows and i like michael jackson music . but not this show . i did not enjoy the visual aspect of the show -- mind you i could only take 30 minutes and finally just had to leave . sorry to say this was a bad experience for me .
0	being from the east coast and living in nyc i 've never been curious about cpk . but stuck in an airport for a few hours and hungry , i decided to give it a try . comfortable seating area with a bar and the hostess saw me holding my laptop and automatically seated me near an outlet . very nice . the service was really mixed though . i was asked to pay my bill while i was still eating ( i was n't eating slowly or anything ) . it was a pain because my hands were kind of greasy and pizza-covered . the pizza is decent . the crust tastes like really high-quality frozen pizza though . i 'd be very surprised if it was anything but just that . the toppings and combination were great and i scarfed the whole personal size pie down . overall reminds me a bit of a higher-end papa john 's pizza . it ca n't really compare to a nyc slice -- chain pizzerias just get their own category and based on that , cpk is alright .
0	i love the fact that this location stays open later than the mesa location ( probably due to its proximity to asu ) . but it just could n't top my experience at the location in mesa . if you order the deep dish crust pizza , be careful ! we had no idea it would have so much cheese . we thought the cheese would just be in the crust but it was all along the bottom of the whole crust . my body was n't feeling that and fearing that we would `` pay for it in the morning '' , we asked for a flat crust pizza as a replacement . the manager was really great about accommodating us ( thank you ! ) but unfortunately in all the confusion , the waiter forgot to put in our order for the pizza cookie which we ordered as soon as we sat down * sad face * . we wound up going back to the original location in mesa the next week and yummed that up !
1	best cheese curds of my life . same goes for beer cheese soup . basically , if you 're into cheese , run do n't walk to this restaurant . things to note : -fairly large portion sizes , so keep that in mind when you order . -cheese curds -they have gluten-free bread , and 3 choices of it at that ! -prices are amazing . we had a filling meal for 4 people for under 70 bucks . -did i mention cheese curds ?
1	i 'm the girly girly-ist tom boy you 'll ever meet . sitting through an hour of getting my nails done is pure hell to me . pedicures are not `` relaxation time '' for me , it 's `` pain in the ass time '' . i hate getting my hair done and i ca n't stand shopping . i 'd rather be out drinking whiskey and shooting pool . all of this is very difficult for me you understand , because at the same time i like to be pretty . this is where dv comes in to save the day ( or at least my hands and feet ) le is my nail tech . i only go to her though i can say i 've had pedi 's from some of the other ladies and they 're all quite thorough . i 'm insanely picky about my nails . it borders on ocd ( no joke ) . le is extremely detail oriented and my nails turn out perfect every time . it 's always packed in there and that is a testament to quality of product if you ask me . the prices are comparable to anywhere else you might go though i do n't recommend going anywhere else . it 's close to home and afterward i can make a quick run over to old navy ( one of the few places i can stomach shopping ) it 's still a pain in the ass .... the whole damn thing ... but at least my fingers and toes look cute . ( god , that was the most stupid `` chick '' thing that has ever come out of my mouth ) i 'm glad i could share it with you .
0	not great mexican food , bad customer service .
0	my letter to wells fargo : wells fargo attn : branch manager 3002 n central ave phoenix , az , 85012 to whom it may concern , i understand the customer is not always right . i understand that i am not now , nor will i ever be your best , most profitable customer . i do n't make a lot of money , i am living paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet . i am trying to get back on my feet to where i can live without floating one bill to pay another . i have a second chance account and i am trying to do the best so i can transition to a regular account . but none of this means your employees have the right to treat me like a second class citizen . you have to understand that in customer service , when a customer has a good experience , they tell one to two people . when the customer has a great experience they tell 3 to 4 people . on the opposite end of the spectrum . when a customer has a bad experience , they tell 10 to 12 people and when they have a horrible experience , they take to social media where they are visible to hundreds or even thousands of people . i am a relatively new customer to wells fargo . since opening my accounts , i have been in several times for various transactions , usually depositing a paycheck ( which are now direct deposited ) , and have really always received world-class service from your employees from the moment i would walk in , to the moment i left . yesterday was a completely different story . i will start by apologizing , as i was out of line at the end of the transaction . i drove off and flipped the teller off . i strongly feel though , that my actions at the end of this transaction do not validate your employees ' treatment of me at the beginning of the transaction . i was in a great mood because i finally received my tuition assistance check for $ 3669.00 from arizona state university where i am a student . i rushed over to make it to your branch before they closed . i went through the drive through , only wanting to deposit this check . my friend and i waited for 10 minutes . the teller never apologized for the wait or explained what the hold up was , she just left us waiting . i am still in a great mood at this point though . finally she comes back and advises simply that my check is being held . i ask why and until what date . this is when the conversation goes downhill . she tells me it is on hold until tuesday because i have a second chance bank account and the check is from bank of america and if i do n't like that , i can go next door to bank of america . are you kidding me ? her first reaction is to tell me to take my business elsewhere ? ? who does that ? ? she was so condescending and rude i was shocked . but i let it go and collected my id , debit card and receipt . i noticed the receipt read the deposit was $ 3669 and that $ 3469 was being held . i pressed the call button and asked the teller about the $ 200 difference . she was clearly irritated with me at that point and tells me the entire amount is on hold as it clearly states on my receipt . i tell her its not clear on my receipt , that 's why i am asking . she responds by telling me she is going to get her manager . what ? are you serious ? up to now , i have not talked back to her , i have not raised my voice , i have been completely respectful . the manager comes over . i try asking my questions again and she cuts me off saying as it clearly states on your receipt sir , the entire amount is being held . i say again , its not clear on my receipt . she again cuts me off and tells me its clear on my receipt . she cut me off and repeated herself 3 times . i was so furious i drove off and that is when i flipped her off . again my apologies , but again , this does not validate how i was treated . i went into the branch as soon as they opened this morning and spoke with a manager . as soon as i told her i had gone through the drive through last night , she stopped me and said oh , `` you 're the guy that flipped off my employees ? '' and proceeds to lecture me as though i am a child and basically threatened to kick me out of the branch . again , i had not raised my voice this entire time . she finally lets me explain what happened , and though she is verbally apologetic , it is clear she could absolutely care less . in fact , several times , she kept saying i do n't know why they would have talked to you like that , i do n't know what the circumstances were . there were no circumstances that i should have ever been treated like that . yes i flipped them off , but that was at the very end of the transaction as i was driving away . the manager never asked for my name or phone number , never said she would get back to me if she has other questions . she was just giving me lip service , and barely made any real effort at that . normally i can forgive and forget , but these two interactions from three employees are unforgivable and i am now questioning my loyalty as a customer . what reason do i have to stay ? sincerely , lucas r .

0	this used to be the best pizza in the valley . the last two times we went we were disappointed . the first time the pepperoni had no flaver . this last time the italian sausage had no flavor . the basic pizza is still good .
0	this place can be summed up in one word - awful . in a search to find a good sushi spot in las vegas , i came upon sumo . walking in , i took a look at the menu and decided to give it a shot . looking at the ayce menu , i decided to go with a la carte . thank god i did . ordering a few simple rolls , they came out promptly but were warm and soggy - the opposite of fresh . all rolls were chewy ( should have ordered soy paper for the extra charge ) and the philly roll had enough cream cheese to choke a horse . add to this the fact that the waters came out in dirty glasses with no ice and that gives a full snapshot of the meal . once i stomach down a few pieces , i looked down to find my napkin and unfortunately saw the sides of the `` white '' table cloth . these resembled a scene out of csi . immediately asking for the check , we walked out with no intent on returning and very thankful we steered clear of the ayce option . the only reason this review has 2 stars is because the staff is very friendly , constantly smiling and always prompt when refilling our tap water .
0	rude and incompetent security + outdated room + poor management this is a one-star coming from a person who could n't care less when it comes to hotel rooms . i 've stayed at the motel 6 and was even fine with it , so to say that my experience at motel 6 trumps my experience at the caesars palace really means something . 1. outdated rooms . step up your game , caesars . even circus circus has all their rooms fully renovated . 2. all our room keys suddenly stopped working the second night even though we had the room checked out for three nights . what ? we were extremely tired and all we wanted to do was come back for some rest , but were locked out and had to inconveniently go downstairs to be issued new keys . 3. after working in customer service for more than seven years , i have a lot of empathy for the people who work behind the counter . i understand there are some bad days and some customers just ask for it , but what i got from the incompetent security guard was unacceptable and uncalled for . all i wanted to do was to pick up a binder that was left behind by my friend who had the room checked out to her . my friend spoke to the hotel manager about the situation prior to my arrival and he told her to let me know the procedure : go to security - get housekeeping involved - get the binder . this security guard made my life so much harder by playing games , asking who specifically stayed in the room even when i gave him the name of who the room was checked out to , saying the room was n't checked out to her even though it was , playing with the pronunciation of names , making me walk all the way to the front desk even though he knew the power was in his hands to just call housekeeping up for the item , making up `` issues '' even though the hotel manager clearly said those were n't issues to begin with . basically , this guy just wanted to come off as if he knew everything and made up his own procedures to kill his boredom . i ultimately got the item after more than an hour of dealing with his incompetence and his need to go on a power trip . 4. no apology from the hotel manager even though he knew exactly what the dbag security guard was doing . to top it all off , this whole security fiasco made it a sour start to my birthday . i recommend this place to no one .
0	this is my first review . i recently rented through hertz using aaa . with using aaa , you pay a good portion of your rental up front . i reserved a standard car and was left with an `` estimated '' balance of $ 80 . this total price was inline with most of the other major rental agencies , including tax , as far as price was concerned . when i signed my agreement the total balance was $ 166 not $ 80 . when i asked about this i was rudely told that the $ 80 was estimated , even though it was double , and welcome to arizona . the next thing i was told that my car was a yaris , the smallest car that toyota makes . i tried to argue this , but was told it their `` standard '' car . when i got to where the car was i asked someone else , who said that i was supposed to have gotten a `` mid size . '' so now i am driving a versa , the smallest nissan car made , and paying $ 80 more than their closet competitor for a `` standard '' car and $ 100 more than a `` mid size . '' i will never rent from hertz again .
1	i 've been here so many times i 've lost count . but i do remember the first time we tried disc golfing several years ago and actually bought our very first discs from this place . they were very helpful in showing us the basics and how get a good drive as a beginner . the have a great selection of discs . also they manage a lost and found for discs , especially since so many discs go missing in the pond at vista del camino . i 've recovered several of my discs because of it ! you can buy cheaper discs online , but you ca n't put a price on the great service and knowledge they have here .
1	simply fantastic , been here 4 days straight since they opened , the lemon custard is amazing in their banana splits . i would go every day .
1	i was really impressed with this hotel on my recent trip to vegas for a girls weekend . the hotel itself is very impressive , the decor is amazing and so well thought out . the hotel is fairly new so does n't have that haggard look but actually they 've kept it up well . the casino is open and airy ( not smokey at all ) and somehow does n't feel as claustrophobic as other casinos in vegas . the rooms are great ! very modern with mirrors everywhere and clean lines . remote control drapes and sheers as well as lights . we stayed in a king suite so had the benefit of a separate living room with a couch . it was nice to be able to have a pregame cocktail without having to sit on a bed . the bathroom was gorgeous , double sinks , large tub , shower with two heads and lots of nice bath products ( although the shampoo and conditioner could be upgraded ) . i laughed when i read another reviewers comment about the toilet being too high , i felt the same way ! like a little kid with my legs dangling ! the toilet is a little aggressive too when you flush , but who 's complaining ? ? the pools are nice . they have options , you can go to the family pool or the `` european '' pool ( bikini tops optional ) . you can also use pools at wynn . the younger crowd pools are fun with pumping music and hot bodies everywhere . the family pools are more relaxing and peaceful . both have free water and towels and plenty of servers to bring you a cocktail , although you 'll pay dearly for it ! i will say the pool areas are lacking good food options , all of the items on the menu are premade sandwiches and salads and did n't appeal to me . the restaurants inside the hotel are great , although again pretty pricey ( what do you expect ? ? ) . they all have an asian flair but the two we ate in , wazuzu and wing lei were great ! the crowd is younger on the weekend and apparently xs and tryst are two of the hottest clubs in town so be prepared to see a bunch of young girls in too short dresses and walking around barefoot after they gave in to their 6 inch platform heels ( yeah i 'm not bitter ! lol ) . of all the hotels in vegas i have stayed at , i would definitely go back here .
0	went here for the first time for dinner . my husband and i walked in the restaurant and , even thought the restaurant was empty with 3 employees behind the counter , no one greeted us . since this was our first visit we looked over the menu . none of the employees offered any help or asked if we had any questions . after standing at the counter for about 5 minutes finally one of the employees said they could take our order . we ordered our food to go . the sandwiches were very good but the customer service could use a little help . since we did like the food we will give this place another chance .
1	loving this place . yah it 's a chain . so what ? they provide a quality product at a fair price consistantly . the chianti is great with any pasta on the menu . i always opt for the `` create your own pasta '' . very reasonable and you can pick from four sauces , five or six pastas and add veggies , meat whatever you want . not a bad deal . home baked bread is 5 stars !
0	zero stars , if i could give it . this place sucks . the waitress shows up to take your order , drop off your food and give you a check . does n't stop by to see if you need anything . place is filthy . food is terrible . service horrible . will never return to a long wongs restaurant .
1	they have so much in their store it sometimes takes a while to get through it . from kid items ( pokemon etc ) to very adult themed items in the back . they are located at the galleria mall upstairs near the food court very friendly and helpful staff . i found a minion iphone case there and love it ! ! !
1	our first visit to this place was great . very clean , friendly service , and good food . i 'm a bacon snob but i must say their bacon was perfect ! i had the small french toast plate which was just enough food because one slice of french toast is huge ! it 's crispy fried sourdough french toast which sounds different but was absolutely delicious ! my fianc\u00e9 had the 5 egg white scramble and loved it but again tons of food , he could n't eat the whole thing . orange juice is fresh squeezed ( you can literally watch the kids squeezing it ) so it 's pulpy but has the great fresh flavor . overall , awesome ! we will definitely be back ! ask for jocelyn 's section .
1	i do n't know what else to add that has n't already been covered . this made-to-order frozen dessert place is entertaining and an exercise in patience . watching the ice pan folks slap your ( non ) dairy atoms on the icepan is definitely a fun show . of course , all the while you 're watching , you 're wishing that the process would just hurry-up-a-bit-because-you-really-want-your-dessert ! choose from your choice of dairy milk or non-dairy milk , then select your choice of flavour , then decide upon the topping ( s ) . no preservatives or additives ( except what may be in the toppings -- oreos , reese pb cups , etc . ) and all made in front of your eyes in about 2 minutes . ( i timed it . ) it 's too bad that one has to fight through the harrah 's smoky casino to get to ice pan , but it 's worth it . be prepared to wait a while ; we checked out ice pan on a weekday during the late afternoon and despite being 2 of about 5 people in the queue , it still took about 15 minutes for the ice pan folks to start our order . we forgot that pain as soon as we tasted our dessert though . : )
1	i am a self proclaimed foodie and i do n't mess around when it comes to food . basil and garlic bistro is the real deal . i have been here three times and have ordered three different dishes , all were fantastic . the first time i was here i ordered the meatball sandwich and it was so flavorful , lightly toasted on the outside , the meatballs were perfectly seasoned , the cheese was flavorful and of great quality . i was so full after eating the first half that i saved the other half for dinner . i did n't want to ruin the delicious sandwich by reheating it in the microwave so i turned on the oven and patiently waited to once again experience the intoxicating scent of an almost fresh meatball sandwich . it was just as good as the first bite !
0	called to make an appointment . was asked what insurance i have and told her i did n't have insurance . she said dr. venkat was n't currently taking cash patients . wtf ! seems kinda rude .
1	warning : awesome place for a date ! ! ! honestly , if you have an adventurous pallet and do n't want the normal fair one night then you have to try soul . anyone that gives this place less than 4 stars is downright out of their mind ! i am extremely picky about the freshness of food , ambiance , pleasantness of staff , and pricing of food . soul 's staff is always a pleasure to speak with and of the 5-6x i have been there , each meal has been nothing short of excellent ! if you do not try soul gastrolounge then you are really missing out !
0	cheap beer and interesting crowd that go there . it 's in freemont - downtown .
1	next time you 're in vegas , do yourself a favor and see a show at the pearl ! we saw tool here on their final show of their tour ... it was absolutely mindblowing . small venue ... there really is n't a bad seat in the house and as mentioned from others , the acoustics are amazing . my only complaint was that i just happened to sit next to two chain-smokers ... but they were super drunk , got into a lover 's quarrel and left halfway through the concert .... so , yay !
1	i love , love , love lux coffee . ca n't drink it there as the place is always too packed . could sit on the front patio but it 's tooooo hot right now . so i take it with me which is fine . their coffee is the best in the valley as far as i 'm concerned ( ok the lgo spanish latte is also dang good ) . i have learned to embrace the multiple body piercings as part of the extreme coffee deluxe picture . that coffee , it 's enough to melt a girls heart . the chocolate chip cookies were incredible at one time . do n't know if they still are . the woman who used to make them had her mother or grandmothers receipe . as for the rest of their heavenly offerings , have n't had a bad calorie laden snack there yet .
0	i would give this little establishment 3.21 stars . the good : everything is very pleasant to the eyes , from the look of the place to all the colors of the pastries . the sweets are also very good . the not so good : it 's often crowded and there may be long lines and seating may be hard to find . the prices are also pretty high , but you have to expect that . i 've tried a bunch of their muffins and breaded pastries , and to be honest , i feel this place is more hype than substance . sure , it looks good , but taste wise , it 's nothing special . the coffee i had is forgettable , especially at $ 4 something for an iced coffee . that , in my opinion , was the biggest rip off . you 're better off getting something sweet and getting the drinks elsewhere . actually , skip all the danishes/drinks here if you can . the sweets , like the raspberry tart , are what stands out here . overall : it 's an anna kournikova , it looks good , but it 's not a winner . but i guess i 'm a typical guy , i 'm giving the stars mostly on the looks .
0	you ever feel so embarrassed for someone you want to crawl under the table for them ? that pretty much sums up this experience . there was nothing `` awesome '' about this . my friend had free tickets so i agreed to go , i am very hesitant to pay for any shows coming out of planet hollywood because most are a waste of money . let me tell you , if i paid $ 49.99 for this crap i would have been livid . we were all pretty excited to see this show as we did n't really know anything except it was supposed to be interactive kinda like tony & tina 's wedding except for no food is served . so we enter the `` showroom '' i '' m putting quotes around the because it was literally a room that was divided in half , possibly the other side is being used for a different show ? the decorations were clearly from party city and made to look like a high school auditorium with a prom theme . the actors were all attempting to be a character out of all the famous 80 's movies , but it was a very poor attempt . basically the idea of this show was you are at prom , you vote for prom king and queen and you are supposed to interact with the actors . now i use the word actors loosely because i 've seen better plays put on when i was in junior high school in the dreaded drama class i was forced to take . in our group there were 10 of us , within 15 minutes we all wanted to leave , but being there was only about 25 people at the show , we did n't want to leave all at once because it would have been noticable and we did n't want to get harassed . speaking of harassing , that 's all that was happening . now i 'm not a wallflower and i like to get down with 80 's music just as much as the next guy , but i do n't want to be followed around and pretend that i 'm enjoying interacting with the people when i 'm really not . very little seating , very small bar , with minimal choices , the dj and security guy walking around were giving me the creeps as well dressed all in black/goth type drama club . i would n't come back nor would i recommend .
1	large portions , the line moves quickly , great outdoor seating where my wild kids can roam free ( watch out for them climbing the fence to get to the oh so tempting playground in the middle of traffic ) , and the food is outstanding . my favorite is the brisket . so tender with a touch of crunchiness in just the right places .
0	i do n't get it no . really . i. just . do n't . get . it . alright , so maybe i 'm not a hamburger fan - but i am when it 's good , prime , juicy , beef ( like kobe , for instance ) . and the fries ? ! o. m. g .... d r y ! that said : the service is very cool . top notch . days gone by . anyone i have visit from canada is in awe when i take them here - and i do it serisouly for the service experience - oh , and when i get `` is there a burger place around '' ( g r o a n ...... here we go again .... ) so , aunite & uncle were happy . i did n't even touch a fry . sorry . gr8 service ( as usual ) today - kudos ... and high 5 to ya 's
1	levant just opened in the uptown mint museum building . in the side of the building , actually , directly across from the knight theater 's massive outdoor screen . it 's owned by the same folks that own and run kabob grill . i 've only been once , and it was for take-out , but it was delicious . everyone was really eager to help . my wrap was hot and fresh . and when i brought it back to the office , it smelled so good that people from all over the office came by to see check things out . i ordered the kafta wrap . the hummus tasted really fresh , and the beef was tender and flavorful . the fries were nice , too . crispy on the outside and seasoned just right . i 'll definitely try it again , next time for eat-in . this end of downtown charlotte has really become energized with all sorts of new places to eat . i wish them plenty of success .
0	first , i should start by saying that this spa is the most beautiful spa facility i have ever been to . the facilities are spacious and beautiful and there is literally not a single amenity missing . unfortunately , i can not give such rave reviews to the facial services . i spent the day yesterday at the spa with a few girlfriends . we had lunch on the spa pool terrace and then spent several hours enjoying the amenities . i was very much looking forward to my facial . however , my 50 minute facial was incredibly disappointing . the esthetician did not ask me a single question about my skin or ask if there was anything i wanted to focus on . she then proceeded to slather a mask on my face and let me sit under the steam for a solid 10 minutes . i think she probably spent a total of 15 of the 50 minutes actually working on my face . the rest of the time was spent on a shoulder and neck massage and a lengthy hand massage . the massage was fine , but that 's not what i signed up for . when it came time for extractions , she did maybe four extraction on my nose and that was it . nothing else . i would be ok with this if i truly had nothing to extract , but when i went to look at myself in the mirror i could visibly see blackheads still in my face . i really wanted to give joya a rave review , but i just ca n't . i have probably had 20 facials in my life and i can honestly say this was the worst one ever . my friend had a lovely massage and was very happy with the results , and i also had a manicure with sheryl who was awesome . i would recommend joya for the ambience and possibly some other services , but would absolutely look elsewhere for a quality facial .
0	pittsburgh , oh pittsburgh . union pig & chicken is a great try at southern style food , but it just falls short . the cornbread was too dry and really sweet ( which i tend to favor , but this was too much ) and the mac & cheese could have been better , it was too gritty for my taste . the chicken however was quite good , but not worth what i paid for it considering the mediocre side dishes . another gripe i had was that there was no one there to seat us . we waited for 3-5 minutes , then just decided to seat ourselves , then waited another 6 minutes for a waitress to come over , even after i had caught her eye , she did n't come over . that really annoys me more than anything . you should be on top of seating people at the minimum . i 'll probably give it a second try , but i honestly was n't impressed . i would rather drive the 8 hours down to asheville and eat in a gas station bbq . sorry guys .
1	i must speak of the wobbly stone . every day for three days , i would meet my girlfriend outside of the edinburgh 's christmas fair ( or simply called edinburgh christmas -- copy/pasted from here on in ) . i found this loose tile in the sidewalk a few feet from the gateway . it was mildly distracting to balance upon said stone and wobble back and forth while i waited . i did n't move until she arrived . and when she did , we would turn and , locked in arms , pass under the arch of the christmas fair . what an amazing stroke of luck . the day after i arrived in edinburgh , the edinburgh christmas fair opened up . occupying most of princes street gardens , the edinburgh christmas is basically dozens of booths selling various foods and trinkets with the odd christmas themed recreational event thrown in for good measure . this includes an ice rink , a ferris wheel , a carousel and a theater which i never entered . the main draws are the booths , dozens of them . a few other reviews have been critical of the event , claiming that it 's lost some its charm . what these people do n't appreciate is how impressive the event is when compared to others found in smaller venues ... like my home town . what i 'm saying is that even if the edinburgh christmas has lost some appeal , it still remains an amazing attraction if one finds him or herself in edinburgh in the winter . what i appreciate the most is that the edinburgh christmas caters to those wishing to wander in a chilly but not uncomfortable evening for a few hours looking for unique experiences to enjoy . i strolled through the fair several times during my vacation and found it satisfying each time . i admit there is considerable duplication ; several vendors market identical items such as candle holders and hats at identical prices . however , there are still numerous unique booths you 'd have to search to find . only one sells authentic big pretzels while another singular table sells novelty notebooks and ipad covers . i bought three wheels of cheese from one vender near the entrance . a personal favorite were a pair of boisterous men with beards selling various foreign chocolates , exclaiming them to the passing crowds . excluding the novelty shops , i must take moment to talk about the food venders , selling everything from mulled wine , to cotton candy , to french crepes drenched in molten nutella , to bratwurst as long as your arm . although some people refer to this as a german festival , i noticed as many representations from the netherlands . i enjoyed poffertjes and the aforementioned french crepes drenched in hazelnut chocolate sauce . the girlfriend and i took a ride on the ferris wheel , lifting us into an amazing vista of edinburgh 's horizon a few minutes after sunset . and it feels like christmas . i bought the novelty notebook . i bought the wheels of cheese . i enjoyed the polish krakowska . if i had more time , i could have purchased more , eaten more , regardless of how disappointing this festival was over others which edinburgh boasts . i would have taken the girlfriend on the carousel she so badly wanted to ride . if this what accounts for a small fair -- a disappointing fair -- then i can not wait to return to edinburgh in the future and see what their good fairs look like .
1	how on earth have i not reviewed this gem ! do not be fooled by outward appearances . it is very unassuming but once you get inside , it is a beautiful steakhouse . they have not one but two happy hours ! my friend and i come here to spoil ourselves . $ 30 each for a nice steak a side and glass of wine . they have a fantastic wine list and a steak to please everyone . they will cook it any temperature you want ... including gag .. blue : ) but if that 's what you like , you can find it here ! be naughty and get the cookie sundae . ooey gooey chocolate chip cookies covered in creamy vanilla ice cream . you 're welcome .
0	this place is a complete rip off . they charge 4 small tacos and even a single quesadilla for approximately 11-12 dollars and the cheapest food on their menu is a small house salad for 7 dollars that i can easily make at home from grocery produce that i can buy from a super market . i went with a few yelpers after a large event and upon arrival the place was pretty well lit , clean , and cozy ; but i was surprised at their menu because it was incredibly limited and devoid of any substantial variety . it took them around 40 minutes for them to finally finish cooking our meals and from looking at all the dishes that the other yelpers , ordered they looked incredibly small . no single dish could even seem as though it could satisfy anyone 's hunger . i believe that you need to order at least 3 or more ( which means more spending ! ) to even accomplish such a simple endeavor . also , the service staff members were kind of creepy . sure , they all wore nice fancy dress shirts and ties , but we could all tell that they were simply pretending to act nice towards us so we wo n't complain about spending money on their overly priced foods . they also seemed to enjoy talking in a high pitched vocal tonality for some strange apparent reason ( not that they are necessarily brown nosers of course : p ) . it 's easy enough to simply acted as though they cared , but there were very few people in the venue and i could not believe the tremendous amount of time they took to make our food . they only exception i can guarantee is the variety of exotic alcohol drinks that seemed to fill up 1/3 of their menu and of course their fancy environment , but this place is pretty small regardless . i would wish that a better restaurant could occupy mundo 's space because of their grand location near the world market center but i 'll just avoid this spot for now . the only advice that i could give is to go try this place out yourself or if this review managed to fully convince you how terrible this place was , it 's better to go buy your own groceries or even travel to ihop/dennys for a more superior experience .
1	i 'm a regular here for their thursday night trivia and we always have a great time . their menu is more than the typical bar food you might expect . lots of salad choices , some wraps , and the pizza is decent . it 's a great place to see a game since there 's a tv in every direction but it can get pretty packed given that its one of the few sports bar in somo . i did see a drunkard punch out one of the huge windows out front one sunday night . that was exciting !
0	stopped in for a slice with my son , large slice of pizza , generous toppings , a tad on the greasy side , but most likely due to the pepperoni . all in all , thought it was good . food came out quickly , will stop in an try something else next time ... oh yea , no fountain drinks ..... for me a negative
1	phoenix house painting just completed a complete exterior repaint of my home and i could n't be more pleased . i highly recommend them . the owner , john morris , is a veteran of the paint industry . the guys that work for him are smart , efficient , careful and quick . my home looks brand new and the best part is they offer a 10 year warranty on their workmanship and materials . stop by and take a look . they are the best ! ! !
0	the two stars are for my massage therapist ( janice ) who was absolutely amazing ! one of the best massages i 've had . she was magic . if you get a massage i highly recommend her . the spa was a glorified bathroom for the most part . the spa attendants were n't very attentive once they checked you in . i could see and hear them mostly talking to each other behind the counter most of the time . the steam room probably fits 3 people comfortably , the sauna is a little bigger and would fit more . the bathrooms are literally in the same area . not much privacy . they have hydro tubs , also all in the same room . but charge to use them , which seems unfair since the men 's lockers has a complimentary jacuzzi . i was there for several hours and never saw anyone use the hydro tub , probably because it was overpriced and not very private as it sat in the middle of the room with a shower curtain around it . then when it was time for my massage i was taken out of the spa area and through the gym . kind of awkward in my bathrobe while people were working out watching me walk through in a robe . if you want to enjoy a fabulous massage you will not be disappointed , but do n't expect much from the day spa portion .
0	i really hate to do this , but i have to . service was slower than slow . my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese . turkey chili was lukewarm and not as good as it should have been . the staff seemed gloomy and sad . it just was n't a good experience . it really is too bad , i have n't had lunch at a einstein 's in forever and i was hoping it would be as good as i remember it .
0	came back here recently , about 9 months since my last trip . disappointed , i must say . quality has gone downhill , it seems . fish not as fresh as last visit , and rolls have taken on a more is less approach . that is , pile on more goop but give 'em less fish . the sauces are overwhelming , sticky and sweet . i do n't remember this the last visit . the sauces should complement the fish , not drown it .
1	really chill hotel . no complaints from me .
1	i go here regularly for their salmon salads and steak salads , so good ! , never have any issues . i had a little situation last time with my food ( my half empty lobster and shrimp bisque had no shrimp , and my steak salad came out with cold steak , half the salad drenched with sauce , the other half dry ) , and i asked our waiter ( who was very nice and a good waiter ) if he could get a manager over to us . being a regular , i was curious if they had switched chefs or something since i was having so many issues . she saw my salad , apologized , and brought me back a new fresh one immediately ( waiting there the whole time while it was being made ) . she also took care of our lobster bisque . great food , and great customer service , gives then 5stars . every restaurant has an off day here and there , but the way the situation was handled will keep me a regular at this place !
0	we tried pizza peel because they are opening closer to us in plaza midwood and it was very disappointing . i did not care for the pizza ; too sweet and the crust very doughy . the nachos were some of the worst i 've had , even though the server said they were very good . they are made with a cheese sauce which was lukewarm at best , the chips stale and the presentation awful . i like real cheese on my nachos . the menu does n't say it has beans but there are beans all over it . the beer list is above average . the service very flat . lucky for them there are n't many good restaurants in cotswold . plaza midwood on the other hand is a different story .
0	found out this place is closing and i am not very surprised . it seemed to lack a good atmosphere and the coffee was not that impressive . best of luck to the owners , check out crossroads books and coffee to support a local shop in the burbs instead .
0	tried the clubhouse burger . yuck , the flavors do n't blend , the bun tasted weird , too much sauce that was not complimentary to the sandwich , long story short did n't like . gave it a thumbs down to manager , who seemed un interested when i told her that we ate only a third of the sandwiches we purchased .
1	we went for restaurant week and it was amazing ! gigantic portions great food and the server was so friendly and warm ! we would not normally go to the epicenter but for this place we will be back !
0	this place is the main setting of one of the most miserable nights of my life that did n't involve someone dying or me throwing up on my date or something . anyway , i 'll spare those details and just focus on what a terrible experience this restaurant was . to begin let me state in the interest of full disclosure that i live in dallas . this affords me the opportunity to eat some damn fine tex-mex , but it does not make me a mexican snob . i 'm every bit as comfortable eating at a chain in my native st. louis as i am at some of the better places i have found in dallas or anywhere else . all i ask is that it is good . frank and lupe 's is not good . the people in my party wanted mexican and several people affiliated with our hotel recommended frank and lupe 's as the `` best mexican in town ! ! '' i see that in some of the reviews here , too . either these people are getting kick backs or scottsdale has a seriously terrible mexican restaurant scene . first off , upon our arrival we were quoted a wait time of 35 minutes inside and an hour on the patio . ok , guess we 're eating inside , no problem . unfortunately , 35 minutes turned into nearly an hour to sit in the hot , cramped dining area . we would have been much better off waiting for the patio and taking our chances . there are few restaurant sins bigger than undershooting the wait time by almost half . off by 5 or 10 minutes ? still crappy but it happens . 20+ minutes ? no excuse . this highlights another problem with this place . it is tiny . there is no place to wait . i guess we could have squeezed into the over-full patio and hoped for the best , but otherwise you 're standing out on the street on a tiny crowded sidewalk with all the other unfortunate souls about to be subjected to the horrors that are apparently `` the best mexican in town '' . as you can imagine , after waiting an hour for a table , our party was starving . luckily we were at a mexican place , so we knew we were getting chips and salsa , so we waited ... and waited ... and waited and finally we hounded the hostess after 10 minutes of sitting there with nothing on the table . then we got the `` chips '' which were actually more like some thick bastard offspring of a chip and a taco bell chalupa shell . did i mention they were cold , too ? warm chips can hide a magnitude of crimes , but not at frank and lupe 's . and the salsa was some watery , runny mess . yuck . and what 's that i see on the menu ? $ 2 for more chips ? luckily the chips were terrible and they would have had to pay me $ 2 to take more of them , but seriously ? no one i have mentioned this to since has ever seen a charge for chips at a mexican restaurant . was i reading this wrong ? is this only if i do n't order anything besides chips ? surely it was , right ? moving on ... after another good 10 minutes our waiter finally came around for our orders . i ordered a number 6. i was presented a choice of a green or red sauce . being from out of town i asked for the waiter 's opinion . he told me he would get the red but `` its a little spicy . '' this is important because it was the exaggeration of the century . before the meal came out i had finished my first diet coke . of course i did because it was like 30 minutes between getting the diet coke and getting the food . anyway , i specifically waited for another diet coke before i started the `` little spicy '' meal . then i dig in and i eat ... and i eat ... and i eat . in fact , i finished the entire entree before i even felt a hint of spice in my mouth , and even then it was n't much more robust than medium pace picante sauce . huge disappointment . to tell the truth , the whole meal was bland . there was basically no flavor even under the `` little spicy '' ( emphasis on little , i guess ) sauce and the rice was apparently just plain rice with a little shredded cheese melted onto it . so , we finished our meal , all massively disappointed , and then it was another 10 minutes until we could get the check and then after that we had to flag down another hostess to actually pay the check because our waiter was mia . you might say it was because they were busy , but we did n't start eating until almost 8 and by the time we were done closer to 9 , the restaurant was at least half empty . the biggest disappointment for me is how many interesting sounding places i passed by walking to this place . unfortunately , my party wanted mexican and the hotel suggested this dump . i had one meal out on the town in scottsdale , on an expense account to boot , and i wasted it on this utterly forgettable hole in the wall disaster . in fact , i take that back . i will never forget frank and lupe 's . it goes on the wall of shame . learn from my error , fellow yelpers .
0	after seeing a google offer for miller 's , my mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood . so i offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good . once we were seated and greeted by our waitress , we presented the paperwork for our google offer . the waitress handed it to the hostess . i guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it 's legit . well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it . in the end she talked to someone and figured it out , but she made it seem like we did something wrong . or , she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there was n't much else going on for her to do . or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with . i later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - i guess they have several patrons who use those regularly . apparently with this kind of reception , no one wants to pay full price . mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese . the mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty . i ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork , not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich . we left with full and happy tummies . to comment on previous reviews .... yes , this is not the cleanest place . but i expected that and find it part of the charm . the smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room . overall , it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich . i 'd like to give it 3 stars at least , but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese could n't wash away .
1	vietnamese sandwiches : the only thing i go here for , to be honest this is the best vietnamese sandwiches in las vegas , trust me . not like lee 's sandwiches . hue thai bakes their bread fresh so when you get your sandwiches the breads soft and a little bit crunchy but still a little warm . i 've tried a couple places and this place has to be the best . other foods : they have a variety of vietnamese dishes , chinese , and even thai . but nothing taste super authentic . so that 's why i never order anything there except the vietnamese sandwiches and their boba ( which is decent ) . not a fan of their pho price : vietnamese sandwiches here are dirt cheap , $ 3.50 a sandwich i believe . only sucky thing is they require a minimum of $ 20 to charge a debit card . which you should know by now , i 'm a yelper who does n't like to carry cash . take out/eat there : to be honest dining there is n't so bad , other than the odd smell of cleaning products and food mixed together and the eye sore hallway to the bathroom the place is pretty alright . the design i guess is some kind of under the sea theme ? i have no idea why its under the sea that has nothing to do with vietnamese food . 4/5 stars for price/vietnamese sandwiches/ decent boba
1	it 's very hard to find decent chinese food in phoenix and this place is your standard fare . the house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll . they 're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but i do like how open it is . definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share . we could n't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs !
0	growing up in long island , ny ( and making frequent trips to brooklyn & manhattan ) i have to honestly say that as far as old time ice cream parlors go .... this leaves a lot to be desired . however , that 's not to say that this is n't a gem to be enjoyed . old town scottsdale on a sunday afternoon ( as i experienced it on vacation last week ) is quiet and hot . there was n't too much to do and the kids were getting restless . that being said , it was only 1pm and it was lunch time . the bright pink building can be seen from quite the distance and certainly stands out on the main road ( scottsdale rd ) in old town scottsdale . besides , any place that 's been around for 50+ years has merit with me . one piece of advice i 'd offer is keep it simple . a burger is an ok order , but stay away from the reuben . should be simple , but somehow ... outside of ny ... i rarely get one that 's worthy of the name . and this was no exception . big gripe : no fries ? ? ? they serve potato chips with all their sandwiches , no fries . do n't get me wrong i like their `` kettle chips '' ( which are n't made there , but instead probably poured from oversized bags in the back ) . but a true old time parlor should have french fries . ok , end of gripe . now to the ice cream . i wo n't comment on how they make it or give a review of all their flavors 'cause frankly i did n't have much . i had a coffee shake which was quite good actually . my mother-in-law got the '23 skiddoo '' that i was eyeing and she was quite happy with it ... it was dutch chocolate ice cream & turkish coffee ice cream , with coffee syrup , sliced almonds , whipped cream & a cherry . it looked great and got a thumbs up from mom . my wife ordered a mint chocolate chip sundae ( her favorite flavor ) and enjoyed it . the kids ... well , the kids are easy to please . just stick any ice cream in front of them with some cherries on top and they 're happy . overall it was a good stop and had fantastic , friendly service . the attached arcade left alot to be desired , but it seamed to me to be a cheap add on to a well established parlor .
0	we 're all clear that wanting to like something is not the same as liking it , right ? well , i want to love this place . it 's the closest non-take out chinese food place to my house so i was completely ready to make this `` my chinese restaurant '' . unfortunately it does n't quite live up to the hype . it is all good . it 's fine . some parts better than others . entrees are in the $ 8 range for chicken/beef dishes , in the $ 16 range for seafood and they offer a few specialty dishes up to the early $ 20 's . they have a decent section of vegetarian things as well , but less than you might expect at a chinese restaurant . there was more `` sweet '' in the sesame chicken than in the orange chicken - and they looked far too much like the same thing . the interior is kinda cool with funky lamps , window hangings and lots of bamboo . for a spot that size the bar , where you can also sit and eat , is a bit too big for me - but just because those 2 big screen tv 's are pointing out to the rest of the restaurant so we ca n't help but be reminded it 's there . the service ? not so bueno . i 've been there 3 times and once it was good , but not great . the other times have been pretty off each time . i read a great review about the place by a professional reviewer claiming that it was similar to san francisco chinese food fare . i 'm guessing he 's wrong , but i wanted to put it out here for other folks to see . http : //www.somonews.com/article.cfm ? articleid=242 i 'd love to hear what you bay area transplants have to say ...
0	dear kohl 's , i love you , i really do . i 'm brand-loyal to you since we were both born and raised in the glorious suburbs of milwaukee , wisconsin , however , my affection for you dwindled just a wee bit a few days ago after an unfavorable experience . ( sniff ! ) you got me with the $ 15 kohl 's cash along with the 20 % off coupon during your lovely annual thanksgiving sale . man , i went to town purchasing kitchen , bathroom , and small electronic necessities on kohls.com . after my shopping binge was said and done , i had earned a whopping $ 135 in kohl 's cash . score ! ..... then i went to town again purchasing a cookie sheet and luxury bed sheets for my condo . everything was fine and dandy as my shipments came in batches ( some much earlier than expected -- woohoo ! ) i made an error when purchasing the cookie sheet and bed sheets online and needed to return them . here 's where the heartache came : because $ 45 in kohl 's cash was used to purchase these items , i got almost nothing in return for them ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the moral of this story is that kohl 's cash is a use-it-or-lose-it situation . be very certain you are going to keep the items you purchase with kohl 's cash or else you are left with nothing . lessoned learned ...... i 'll be back .
1	i 'm a fan . i 've been here a few times and more often than not , all the food i get is pretty good , if not great ( at least for an ayce place ) . their ayce menu is fairly large . the dinner price is $ 26.95 and for kids it 's about $ 13 . most of the nigiri i 've tried was good , with standouts being the tuna , super white tuna , sea bream , yellowtail and eel . other items on their menu that i 'm a fan of include their gyoza , the yellowtail lover roll , and crispy rice with spicy tuna . their oysters and pork belly are decent and worth ordering again . i was n't a fan of the seared tuna in aj sauce or the hawaiian roll . the interior is cool with the long communal tables and benches . it also seems to be easier to get a seat than other ayce places around town . the times i went i 've never had to wait , which is perfect when my patience is running low , i 'm hungry , and all i want to do is stuff my face .
0	i saw their tv commercial for sirloin steak and all you can eat shrimp so i had to check it out . when i got there , at lunch time , it was so dark that i could n't even read the menu . when the waitress came over and asked me if she could bring me anything i said yes , a flashlight . i tried moving to several different tables where there was enough light to see the menu and finally gave up and left .
1	we had never had persian food before , just other mediterranean and some middle eastern food , which it seemed like this was a mix of those regional foods ? based on the yelp recommendations , we made sure to share our dish since it sounded like you get quite a bit of food . we got the chicken olivea salad , which is like a chicken/tuna/potato salad , really tasty with our pita bread . it had chicken , green beans , potatoes and lots of mayo , along with tomatoes and pickles on the side . we had leftovers , so i 'm making a sandwich out of it ! we also shared the sultani combo which had filet mignon and ground beef kebabs . they were both really tasty , and we especially liked the filet mignon . the combo came with batsmati rice and a tomato/cucumber/onion salsa type salad that came on the side . we had the persian ice cream for dessert since we read so much good stuff about it . it was really tasty considering it 's a fancy vanilla ice cream . the rose water and pistachios added a nice touch of flavor that was yummy there was one guy working , who was basically the host , waiter , and busboy , and he did an excellent job ! definitely will come back !
1	few weeks ago i was in vegas and was in need of a full makeup revival .. i went to three different make up centers and each place could not accommodate me , and when booking an appointment , they all required a $ 75 minimum . i went into nars and they were so nice and classy , they had me sit down and asked me a series of questions on my skin care , and preferences . i left with over $ 200 worth of product , i am so impressed with each item and give this establishment and it 's it 's staff the highest rating i can possibly leave , five stars all the way !
1	the little woody is the best little arcadia hideaway . you can only find it if you already know it 's there - they 've since added a red , glowing owl sign , but before that the only clue to this bar was the jameson barrel placed outside the back entrance . on the weekdays , it 's got a really relaxed , speak easy feel . it 's full of the young professional , after work crowd ( happy hour is every day from 4 to 6 ) . since it 's been getting more popular , the weekends are pretty crowded with a mixed bag of people . either way , this place is a fun time and full of activities . what activities , you say ? board games and jenga hidden inside the bench seats , two skeeball machines that spit out free drink tickets when you get a high score , and foosball and shuffleboard . every third wednesday they have speakeasy sessions of live acoustic with local artists . every month they have a skeeball tournament to win prizes ( like a growler full of beer ) . this place is great and you should definitely check it out .
1	the location is perfect , next doors to our dentist ... and i think their chicken is awesome ... the spicy honey mustard and asiago parmesan ... also must try .... their homemade asiago chips ... nice ! ! !
0	the food is okay . the portions are small . we went on a thuirsday for pizza and wings cause their wings are 45 cents . we ordered a small cheese pizza 24 wings and 2 drinks . their wings are so small i felt like i was eating popcorn chicken . we should of gone to our regular place barro 's where for the same price we get twice the size of the wings and an extra large pizza . and not to mention better tasting.no more native for me plus the hostess was busy chit chatting . why is it that all restaurants who hire 16 year old girls tend to have that issue .
0	i came here to celebrate with a friend after my last presentation for a class . this restaurant is pretty neat , however past experiences here has made me feel iffy here . this time around , it was n't so bad . i ordered the titanic with the french dip to dunk it in . last time it took forever for the food to come out , but this time it was around 10 min . the food was pretty fresh , and they have a lot of choices in sandwiches . take your time and read all the combinations . this restaurant is also neatly located right near campus , and their drinks are n't too bad . depending on what you 're trying to drink and what is for the special this place is n't bad . i had two coronas ( 2.95 on wednesdays ) so yeah , not bad .
1	wow ! ! the golden gate hotel is old , poor thing . it needs an overhaul big time ! i have n't stayed here & to be honest i probably would n't with the condition it is in right now . however , i did play here ....... oh yeah .... great little casino to play in when your trying to stretch your dollar and get the most action . we stumbled into this little gem when we were at binions and i asked one of the dealers where we could learn how to play roulette cheap . he told me that there was 25 cent roulette at the gg ! wow 25 cents , ca n't get cheaper than that ! the funny thing is that when we got there the roulette table was full so we all sat down and played blackjack . the minimums were about $ 5 for all table games which was a little disappointing since i was ready for my 25 cent games ..... hey i know that sounds cheap but i was trying to learn damn it ! ! i get intimidated by roulette & craps ....... too fast & people get all ticked when they sense you do n't know what the hell you are doing ! ! so the blackjack tables were fun & the dealers were nice & fun too ! and wow the waitresses were speedy .... always a plus ! so i did n't try the famous cocktail but i did go back the next night and won about $ 180 on the 25 cent wheel of fortune game , besides the fact that i was playing it for about 3 hours ! ! ! ! i 'm telling you i love these casinos where you feel like you are actually winning & that you have an edge over the house ! ! ! i will be back again gg .... thanks for the great times !
1	we were told to arrive early so we arrived before they opened . the outside of the restaurant is a little seedy but the inside is completely different with very efficient and friendly wait staff . the yellow curry was the best i 've ever had outside of thailand . the tom yum soup was divine . i wish we had this kind of thai food in the east coast !
0	jambalaya was very good . crab cakes so- so . not bad . not great .
1	si seor is the best mexican food chandler has to offer , from what i 've tried . the vegetarian combination is the best ! they offer quite a few combination platters to choose from , or you can get a plate of just your favorites . i bring all of my out-of-town visitors to this restaurant , pushing the sangria and combinations to all who dine with me . their horchata is also quite tasty , and it 's a nice compliment to the dishes with the red sauce . the sopapilla is a perfect ending , and i 'm happy to report that they also include them with take-out orders . very good value for your money !
1	panera is my `` go-to '' lunch spot . no matter what i 'm craving , sweets , bagels , smoothies , sandwiches , salad or soup it 's here .... perfect ! ! i 'm a total fan of the `` you pick 2 '' . i almost always get it when i visit and i leave full and happy . and how awesome is it that you can add a bakery treat for $ .99 ... whoo hoo ! so i was here a little after 2pm , there were a few people ahead of me but it did n't bother me since it gave me time to drool over the desserts , muffins , scones and cookies . my cashier was awesome , very funny and perky . she was a great employee to have and excellent customer service . i decided to keep in simple today , nothing new just one of my usuals the sierra turkey sandwich which has turkey breast , chipotle mayonnaise , field greens , red onions on asiago cheese focaccia and the greek salad which has romaine lettuce , tomatoes , feta cheese , peperoncini , red onions , olives , pepper and greek dressing . the asiago cheese focaccia is heavely ... i would eat this bread all day if i could ... it 's so freaking good . but i digress , the sandwich was great , i love the chipotle mayo mixed with the field greens and focaccia ... such a great combination of flavors . the salad was delicious too , i 'm really like the combination of the feta cheese , dressing and peperoncini and that crisp romaine lettuce .... mmmmm for dessert i picked the cinnamon roll ... o m g .... even though i was stuffed , i actually managed to have one bite after my lunch and it was yummy ! i 'm saving the rest for tomorrow morning with a cup of coffee ... mmmm i ca n't wait ! i 'm just such a huge fan of this place , i love the food and the combinations of flavors . i mean really , what is there not to love about panera ? ? ? seriously , delicious food ... good service at this place . will definitely go back !
1	i 've been going to movement restoration for two years now , and absolutely love it . i started going to trisha as a part of training for races ... then i just got addicted and go because i feel that her massages are good for the soul . through the work of movement restoration , i now understand what it means to say `` massage therapy '' ! i 've seen marjie in addition to trisha , and she is also fantastic . great people , great company . you ca n't go wrong .
0	it was my first time to eat here and thought it was a nice little pizza place . they cook the pizzas in a big ceramic open fire oven . i enjoyed the pepperoni pizza and the margarita pizza .
1	the actual facility and trip experience was incredible . however , the guide letting us in and our of our kayaks were sarcastic to the point of being rude . he joked that my friend was going to go under water if she did n't plug her nose , just by being pushed into the water and then upon exiting he told me to paddle as hard as i could into the dock to help him get momentum to lift me up . not knowing better i actually did this and got a serious jolt . what if i had had back problems or neck problems ? not cool . the water and scenery was beautiful and there was so much to do at the whole center . we did not let this one idiot ruin our day . it is a little pricey so you have to make the most of your day there and get there early , but it is so worth it .
0	i finally had five guys . we made 800 jokes on the way , after we ordered , i swore the cashier told us to enjoy some penis while we waited . excuse me ? oh . peanuts . of course , all burger joints have peanuts ? ! a bit bizarre , but they were tasty . we all ordered a burger to our liking and we shared cajun fries . my cheeseburger with grilled onions and jalapenos was good , it tasted like something you 'd make at home . the fries were terrible . not sure how they 've earned such recognition . i like crisp fries , these were flimsy and greasy , and i was n't a fan of cajun seasoning , either . overall , i stand by in-n-out .
0	first time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews . unfortunately , i wo n't be returning . the service was superb , no doubt . but the fried chicken was tasteless , sushi was ordinary at best . after more than $ 50 later , both my hubby and i ended up spending the night in the bathroom .
0	i normally like bww for beer and wings but this one is pretty terrible . the service is poor , upon arriving there was a wait , so the girl asked if we wanted inside or outside i asked what the waits were for each and she said 10 for inside and about 20 for outside . i put us down for inside so it would come up quicker , then several people came up behind us and were seated before us , on the patio . weird . so we are seated and we order beers and appetizers ( garlic mushrooms ) and the mushrooms came before the beer . and they were tiny . i tasted no mushrooms in the breading , and i 've had them before and they have n't been like that . by the time i got my beer i was so thirsty i drank it all before my wings came . then my mango habenero wings came , and no beer . so while waiting for my next beer my songs got cold . bad experience , bad meal , if we do ever go back to a bww it wo n't be this one .
1	went here with 3 friends for a night of tapas and sangria .... it did not disappoint ! everything we ordered was excellent and reasonably priced . i tried red and white sangria and enjoyed both , but i have to say i liked the red better ( probably just a personal preference . ) what makes this place special is that there is something for everyone from the carnivore to the vegetarian . i tried the anchovy dish cause a friend ordered it , and i was very pleasantly surprised . not fishy at all like i expected . my favorite dish i tried was the tuna peppers . i found that they used the a lot of the same ingredients in different dishes , so you could stick with one flavor profile , or you could totally mix it up . there 's a lot to choose from so i suggest that everyone at the table orders two dishes to start , then you take it from there . we saved room for dessert and ordered the sampler . i 'm glad we did , cause it had a little bit of everything . overall , its not a bad cab ride from the strip , and a great place to come with friends !
0	after reading all of the great reviews , i am really excited to go to this restaurant . we made a reservation because , online it said that they were recommended , but there were not many people in the place . we got the suggested appetizer of the tuna susci and it was delicious ! the waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and i could share . it was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned . my boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it -- it really was n't that great . it actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy , but he was a good sport and ate it all . i order the duck breast , and the duck was cooked perfectly . the only suggestion i have is that the duck was cut very thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze . it was good , but not over the top amazing . we were pretty full but ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert -- -omg amazing ! it definitely made up for the mediocre dinner . the service was really great , the dinner was blah , and the dessert was really good . i would recommend this place , but i would not come here again . there are too many other great restaurants in las vegas , this definitely has the atmosphere but i do not think our dinner was worth 150 $ .
1	i love the spiedini ! every bite was freakin ' awesome ! the italian fontina is not like any cheese i 've ever had before . combined with the prosciutto di parma takes this appetizer to another level . yummy ! i love the wiseguy ! grilled onions never tasted so good . the weirdest thing was the very last bite tasted the best . it 's like i 'm emotionally attached to that last bite and how it made me feel . yum ! ! ! i hate the sonny boy but i 'm not an olive person . every bite was overwhelming with an olive taste . yuck ! ! ! i could of done without the 2 and half hour wait though . since there is a wait , people get super drunk . when you 're sober and everyone around you is drunk , it can be a tad bit annoying and loud . the restaurant is super small . there is no room to really have an intimate experience when people are yelling in your ear . also , i could care less for the service . i guess when you 're not hurting for business you could act however you want . i totally do n't agree with that statement . i hope the staff reads these yelp reviews and improves the service . eventually , the bad service will outweigh the taste of the food . then people will stop coming . if i ever had the chance to come back , i would probably order takeout . the website said you could n't but i saw someone who did . it also said they validate , and they do but it does n't cover the whole parking fee . overall , i 'm still happy that i got to experience the best pizza for myself . it 's pretty cool to say i 've had pizzeria bianco . so i would suggest anyone to give it a try just expect the wait and the rudeness . hopefully , the food will make it all worth for you .
0	was here for a private room party . the food was great , drink was great , the service staff was cool . place was beautiful . why an `` eek ! me think not '' rating ? along with dessert i was the only one that night who ordered coffee , i wound up with minor food poisoning . most likely the milk was tainted . so if anyone is interested at this place i would say go for it but definitely avoid getting coffee .
0	in oct. my son that is at uncc had a nail in his tire . the person at tire kingdom told him he needed 3 new tires. , the car is dented and has over 151,000 miles on it.we told him to match the tread . instead of giving him options of prices they put on $ 184.00 tires eac on the vehicle . i called very upset the next morning and the manger said he would not give me an exchange nor would he give me any money off . he offered a 4th tire with a $ 70.00 rebate and would discount an oil change ! this is taking advantage of a young consumer and in my opinion a terrible way of doing business . i would never recommend this company .
0	this is really a 2.5. what lies between meh and a-ok ? ok. like the first matrix sequel . not bad . not good . just ok. typically i stay at the mirage when i vegas and so i try to slip into the cravings for breakfast . i would not say anything is gourmet or jaw dropping , but you can put together almost any breakfast you can imagine reasonably enough . unfortunately , the most disappointing aspect of the breakfast is the lame 80 's era hotel coffee . mirage -- you do n't have to serve starbucks . go to a local panera or einsteins bagels to get an idea of what you should be serving . something smooth with some flavor . not bland weak nothingness . you should be embarrassed at this point . i 've read other reviews that indicate this buffet used to rule las vegas . i 'm not really convinced any buffet can rule much of anything . i tried to over-rated wynn buffet and the far superior paris buffet and i 'm simply not sold on the idea that any buffet can challenge a reasonably good restaurant . but that 's not why buffets are in vegas . they are there to offer cheap fast eats . they are cafeterias with delusions of grandeur . the cravings is a decent 'cafeteria ' if you will . the sushi lacks fish , the shrimp is plump and bottomless , the coffee ( again ) sucks , and they 'll toss you a tasty salad of your dreams . like i said , it 's ok ... for a buffet . the mirage has been good about updating itself and i think it 's time my favorite affordable resort re-invent the buffet . scrap the silly name . pull the studio 54 gold and mirrors out of the interior . i 'm hearing good things about what the cosmopolitan is doing it . take what works and fix what does n't over there , bring it to the mirage . charge higher prices to people walkin ' in off the street but give resort guests a bold discount -- and name said discount as a benefit of the resort fee .
0	not really thrilled with this place . i expected more of an interesting beer selection . the food was good but nothing to rave about . our salads and entrees arrived back to back which i was not thrilled about . the inside was nice and the staff friendly . my husband and i agreed that it was not good enough to go back to .
1	thanks to yelp and the reviews i had a very nice haircut and a friendly conversation . traveling through an unfamiliar area and trying to find a good barber would 've been a bear . all the other reviews were absolutely accurate so i wo n't repeat . but the top was i got the haircut and hot towel at the senior rate of $ 14 . i am so happy that i signed up with yelp just to write this review .
0	the vig is part of the successful revitalization that has been happening on 16th street the last few years , and is now one of the hottest taverns in town . in a previous life , the building was a bank ; i love that they respected the integrity of this mid-century modern building by keeping a lot of the original structure - the outside bar used to be the drive-thru teller window ! they did a great job the overall design both inside and out - the atrium area is a wonderful place for large groups to gather . being a former bank , so be forewarned that there is n't much parking available - love the valet option ! i wish i was as enthusiastic about the food . generally speaking , although there is a variety of menu offerings , it 's all pretty much upscale bar food . it was good , no complaints , rather just average and nothing special or outstanding . the staff was friendly , and our waitress personable and attentive . the place is pretty noisy , though - so if you are looking for a place for a quiet conversation , this is n't it . will i go back ? sure but probably only for drinks . it may be over hyped , but it 's got a great atmosphere and great libations .
1	you are given an order sheet . you check off what you want and toppings on your burger etc . the staff is friendly . we came here because of groupon deal . it was a little hard to find since it was not on the main strip . they give you big portions for fries and my burger was good .
1	salsa bar alone is worth it . awesome artwork is worth it . best tacos/burritos are the cactus ones . not overpriced . we love this place .
1	this sushi place is great ! the rolls were fresh and very tasty ! ! we also received a complimentary appetizer and a sushi sample , which was a nice surprise ! customer service was great and the food was delicious . they do n't offer ayce , but the 4 rolls me and my friend shared were more than enough . i 'll make sure to come back here again !
1	hands down the best seafood place i 've been to in montreal , especially if you love freshly prepared seafood . think of this place as a seafood market . you order the fish / lobster / calamari etc by the pound , and you tell them how you want it to be cooked . you have an option of getting it fried , grilled or pan seared . the calamari is amazing , fried of course . so is the shrimp in garlic butter sauce . also ask for their hot sauce . it has a nice zing to it . for sides they have two kinds of rice , steamed veggies , dinner rolls , potato wedges and salad . did i mention its not too expensive ? no alcohol here . also they accept cash / debit , but no credit . food : great service : fast ambiance : casual worth the price : yes
0	thank you spirit airlines for being the airline that lacks compassion . my grandmother passed away before i could use my airline ticket that i purchased to say my goodbyes . in an attempt to modify my ticket to fly out for the funeral , i encountered rude and unhelpful operators . spirit airlines policy is to charge the consumer a $ 125 fee to cancel a reservation and receive zero credit from the original plane ticket purchased . the other option is to pay $ 125 to modify the ticket to another date , which is slightly reasonable . what was not reasonable was telling a mourning grandchild that they must immediately pick a date to modify their trip for a funeral . when i was disappointed to hear that they had no grievance policy , i informed them that i would need to call back since i was unsure of the funeral dates . the operator 's response was `` just to let you know ms. perez , when you call back our policies will not change . '' i work in a profession that allows our employees to do what is in the customer 's best interest . i am truly disappointed and disgusted with spirit airlines . i encourage everyone i know to never fly this airline . it is not worth the money saved flying a discount airline . going forward , we will always fly a more reputable airline no matter what the savings may be with spirit .
1	excellent food and service . love this place ! we had the enchiladas with steak the guacamole was yummy too . this is now my favorite mexican resturant ! ! !
1	ordered the sampler set ! 1oz of sample for 5 beers cost about $ 5 . much cheaper than most brew pub . there are 4 regular variety of beer + 1 seasonal brew . all the beer are good . the ales are smooth , with a hint of sweetness in the after taste . i did not order food here except chips and salsa , so i can not comment on the food/prices .
1	for starters the atmosphere of charlestons may be my favorite of any restaurant . its very dark and relaxing , but there is just enough light at the table to read the menu and eat your food . everything from the brick walls to the tables and chairs are made from dark wood , dark brick , dark leather , and even the wait staff wear all black with no logos , so its almost as if they are n't there and just blend into the background , which i 'm sure is an intentional and smart idea . the menu is small , but i have had various items on it from the steak sandwich , the ribs , chicken fried steak and the burger and they are all worthy of the 5 star . the sides are also delicious . its a bit pricey but you get plenty of high quality food for your dollar . if you want a nice , quiet , relaxing and delicious meal , i highly suggest charleston 's .
1	good start : the 32 '' dos x is $ 5.99 . fajitas $ 8.99 authentic looks , service and food , lovin it !
1	i love this place for the pickles they give you once you sit down at your table . okay & the food is good too ! been here twice , ordered breakfast types foods both times , & it definitely hit the spot . they are known for their pastrami sandwiches , which is something i 'll have to try next time i 'm there ! good service/quick as well no need for reservations
0	service was good , but that is all i can probably say about this place , because the food was n't . i ordered the tuscana sausage soup , the potatoes in it were n't cooked/boiled all the way , it was sort of too salty , but the sausage in there was pretty good . build your own pasta seemed like a good choice besides pizza , but i was wrong . i chose spaghetti , bologonese sauce ( meat sauce ) , meatballs and mushrooms for my pasta . it came out to around $ 22 - 24 for the pasta and those two added ingredients . while the spaghetti and sauce tasted fine , it was n't hot , it was semi warm , and everything else that came with it . the meat balls tasted like frozen meat balls from the market , it was also warm like the pasta . all in all , i did n't like the pasta , maybe i will opt for a slice of pizza instead .
0	drinks are overpriced but strong . service is friendly but mediocre and the food is okay but i 've had better . . overall not my favorite but if your a 20 something female you 'll prolly do okay . there 's a mechanical bull free for chick 's guys pay 5 bucks . i 'll just wait for saddle ranch chophouse to open .
0	i got myt first pair of orthotics with this place back in 2001. back then , i felt like a valued client , and they almost had me believe that they were foot specialists or podiatrists . i paid a little over $ 100 for two pairs . however , i visited the same location yesterday and explained that i could not find my inserts so i bought the shoes instead paying $ 600 for what i had purchased once a long time ago . yet the shoes were still $ 130.00 . i specifically asked for slip-resistant shoes and felt like being at a roller rink passing through the kitchen . i returned this morning , and the male attendant with a feux hawk decided to quote manufacturer 's words to me when i tried to return the shoes , or exchange them within 2 sentences of our conversation . so if it was n't for their overpriced and prescribed inserts not from someone who has a degree in sports medicine , it would be for the careless treatment i received that i am submitting a low but generous score to the only surviving location in clark county . i should add that female that i initially bought products from yesterday , was polite but said that their products would last 5 to 8 months at best , which is piss poor for $ 130.00 .
0	on 06/26/14 at 7:00am , i authorized ted weins to replace the transmission on my 1996 gold saturn . i was given an estimated completion of a couple of days for repairs . i called to check the status on 06/28/14 , as i had heard nothing from the shop . i was told that the part had just come in that day , and that it should be completed by 06/30/14 . on 06/30/14 i contacted the shop to find out what time the car would be ready , and was told it would be completed the next day on 7/1/14 by 5:00pm . i informed them i would be by the shop on 7/2/14 to pick up the car , as i had appointments all day on 7/1/14 . i arrived at the shop at about 3:30pm on 07/2/14 , and was told that again , the car was not ready . i was told there was a leak in one of the seals on the transmission , and to return at 5:00pm so that they could repair it . upon returning to the shop at 5:00pm , i was informed that the transmission was still leaking and more seals needed replacement , and the vehicle would not be ready until the next day . i asked to speak to the manager `` tj '' , and was informed he would be back at 5:30 so i could speak with him about the repeated delays . after waiting for 30 minutes to speak to tj , i was informed that he was gone for the day and was not going to be back until the following morning . i received a call this morning that again , the car will not be done , because apparently now they are having difficulty acquiring the seals they would be replacing . when i asked for the manager , i was told he was on vacation . no guess from them on when the car will be fixed . an absolute nightmare . do n't ever take your vehicle to this shop , unless you just want one heck of a snowball on your hands .
0	ordered the sicilian special . worst i ever ate . majority of pizza was tomato soaked dough . something tasted stale on the toppings . disgusting ! ! ! this place was actually recommended . lol what a joke !
1	i went to las vegas for my best friend 's bachelorette party and we surprised her with sin city cupcakes .. it was awesome ! ! ! she loved them ! ! ! the cupcakes were surprisingly good too ! we ordered the `` better than sex '' and `` pink pussycat '' , both were great . i wish they delivered to texas !
0	i 'm going to come out and say it , the buffet is n't all that . it 's certainly not worth it . at least not these days . maybe back when it was new and all that , but like fish sitting out , the moment it gets old it 's not worth eating and should be tossed out . so it 's really confusing as to why there 's so many people lining up to this thing daily . and while i 'm a huge fan of seafood , especially when you have it in vegas where they ship in thousands upon thousands of tons of fresh fish daily , you would expect to actually find something good here . what you end up with is just over hyped buffet food that is n't worth the lines you 're waiting in , nor the coin you 're dropping to get in . maybe it 's just that i 'm over the buffet scene . the younger me would have been all over this . in fact , i was . back in my early 20 's i would come here a lot when i came to vegas and stuff myself with all this seafood and feel incredibility sick for the rest of the day . but in the many years since i 've come to realize that while i 'm paying for quantity , the quality sure has suffered . and really , for the amount you 're paying to get in here , you 're just losing yourself in the moment of trying to make the plates add up to the amount . you 're better off just going to a nice sit down restaurant that is highly rated and has a specialty you like and enjoy the meal without feeling like you 're in the rush to make your dollar count . you 'll certainly bypass the awful lines to get in , as well as not deal with every tourist who was told they had to come to the bellagio buffet .
0	this review is only for the bar that 's located in the restaurant side . our bartender , david , was rude , looked bored , and did n't want to be bothered by people looking for drinks and food . he honestly looked like he hated his job ( and life ) . i can deal with shitty food , but shitty service pisses me off . apparently gilley 's is where washed up bartenders go to die .
0	walking into this place for the first time , i thought to myself : wow , this is nothing like the one in scottsdale . the restaurant was new and clean with good a/c . and the bar area looked like someplace i would actually want to hang out . later , thru more experience , i realized that there are actually a lot of similarities . same bad service , which ranges from snobby to forgetful and nonexistent . same mediocre boring bar food . same overpriced drinks . the only thing i really like about majerle 's is that they have good music and they show music videos on a couple of the tvs . that gives those of us who are not sports fanatics something to look at and also ups the overall coolness factor of the place . this location does have that as well but it is completely offset by the fact that there are usually a bunch of kids around . i know we are in the suburbs and close to the mall but when did it become ok to bring a baby to a bar . seriously ? i wish they would repeal the smoking ban just so that us dinks would have someplace to go where we could enjoy happy hour without screaming kids running around .
1	oh my god . seriously . the fried chicken is so light and crisp , i thought this dead bird was going to fly right off my plate . the collard greens -- you 'll want to slap someone for serving you greens that did n't taste like this . they are a gift from on high , and the black eyed peas are insanely good . redolent with pork and seasoning , they trump any black eyed pea you have ever had . cornbread is grilled and is n't the dry , crumbly , cakey crap some places have the gall to give you , and the macaroni and cheese is soupy , cheesy and perfectly cooked , just like you wanted . i saw plates literally overflowing with smothered pork chops and chicken , and if i had n't been full to the point of a coma after eating all the chicken and greens and mac and cheese i could hold , i would have ordered some . or catfish . or neck bones . desserts offered by one of the ladies who cooks walking through the dining room going `` who 's gon na have peach cobbler ? '' . who ? ? ? me ! that 's who ! peach cobbler ... are you kidding ? do people say no ? ? meals are one price , period , ( $ 10.18 with two sides and cornbread ) and you better bring cash . the lemonade was excellent ( $ 2.37 ) . oh my god , what would n't i have given to be a cow , with four stomachs . it 's worth going back to phoenix for . stop here before you drop off your rental car . you 'll thank me . so will your cardiologist .
1	very friendly service and nice atmosphere . they also allowed me to order the kid 's bean & cheese burrito , which was only $ 4 and very large ! it was also very good . hopefully i will be able to return in the future to try more of the menu .
1	i adore this place ! it is always packed and the service is wonderful . this is my 3rd visit in 2 months ; the portions are huge , the options are endless and the waitstaff is knowledgeable . my only advice is not to order any of the steak menu items . the sirloin was fatty and just bad ( one star subtraction ) . everything else i have had from sushi to chicken to shrimp has been off the charts delicious and fresh . grab a few friends , get the sushi boat and prepared to be blown away . a hidden gem that is in our regular rotation . check it out ! ! !
1	this place is the very definition of an ultra lounge . the place has enough room to make you feel unenclosed , yet is n't so big that you lose the person you were talking to when you go to get a drink for them . the bartenders are very easy on the eyes and are also friendly . this may not seem like anything out of the ordinary , until you visit other lounges . you 'll soon discover that in vegas , many ultra lounges employ ultra bitches . the only lackluster thing about lure is the patio area . it 's just an outside area with a fountain .... no view . disappointing in comparison to the outdoor area at tryst in the same hotel . like many clubs and bars in vegas , lure closes at 4am . ( that should be plenty of time to get your mack on ! ! ! )
0	came here for mother 's day ! it was packed but the wait was n't too bad and they had a band and drinks while you were waiting . we got calamari for the app . it was your typical calamari . my sister and i shared the sampler platter . it had tilipia , shrimp , and chicken with fries . we got full pretty fast , and it was really good . i do n't normally like seafood , but it was all fried and good . dessert we shared the turtle brownie ... it was a little dry and needed to be warmer . our server was really outgoing and funny . it was super busy so it took her awhile to get to us , but she was a good waitress . made us laugh quite a bit . i 'd like to go back on a calmer day to see if the quality was lacking because of the mother 's day rush .
0	nice people and good service , it 's just the food was subpar . if you love airplane food , you 'll love this place . if you like good subs , this is probably not the best place for you . another negative is the pricing - it seems to be way higher than subway , which has better subs than blimpie .
0	the staff is not friendly at all . when u ask them to toast the sub or to add toppings , u can see from there faces that they are burdened . i understand that i go early when they open , but that does n't give them the right to act like the way they do . the do n't really say hi at all , instead i end up saying how ur doing . if i had a choice to not to go to this branch , i would totally avoide this one .
0	mm .. it 's okay here ! ? just moving from one state to another and getting situated at home calls for a lot of take-out , so i figured ... now 's the time to really see what 's up with these places that are generally new to the area too ... ( sort of . ) so , i say .... their are better places for chinese take-out .
0	so i 've been to this location and the one in phoenix off ray and the 10. my friend has a membership here . so we 've been gym buddies and trying to encourage each other to go more often . sometimes u need that extra push to get you there ! if you want something super basic , nothing flashy or fancy then this is the gym for you . it 's about $ 10 a month , or you can do $ 20 a month for all locations and bring unlimited number of guests . now i 'm torn between a 2 star and 3 star rating for this place . first , i 've been a member with 24 hour for years . not switching , they 're pretty basic as well , nothing fancy , has everything i need for a very reasonably priced . however , my gym has a sauna , basketball court , classes , pool , etc . which planet does not . the big thing for me was no sauna ! what ! ? and what is up with that lunk alarm thing ? they 're supposed to be a judgment free gym supposedly , but then they have this alarm which screams and flashes when someone drops a heavy weight , grunts , or actually exerts effort . what the ! ! ? ? does n't really make sense to me . & is that really necessary ?
1	i was a bit worried about using sixt due to some the really brutal reviews here on yelp , but i have to say it was an excellent experience . i came into phoenix late on a wednesday night , and saw that the line was pretty long at the three small rental car places that share a booth . as i walked up though , the lines were for the other two places , not sixt . i walked up and was out the door in my car in about 10 minutes . the price was fair , about the same as all the other rental agencies . where sixt really wins is that they have some very fun cars for rent . for the same price as a chevy malibu at one of the other rental places , i was able to have my choice of a mercedes cla , or an audi a3 . i picked the cla , and had a shiny black mercedes with sunroof , for a long weekend . the car had about 2,000 miles on it and still had that new car smell . dropping off was easy , the whole experience could not have gone better , i will use them again .
1	this museum is located in downtown mesa . parking is right across the street which makes it very convenient ! parking is free which makes it even nicer : ) admission is $ 10.00 per adult or should i say anyone 12 and over . i believe this is a fair price for a museum . history is bountiful within the walls of this museum . the levels of history encompass everyone regardless of age . the kids ( young ones ) seem to enjoy the large dinosaurs that surround the rooms . there are several `` hands on '' areas for smaller children . teens have a lot to read about rocks , fossils , and history . i am sure you could spend hours walking around reading every last word , it does seem a little redundant and a lot to read . over all i think it 's a nice museum , i just do n't believe it is 5 stars worth !
0	no more than average serve and food quality with above average pricing . this is my second and last visit . they just ca n't pull off the fine dining restaurant concept .
0	had a coupon , as i usually do , and decided to get a monster taco . all i had to do was buy the drink and taco free ! ! cool ! i watched as a guy without rubber gloves handled my taco and its ingredients ! ! he put it in the bag and , there i go ! ! ! i asked the gal who was the cashier , '' do they not wear gloves when handling tacos ? '' she looked around at him then said , `` we wash our hands ! '' ok , no more ! ! too many other options .
0	the receptionist is rude . about a minute after i checked in another client came in and was offered water or coffee . seems like she picks and chooses who to be friendly to .
0	good stuff - trust me , go with the woody allen . it 's huge and filled with tasty pastrami and corned beef . relatively lean pastrami , and the horseradish mustard on the table is a great match . ( i made a kickass corned beef & pastrami hash with the leftovers today . ) yesterday i tried the cheese blintzes and a potato pancake . blintzes ... fried ? deep-fryer action ? very odd , but the filling was fantastic . the potato pancake was good , not too greasy , some noticeable onion action in there . but here is where they lose a star from me - $ 13 for three small blintzes . $ 5 for a decent-sized potato pancake . i think i was offended by the receipt which listed the potato pancake as `` latkes '' - as in multiple items . uh , no , you really did charge me $ 5 for one latke . service was also really slow . but this was the best deli dining i 've experienced east of the mississippi ( not including canter 's in la ) .
1	finally great thai food in arizona ! and in cave creek to boot ! best chicken pad thai i ever had . priced right as well . we will be back very soon .
0	i am giving this place only 2 stars because they charge $ 2 per item if you get take out . that 's a rip off . i got 2 entrees ( so $ 4 surcharge so far for that ) & wanted to get desserts too but did not because of the $ 2 surcharge per dessert . that 's crazy ! the food was decent . the place is a dive . reeks of cigarettes . i wo n't be going back .
0	been there a couple of times . the beer just is n't that great . i blame the water . as it taste terrible there too . the menu and beer parings are pretty clever on paper but the beer temps are inconsistent , mine was warm . the food is hit and miss and the place while a great old building it 's hot and humid inside . who wants to drink warm beer and eat dried out food in a hot and humid place in the summer in arizona . not me . but the place was packed ? ? ?
1	i know this is a grocery store , but i have to say i 'm such a fan of their food , that i usually just go here for a meal . i do n't know whose idea it was to surround the entrance with huge cases of pastels , galletas , and pan dulce , but it works on me every time . try to resist getting dessert first ( but do n't forget to save room ) . it 's a good idea to just put your blinders on for now and make a beeline to the aguas frescas - they 've got the best selection around . all are delicious , but my favorites have to be sandia , mel\u00f3n , or pi\u00f1a . ( btw - you can get a medium ( 20 oz ) for one dollar on wednesdays ! ) once you 've got your beverage , its time for the really difficult decision . the good news is that you ca n't make a bad choice , but that does n't make it any easier . the carne asada tacos , chile rellenos , and gorditas are great , but the torta is the best . try the carnitas torta - it is absolutely divine and ginormous . do n't forget to pick up a few roasted jalape\u00f1os at the salsa bar for a smokey , spicy kick . its one of those meals that you get and think there is no possible way you could finish it , but then you probably finish it anyway . you 're better off trying to save half for second lunch so you can get another treat on the way out , because you still have to head back through the pastry gauntlet for dessert . again , no bad options . the churros are fresh , the empanadas are amazing in any flavor , and the orejas dipped in chocolate are actually too big to finish on your own . that 's okay though , i 'm always up for the challenge . oh , and since this is a grocery store , enjoy a little shopping while you 're there . ( as long as you 're not in a hurry - everything takes a little longer at ranch market . ) i pretty much stick to the perimiter - fresh tortillas & chips , quesos , and the largest selection of salchichas i 've ever seen are a few highlights .
0	thought it sounded like a good idea ... not at all . limited menu and the chicken strips were all fried coating , very little meat . but the food in an airport is expected to be `` eh '' so that 's not why it 's one star . the service was awful . told to take a seat and he would bring a menu to me , never did . i waited for 15 minutes , all the while gesturing to the waiter to just get a head nod but no attention . gal finally came over and proceeded to take the guys orders next to me first even though they just arrived ( unfortunately this rating reflects the fact that these guys were just rude not inviting me to order first , even though it was clear i was waiting ) . coke delivered instead of diet coke and charged 2.50 for a small ramkin of bland coleslaw . bummer that this place is representing the new terminal . i would go to the little food court instead next time around .
0	let 's see , it 's loud . stupid loud . my server miss heard or fucked up my order horrendously . the server said she had worked there for six years . acted like a rookie . i had to flag some body down because they left us with no chips once the guacamole was made . then again to get the ice tea my friend ordered . i felt neglected . then he took our guacamole before we finished eating it . she told me that she would serve the mahi ahi tacos to a five year old . i agree . why beer batter a great fish like that ? it tasted frozen or pre-packaged . from a restaurant that is n't a chain i was sorely disappointed . let us be honest . the portions are great for skinny scottsdale courtesans , however like most terrible mexican places , i filled up on the chips . maybe i just had a bad night . when i return i expect better service . i want to be impressed by the food . till then , only two stars . the pros : pretty decor , nice salt wall , and bar is well stocked .
0	typical american fare . bland food doused with cheese , salt , and grease to provided flavor where there otherwise might be none . however , the prices were very reasonable and the portions were very large , so you will absolutely get your money 's worth . this type of food is not for those looking to be healthy , and coming here may remind of the obesity epidemic america faces . other than that , the place really does n't stand out in any way . there are some nice decorations hung up about the store you can purchase , but that 's about the only unique feature . in every sense , mediocre is the word that i 'd use to sum this place up .
0	if you like loud music and hearing even louder f-bombs being dropped then this is the place for you . food is okay but bar service is poor . pretty bad when you have to repeatedly ask for silverware and a drink . with all the other great places around , why waste your money here .
0	a farewell lunch for a coworker landed me here . i was n't impressed with the popover bread they serve prior to the meal , it had a strong egg taste that almost spoiled my appetite which is hard to do . thankfully , my mushroom and gruyere panini was very tasty and larger than i expected , with lots of fries on the side . everyone enjoyed their food and they also offer a small discount for bank employees which is a plus .
0	friendly staff , good atmosphere . inside or outside seating option is good . small portions sizes , high price , compared to most pizza establishments . taste is average . they ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there , so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer .
1	been going for 6 years and great pizza just like my previous home on long island . service and atmosphere stink .
0	gross . lo mein was incredibly salty , without much other flavor . egg rolls were soggy and disgusting . forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order . vegetable fried rice had peas , just . it should be called `` peas fried rice '' . oh , and it 's more expensive than average .
1	union pig & chicken has some of the best bbq that i 've found in pittsburgh . the brisket is soft and falls apart with a fork , although some of the pieces can be overly fatty . every time i 've been the service has been decent , but slow . union is also a surprsingly good place to go for lunch , the sandwiches they serve are delicious . one last note , definitely get the mac & cheese . it 's that good .
1	had a great time here and had nice service , we got a private room for our friends birthday and the service was really friendly and quick ... and i know my group could be a lot to handle at times too ... they did make the stipulation that we could have the private room for 15 ppl if most of the group did all u can eat ! !
0	first off a came in and the guy did n't acknowledge me , and when he thought it was a decent time to ask me if i needed help . i told him that i called for tires cause i had a flat then , the guy said wait a minute and helped a guy who just wanted air in his tire so i waited for them to finish and he said how can i help you again and i said i would like a tire , then he asked for my keys said have . i been here before then said you can sit down now . if i was n't form another city i would n't have come but i 'm in a tight situation so i had to bite the bullet . never again tho
0	i have n't tried many items or the lunch buffet yet , but from whatever i 've had here , i would say its a decent option for indian food . being a vegetarian , its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food .
1	this place is much bigger than i thought it was going to be . adults is $ 18 , a little bit on the pricey side , but i guess it costs a lot to maintain those expensive fishes , sharks , and the huge sea turtle . i do n't think i 'll come back , but definitely worth it to come here at least once . i thought it was pretty funny that there was someone guarding the piranha tank . i guess there are enough dumb people out there you got ta worry about sticking their fingers into the tank to see what the piranhas might do . hmm .. i wonder .. all in all , pretty nice place to bring the kids . it 's hot where they keep the reptiles so do n't bring a big coat to the aquarium .
0	this review is only for the food and drinks on the patio . the view is beautiful ! but the food and drinks were lame . i used to work here in the late 80 's and the kitchen was so filthy that i swore i would never eat there again ( food was good back then ) - i can tell you stories ! this past weekend we were at the renaissance festival and since my mom lives near the resort we thought we would give it a try on the way to her house . i do n't know if the kitchen is clean ( one would hope ) but the food quality is definitely poor .
0	i was expecting so much more out of this restaurant . when we first arrived i ordered an 'after school special ' and it was the worst drink i have ever had .. only took about 3 sips and it cost me about $ 9 . we were sitting at the bar for about 30 minutes waiting for a table and we never heard anything . so i went up to the hostess and they could n't even find us on the list and i had the pager . so , needless to say we finally were seated . our waiter was alright , not the best . but now for the food ... we ordered the pretzel and fondue which was decent but i did not see why there was so much hype for this appetizer . we also ordered the house chips and onion dip , chips were amazing and fresh and the dip was a little overboard . for my main dish i had the sweet corn cannelloni , and this was good but not the best thing i have ever had . i do n't know if i will ever go to the place again , but it is always nice to try something new .
0	do you need to show your cash/ credit cards at the door ? ? i dropped my boyfriend off to do some christmas shopping here while i ran to a nearby store to pick something up and then i 'd meet back with him to do more shopping at target . about 5 minutes after dropping him off he calls me saying he is being stalked throughout the store by target security . now my boyfriend is a very well dressed , very professional man and we came here about to spend a lot of money for christmas shopping so the idea of him being treated like a criminal made us both very upset . we only spent about $ 60 dollars and then left because we were so peeved about the whole situation . after getting home i spoke to one of my coworkers and she said she had the exact same situation the month before while shopping with her husband at this exact store . this makes me wonder if we now need show all our cash and credit cards to be given respect in this store .
0	good sports bar/restaurant -- if that 's your thing . went here when visiting with my dad who suggested it as `` one of those new fun places . '' the stuffed portabella mushroom appetizer was delicious , though ridiculously decadent . the carnitas libre pizza was also pretty good , but also extremely rich -- i.e . you can taste your arteries clogging . the pollotate pizza was bland and dry -- potatos on pizza is fun in theory , but i 'm not convinced . however , the cook forgot the onions on it , which actually might make a substantial , positive difference . we okayed the oversight ( they 've only been open for two months ) and they comped our bill a bit , so that was nice . the service was pretty great , actually . there 's a ton of tvs here and a well-stocked bar with loads of beers on tap . so if that 's your thing , it 's probably one of the better sports bar/restaurants out there . for me , if i 'm going to waste the kinds of calories that are packed into these dishes , it had better be for something extra special , which this place just is n't .
1	i 've been to a lot of gyms in scottsdale and bodi is definitely one of a kind . i have done both the strength and sweat workouts at bodi and they are truly the hardest workouts i have ever done . but in the same breath , modifications are given to make the workouts suitable for any fitness level . what really sets bodi apart from other gyms is the owner , nikki metzger . she is so incredibly welcoming , knowledgeable and passionate . it makes you feel comfortable in her gym and also very excited about reaching your fitness goals . i highly recommend bodi if you are looking for the best results from a 60-minute group fitness class .
0	avoid this place . the good was par for the course . we had a shwarma sandwich and bbq chicken . the chef flipped out on us about whether we wanted fries . the menu clearly says that all sandwiches are served with fries , but the cook thought differently . he actually came out from the kitchen , raised his voice , and asked us directly if we `` requested '' fries . it was very rude and abrasive . i will not be back .
0	i tried this place as it replaced the old red brick pizza that was there . the inside is pretty much the same as it was as red brick . the owner was nice and greeted us and said goodbye at the end . the televisions had a ratatouille disney dvd playing and when that finished they put on the old willy wonka and the chocolate factory . did n't care for the shows but i was n't there to watch television anyway . they were out of drink cup covers so i asked for some and the kid brings them out and takes his bare hands and grabs out two of them . i would have rather he have gloves and place them in the holder so i can grab my own without his touching them or at least would dig down into the center to avoid the ones he did touch . however , the pizza was n't good . as much as i like cheese on my four cheese pizza , there was too much cheese , soggy crust , and burnt edges . could barely get a slice apart and when i did manage to cut it apart and picked up a slice , the cheese just slide right off into the pan . i ended up with a pile of cheese and the pizza was n't tasty at all . my friend got a barbecue chicken pizza and it did n't taste like it as she used to get that at red brick just like i always got my four cheese . the red brick pizza was awesome and the cheese at least stayed on the slices . as much as i wanted to like this place since i hoped it was like the old red brick , this pizza was n't any good . we wo n't be going back there .
0	a store that specializes in cheese curds does n't have any ? well , they had bags of jalapeno cheese curds ( $ 5.99 and less ) , but regular cheese curds were non-existent . apparently , i need to return on thursday 's when cheese curd production is higher and they fill all their costco orders or some explanation similiar . there is a giant cheese/milk production facility right behind your store and you ca n't make some more curds or make some more cheese that makes more curds available . this is basically a waste of a store . it seems to serve as a sort of a circle k for the white coated and masked milk employees milling around at the corner of hardy and broadway . ended up buying $ 2 worth of jalapeno curds , but they could do alot more with this place than serve grab and go crap like a convenience store .
0	just like the club , tao beach is waayyyy overrated . sure , the girls get in for free , but the boys have to pay $ 20 . i have to admit that when i first came here , i was super excited ! the music that can be heard from outside the place was awesome ! if you like top 40 music mixed with electropop then this place provides . the thing is .. you seriously do n't need to be in this place to hear the great music . it can be heard from the regular venetian pool that 's right next to it bc it 's so freaking loud . plus you have more room to swim , let alone walk around , cuz tao beach is so dinky ! unless you have a cabana or whatever , this place is n't worth going to . my friends and i were seriously in and out . we got a cool bracelet though ! hahah . that 's really the only thing i would go there for- the novelty bracelet ( sad huh ? ahah ) . basically , everything 's the same for tao ( club ) . small , crowded , and stinkin ' overrated . sorry guys but usually first time noobies ( i.e . just turned 21 year olds ) hit this place up and will soon realize what a sucky place it is . on the plus side , there are hot naked girls in the tubs inside the club ! other than that , blah to everything tao .
0	went to baby kay 's on a friday evening . there was a 30 minute wait . we ordered some hushpuppies for an appetizer . my wife ordered a 1/2 oyster po-boy and gumbo and i orders the shrimp basket . the hushpuppies came out with a horseradish sauce and ketchup . the hushpuppies were ok , kind of like long john silver 's hushpuiies . the horseradish sause was excellent though . the service this night was not very good . we waited almost 1 1/2 hours to get our entrees . the server steered clear of us most of the night , which made us angrier . if she would have communicated and offered a salad or something to tide us over , we would have understood . we finally get our food and it is average at best . my wife 's po-boy and gumbo were cold . my shrimp basket had 8 measly shrimp on it . we were really hoping for better , especially after the wait . after our experience , we do n't know how this place gets such good reviews .. food and service not good .
0	food is ok , not great . i 've had way better .
1	this place is amazing ! ! ! the food id delicious and the atmosphere is just fun ! they have salsa nights on saturdays and the music is great ! definitely top 5 ! ! ! !
1	try not to view ironwood as an extension of the huge burton barr library and look at it for what it really is -- a small community library . it is a great resource for ahwatukee . it 's clean , has free wifi and plenty of popular items , and is a great place to get out of the heat during the summer for any number of people . since they 're part of the phoenix library system , they have access to great services like the overdrive catalog . go online and log in with your library card to check out audiobooks and ebooks ! you can check out 10 at a time . there are also plenty of great community programs like the culture passes mentioned in another review . the one downside is that the staff is pretty unhelpful ( and sometimes unfriendly ) . i 've had my daughter ask for a book because it was listed as being on the shelf but it was n't in its place . i do n't need a staff member to walk over to the shelf , look at the empty spot , and then shrug , saying it must be lost . i could discern that myself . some of the ladies working behind the counter ( i do n't know what their function is ) are downright unfriendly and sullen . retire and let some newer blood in , if you hate your job that much . ignore the staff and you 'll be golden .
1	bangkok 9 is my place to go for lettuce wraps . those little chicken filled leafs are awesome . i 've tried to replicate them at home . they came out good but not as good as those at bangkok 9. i think it is the sauce that i struggled with the most because i do n't know what it is or what is in it . i tried to make a citrus and soy sauce . it was not even close to the real thing . the lesson i learned from this ( drum roll please ) for the real thing , just go to the restaurant . they have good food . the service is hit and miss at times . there is a young woman working there who speaks perfect english and is attentive . the older gentleman speaks with broken english and does not always come around to refill drinks . i do n't much care about that , though . as long as the food is good . and the food has always been good the times that i have dropped by . the one time i was the slightest bit disappointed was when i ordered the masarman curry . it had a great flavor . i love my meat and potatoes . what turned me off were the peanuts . a good portion of them were burnt with a bitter taste . whatever . this is an easy place to miss if you do not know where to look . i had driven by it a few times before i finally spotted it . it is next to the pier 1 imports store in the walmart shopping center right on cheyenne and rainbow .
0	terrible customer service- did not answer their phone when i called for the status of my truck . i was quoted one price and charged more . never called when my vehicle was done- would not recommend this place to anyone ! ! !
0	i 'm not that happy with it . i 've been checking everyday in the hopes that i will find something new , but it 's the same shows again and again . i 'm beginnning to regret having subscribed to them with the fact that they just do n't care about getting more shows . how the heck does this kind of business survive ? not only that , but their website interface sucks ! it 's not user-friendly , and it 's so dark ! that should 've given me a warning at the beginning . there goes my money .
1	i ca n't remember too much about my initial reaction when i stayed here . i 'm writing this review 5 months later so my memory is a bit fuzy . go figure . my stay was comfortable and convenient since it is connected to xs ( my fav ) ! the decor was very plain in comparison to my favorite hotel , the venetian . other than that , i 'd recommend giving this place a try . room service is amazing ! i had a salmon and veggie dish while my friends ordered a veggie pizza and lobster mac and cheese . everything was mouth watering and flavorful !
1	best place in vegas ! al was a big help , made it so convenient . it was at a great price and got it the next day ! i wont go anywhere else for my banners ! this is the place to go ! great prices great quality and no shipping cost !
1	the decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good ( and fresh ) . i 've gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet . both good for the price - it 's inexpensive .
0	i really should give this more stars , but here 's why i leave it at three . 1. not a female staff member in the house ( yeah , yeah , i know ) - but sometimes it 's nice to have a table with a view . 2. i mistakenly ordered the 'end cut ' of a prime rib . some places have great spices on their end cuts - this is not one of those places . i should have gone for the medium rare like my buddy did as it looked pretty good . 3. it was nice a decent setting . you really did n't feel like you were in the casino . quiet , good , but not super great . do n't read this as though i ripping on the place . my pants were probably too tight ( as they are now ) which might have made me grumpy ... give it a whirl .
0	we had dinner here this past saturday . the food was outstanding . if you 're into greek food and especially seafood , you will not be disappointed . we have been to greece twice , so we have a pretty good sense for what the real thing should taste like , and this place amazing in terms of the food . the grilled octopus appetizer was to die for . however , the service was painfully slow , hence only the 3 stars . our waiter 's excuse that he was dealing with a larger party was pretty lame , considering the $ 240 bill for two ( no dessert , and only 2 glasses of wine ) . it took 2 hours to get our food . we were so tired of sitting and waiting that we skipped the dessert . beware of the market price of the daily fish . ours was $ 98 , for two , which they do n't tell you up front , so you might want to ask in advance . also , the wine pours were a bit skimpy for the $ 16 per glass price .
1	very very good chain family restaurant . i had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great . service was excellent and the party of 5 i was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse . it 's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close .
0	holy spinach ! so , my partner and i ordered the vegetarian version of their philly cheesesteaks . it was slimy spinach , a little onion , a little pepper , a little cheese , covered ( slathered , soaked , drenched ) in oil and vinegar . i did n't request oil or vinegar , and it was n't an option presented to me online when i ordered . and the spinach ... oh , my , gawd . i grew up on a farm in southeastern ohio and i 've never seen so much spinach crammed into such a small place . seriously - there are other vegetables . lots of other vegetables . their onion rings , though , are pure art . they are the most delicious onion rings i 've ever put anywhere near my mouth , with the exception of oak creek in sedona and sun up in phoenix .
1	went to grand lux cafe for breakfast . pretty good . service was great . i had the eggs benedict , was large so i only ate half . my son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious . the hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that i have no complaints . my waitress even made me some coffee to go ! overpriced , but all hotel restaurants in vegas are .
1	still a star nails fan , and receiving the same good service . some of the nail technicians are more experienced and perform better work ; overall good value for the price .
0	unlimited pickles have arrived at jason 's . the solo , lonely pickle on the plate has been abolished and now all sandwich ordering patrons can load up on pickles at the salad bar . they are decent pickles with a good crunch . just imagine if every sandwich you ate in your lifetime came with unlimited pickles , how many per sandwich would you eat ? i downed 7 of them with my $ 6.99 papa joe . the sandwich was turkey with roma tomato and pesto aioli and was good , despite being small as it was shoved onto a square of herb foccica bread about toilet paper size . there are places with better turkey around , so unless you love pickles , this chain will only be necessary when in a bind . salad bar is good too on a previous visit , but just throw some chicken or protein on the thing and stop nicle and diming us for everything up there ( pickles was just a start ) .
1	my friends and i are at this place almost religiously . so much that we have come to recognize all the regular hosts , wait staff , bussers , and cashiers . we even have given many of them nicknames . i have yet to try this place in the daytime because the late night specials is where it 's at . i can personally vouch for every item on the late night menu . my personal favorites are the steggs ( steak and eggs ) and the biscuits and gravy . if you 're looking for a place to recover after a night out drinking with some solid food , this is it . service may not always be the greatest depending on who your server is and how busy it gets , but it 's hard to complain for the price you pay .
0	i can not believe this place exists ! how is it competitive in charlotte ? the flavors are absurdly overdone : super salty , super sweet , and conflicting in that they pair savory with super sweet and drown it all out . i may have an answer : the place is filled with the elderly . maybe it 's `` the walking dead '' tongues . seriously , the youngest person there was in their early 50 's . it 's like a `` speak-easy '' for the rich elderly ... it just keeps afloat by a secret handshake that acknowledges you are in a terrible place but you can be old there without the riff-raff . also , it is terribly expensive for the low quality they are putting on the plate . even the drinks are super sweet . avoid at all costs !
0	you have to be kidding me . possibly the worst food in vegas . the only thing fresh was the salad and the horseradish . brisket=leather tough . chicken= bla . dessert was sad .
0	when a place is called philly 's and on the menu is has `` the original philly '' i assumed they would know how to make a good philly cheesesteak ... boy was i wrong ... i 've never had a cheesesteak were the meat was pretty much ground meat ... was not very good at all ... they do get points for using cheezwiz .. maybe next time i 'll just stick with wings ... cause i 'll definitely go back for the outside seating and good drink prices ..
1	i 've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and i finally found out at my visit to scramble . i ordered up the garlic spinach , thyme & mushroom brizza ( which also comes with some type of cheese , possibly provolone ) . this thing was delish ! my girl ordered up the ham & cheddar brizza , but she liked mine even more and proceeded to steal one of my slices . scramble also scores extra points with me for having loose-leaf teas . i got a cup of the gun-powder green tea mint , which was very good . we were bummed that the hashbrowns were pre-made with bacon inside , as it made them no option for vegetarians like me . we sat outside at their very slick & shaded outdoor patio and dining area . cmon down , ya got ta try a breakfast pizza !
1	ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to high-end designer brands . the cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons . they also have their own coupons and frequent sales , so you can get good deals here .
1	i 've been wanting to visit this place for some time . always pass by it and finally did today and it was sooo worth it . i know these mexican food places are hit & miss in the north valley . there salsa bar was great . the hot salsa is very flavorful impressive . i knew this place would if been pretty good when i saw a grandma in the back cooking . i had two tacos rice a beans . there tacos were shredded beef tacos and the beef was pretty good and the rice was true mexican rice . the beans were a little salty but still pretty good stuff the cashier guy was supper friendly and the restaurant was very clean and authentic for being in a strip mall . go check it out ! i 'm picky about my mexican food and this place was pretty good . i like to see them around long term so go visit !
0	i hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard . but , my mi rancho was not that good . authentic ( i never had cactus before ) , but the beef , advertised as steak , was very tough . the mole enchiladas , a specialty too , was n't great either . i will go back to give them another chance , but with so many mexican options they wo n't get a third try . sorry .
0	for $ 30 a person this buffet is n't worth it . the items that are being served here do n't stand out . usual pasta , pizza , prime rib , crab legs , salads , etc . the food was n't horrible but definitely not worth $ 30 . the desserts were ok , but as usual there 's was nothing that would make me come back . you 're honestly better off spending the $ 30 per person and going to a nearby restaurant within the casino . 5/10 ( overpriced )
1	we had a delightful early dinner on saturday at tina 's ! the food was fantastic and we loved the laid back family atmostphere . my daughter was with a friend and i and even she loved the food . we spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture ! we all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere ! thanks tina !
0	the most hostile people i have ever met . horrible in every respect , i am surprised people pay for the abuse they deliver . my experience with xs was hands down the worst i have ever had with any venue , ever . they ruined my birthday , embarrassed me , and i believe potentially charged me for it . stay away from this place ! ! ! ! !
1	good place to watch the game tonight , it 's monday night football ! food was yummy , portions were good as well . good drink specials , and the free blueberry bacardi sample was yummy too . ride a mechanical bull if you want : ) i had the cheeseburger with potato salad , tasty .
0	how do i give less than one star ? not sure . if you are asian and know taiwanese or chinese food , this is not the place to go . service is horrible and the owner of the place has an attitude . our food was n't serve timely . the main dishes came , finished , then appetizer still did n't show up . drinks are horrible . beef noodle soup was the worst i 've had . just do n't come
1	we 've been here a few times with our boys and on our own . with or without our children the stay was enjoyable ! the property is clean & beautifully located on lake las vegas . it really gives you a sense of being away with the convenience of being 20 minutes out of town ! they have a fantastic family pool area , a beach entrance area on the lake and a upper pool area if you 're staying without the kids ! the restaurants are a bit limited if you want to stay at the hotel the entire time , especially when we had our children with us . it 's perfect for a `` staycation '' , but if they want to attract someone other than locals they should try to provide some sort of evening entertainment . a saturday night dj or a lakeside band would be ideal because once you 've spent the day in the sun & eaten your supper there 's really nothing left to do .
0	terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes , but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes . after i went to another mechanic to discover the problem , fletchers still would n't fix the problem .
0	i love cheyenne west & i have taking my pets for years ! i love all the doctors & assistants they are all great & treat my babies excellent ! the receptionist ( s ) need to work on their people skills though , the past few times i have been there i have not been greeted they do not speak to me first , not even to pay my bill
0	shitty experience ok there busy that 's ok , ordered food very specifically and it came out wrong , crawfish was good and blue claws were good . wanted to order more food and was given the check instead . went to the counter to pay manager gave me a thumbs up like everything ok said no wanted to order more food and was given a check . still hungry ... left beyond dissatisfied , and hungry .
0	this is a pretty small location , although that is to be expected since it is inside the golden nugget . there is an outdoor patio so you can enjoy your coffee while people watching on fremont street . the line can get long , but the staff is really nice and work fast . i got my coffee really fast despite how busy it was . the reason i had to take off a few stars is that they do not take the starbucks card and do not give starbucks rewards members any of the benefits . this was the only starbucks i went to in las vegas that did that and the others i had gone to were in casinos as well . i can understand not wanting to be part of starbucks rewards , but i do n't see how hard it would be to take starbucks cards since they already accept credit and debit cards . i could have gotten coffee somewhere else , but i made the effort to go here just because it was a starbucks so i was disappointed that i could n't pay with my starbucks card .
1	this is the best bbq and pulled pork i have had since virginia ! i was told it was good but could not fathom it until the first bite , then the second and third .......... the flavor carried over to all of their meats served and everything else at the buffet was worth the 20 minute lunch wait . i got the buffet not because i actually eat enough to get a lot of food but so i could try a little of everything . too bad only open for lunch but in today 's economy that tells you something if they can make it only serving lunch . not greasy as some have tried to say - i can not stand greasy food and it 's a bbq joint of course the meats got sauce ........ now go ! ! ! !
0	would give this place a higher rating if the service was n't so spotty . the food is great , came here for restaurant week and got a great deal , an appetizer , two curries and dessert with two chai 's for $ 30.00 we went ahead and bought two bottles of wine just for fun too . i 've been in here before and there is a very sweet server who makes recommendations and brings out the food . the weird part was that this time , we barely saw her and instead were basically ignored by all wait staff ( two other folks ) . we had to ask for the restaurant week menu ( which they had hidden ) , they then proceeded to forget to bring out the chais and hustled us out of there until we reminded them that it was supposed to come with dessert . service snafu 's aside , the food is really good and hard to argue with . all the great standards are here and if they pick up a bit on the service ( it got to the point that we had all the plates stacked up to make a visual cue , but they still left the plates there as we ate dessert ) the restaurant would be a regular outing for me .
1	another great addition to downtown ! ! ! i love that they use the same kind of tortillas you would find in mexico . interesting history in this church . i love how they kept a lot of the original church in the remodel . at this moment i am eating their salsa which is perfect . spicy but not like you ate the sun . the tacos are mexico meets urban . super creative . i 'll be back for sure !
1	i normally hold off on writing reviews for chain places but i met up with some girlfriends for lunch on a sunday that wanted to hear about my trip and they said let 's do lunch at claim jumpers , so off i went . we were seated right away by the manager , who was very friendly & nice and our server for the meal was vanessa , and let me tell you vanessa loves her job she was superb job , she is what inspired me to write this review . from the start of the meal to the end of the meal she was present thoughtful and helpful even offered us some tea to go when we left . i was in the mood for a salad so i went with bbq chicken salad it was perfectly prepared but it visually it looked amazing , the greens , the red of the tomato so vivid in color , and the best part it tasted great too ! i can honestly say that i have n't been to a claim jumpers in a few years and i am happy that i did that sunday afternoon ! great company , great food , excellent service .
0	i stopped in here purely for the sake of convenience . my usual go-to tailor is off flamingo and my go-to shoe repair guy is off eastern , but park avenue cleaners is a lot closer to my house . so one day on the way home i decided to bring a dress that needed the zipper repaired and a pair of shoes that needed new heels put on . it was clear that the guy behind the counter ( maybe the owner ? ) watched me from the moment i parked ( in front of the store ) and walked inside . he completely , obviously attempted to up-charge me probably because of the following : 1 ) i arrived in a bmw , 2 ) my dress was herve leger and he commented on the brand and 3 ) my shoes were christian louboutin , which he also commented on the brand . i did not need them re-soled , which is what he tried to sell me , i just needed the little rubber heels replaced , from wear . we went back and forth and he tried to charge me nearly $ 50 . out of control ! he wanted $ 18 just for the rubber heel replacement , when my go-to shoe repair guy ( b & l shoe repair off eastern ave. ) charges $ 10 flat , regardless of what brand the shoes are . i said thanks but no thanks and walked out .
1	i like to think i 'm a good local , but i never knew of this place until the travelzoo offer came . a wonderful brunch spot right in downtown phoenix ( inside westin hotel ) . the decor is lovely and the service is on point , but the menu is also quite interesting . my favorite part is that they brew intelligentsia coffee ( a chicago favorite ) . one criticism : if the menu states 'roasted red peppers ' i do not expect yellow , which are not as tasty . overall , great experience i will repeat .
1	i decided to try the bikram yoga studio in phoenix and i have to say i am very happy with it . this location is very conveniently located in uptown plaza next to aj 's . right off the light rail too . i 've been going for about a month now . my first class was with mj who i think is awesome ! in fact all the instructors i 've had , while all different , are pretty good in their own way . they are great about keeping to the dialog and explaining the postures , and their benefits . they make sure to keep you reaching for more and i have noticed a major improvement in myself . the studio is a good size but i will say i would prefer more studio space and less lobby space since the classes can be pretty large at times . it 's not a deal breaker by any means . i think the cleanliness is pretty good . i know past reviews have said it 's not which makes me think they may have done something to improve because i do n't feel it 's bad at all . but this is a bikram studio , so not sure what people are expecting . people are sweating non stop all day in there . for that alone , it 's amazing how clean it is . i like that they supply a cleaner & towels to clean your mat after class . this is handy and probably helps them make sure the class will have clean mats attending . the men 's locker room ( which is all i can review ) is actually very nice . it 's clean , a good size and it has nice cubes for your belongings . if i had one compliant it would n't really be about the studio itself , but more about some of the new people attending . i wish they would give the new students upon signing up , a run down of bikram etiquette . i have heard far too many people chatting in the studio before the instructor comes in . many students use the time before class to quietly meditate and center themselves as they prepare for class . with groupons coming out , there tend to be a lot of `` first timers '' so it 's important they know the etiquette before they enter the room . also leaving the room should be for emergencies only . we are all dizzy and want to vomit , get past it ! once a girl walked into class well into our second set of breathing exercises . that was a little shocking since in most studios that is a huge no no ! when the class starts if you are late ... no class for you . it 's a great feeling and i am glad i have found something i really enjoy doing . i am always looking forward to my next class !
0	my friends and i got wristbands for free entries to rok . i must say that i love the music that they are playing . i like the layout of the club and you can watch music videos of songs that they are playing on giant screens all over the club . so three stars for that . minus two stars for the ridiculous drink prices . i can understand that my vodka 7 is $ 11 because this is vegas and all mixed drinks in vegas are overpriced . oh they do n't even have 7 up , they serve sierra mist .. yuckkk . then my friend just got the sierra mist without any alcohol in it and we got charged $ 6 ! ! ! ! yes , $ 6 for a glass of soda ! highway robbery to the max .
0	buffalo wild wings always always always has great food no matter how busy or what time . the only problem i have with this location is that the servers are always rude and some of the management is n't so nice either . last time my boyfriend & i went in the waitress did n't even pay attention to us and barely took care of us . then after a manager came up to us she was rude , annoying and was speaking to me like i was stupid . once again i love the food but i 'm over their stupid customer service .
1	i will keep this short and simple . service - awesome . everyone , and i mean everyone , is so nice and attentive ! dining area- we requested to be seated in the wooden weavy basket area . love the layout . this is a nice place if you wanted to do a business dinner ! ( we were just a party of two though ) appetizer- dungeness crab cocktail . okay . i am spoiled by seattle 's seafood so i have high expectations . yes . the crab is good . cold and refreshing . however for $ 25 dollars i rather have tried something else as i can get much more up north . however it was good . steak- bone in filet was their signature so that 's the one we chose . i think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted . medium rare . it was tender and it was good , but not melt in your mouth fantastic . it was overshadowed by ( dun dun dun ) the fish ! ! ! seafood- chilean sea bass . i got it the `` arreganato '' way . i probably butchered the word too . holy crap this was amazing . it melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more . sides : thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi . omg this is soooo good . the truffle oil just perfected it . best gnocchi ever ! ! lobster mashed potatoes was a huge portion ( had to take it to go ! ) i am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides . didnt have room for dessert but we really wanted to try the butter cake . lame . next time ! overall a good experience but expect to cough up some serious $ $ $ . try the fish ! ! !
0	i do n't have much to say about this hotel because i would n't stay here again . hotel rooms-i stayed in the back tower and the walk to the tower was horrible . walking through an entire casino with your luggage is the biggest pain in the ass , not to mention walking the bridge across the pool to get to the tower . big thumbs down . room was really nice , decor was nice , beds comfy , but bathroom was a motel 6 bathroom . very old looking . not what i would expect if owned by a hilton chain . casino-casino was actually nice and fresh . because it was newly renovated it smelled clean and did n't smell like a shit hole like some of the older casinos . lots of options . accommodations-pool was awesome , staff is nice , house keeping staff nice , but check in was a nightmare . checked in at 2pm and line stretched to the casino . i was in the hilton honors check in and that line was in the casino as well . if it takes 30 mins for checkin , then you have already lost me as a customer that will not stay there again .
1	great atmosphere , friendly welcoming service and most important the food it is delicious ! ! ! i highly recommend it , specially if you are like me , from out of town . great experience ! ! !
1	amazing ! i called the day before and there were a few different times available for the following day . i set up a 2pm appt and then the day of i had to run errands . so i called around 930am to see if i could drop my baby off earlier . they said i could bring her in anytime i wanted . i dropped her off around 10 and she was so excited to be getting all the attention from the staff . they called me around 3pm to let me know she was ready . i picked her up around 430 and she was all clean and fresh and pampered . the groomer told me she had her nails clipped , ears and eyes cleaned , a blueberry facial , and a bath . she looked adorable in her little periwinkle colored satin bow . i went to pay and was shocked at how cheap it was for everything . only 35.00 ! i will definately be back !
0	i personally love boba , but i 'm very picky when it comes to the perfect consistency . i 've been to places that serve boba that 's too hard , other places serve boba that 's too soft . haha . now i sound like goldilocks . i guess i just did n't realize how difficult it is to cook boba . apparently , it is n't as easy as i thought . lollicup is one of the few places that serves perfectly cooked boba and the drink flavors are good as well . my favorite flavor is the taro milk tea . i would n't say theirs is the best i 've had , but their passion iced tea with mango jelly is pretty darn amazing . that drink will keep me coming back for more .
0	ok so i usually get my car washed for free at the dealer but was short on time and decided to give this place a whirl . the entrance is a bit strange and when you first arrive its not very clear where you need to go to get the ticket written up , anyways found that . i decided on the 19.99 deal and with my 3 dollar yelp discount paid 16.99. first thing you notice is this place appears to have a lot of employees running around , what they are all doing is a mystery to me since the reason i came in was to get my car washed and that was done poorly , i can only assume they are all running around stocking shelves , i mean this place is almost like a mini market , they are selling way more then just car washes here , which is really detracting from the quality of the wash itself . part of my 19.99 ( 16.99 ) wash was scented air , to my surprise when i went in they handed me a scented tree to hang on my rear view mirror , wtf ? this is n't 1982 and i do n't drive an old beater , all the car washes i have ever been to that offer this is a package item actually spray the scent in the car , not give you some cheesy tree to hang in the car , i tossed that shit away . when my car came out it sat out in the hot sun for at least 7-8 minutes , not under the shade which all the other cars were under , i was going to say something and then i noticed the person who was going to do my car , i told him as i usually do to the people who work on my car , i want special attention given to the wheels and tire dressing and pointed out a few trouble areas that i wanted him to address , he said no problem , i gave him the 5 bucks and when i started to drive out they had bent my side view mirrors in and when i popped them back out they were filthy , the windows were filthy the car was horrible , i was in a rush so i didnt have time to have him do it all again , i just will not return . i get better washes when they are free at the dealer . this place needs to focus on what kind of business they want to be and hire people who will reflect that vision , not slackers with no sense or sight . i would never reccomend this place to anyone unless they like to pay to have a half ass job done .
0	should be 3 $ . 10oz filet $ 48 . presentation looked good , sauce on the ribs and chicken was a little thick , salads were very good and so was the bread .
1	i went here today for lunch needing time away from work so i drove to sakana i walked in , the place was very busy right off the bat i was greeted with a big hello and smile ...... thank you i had the savanna lunch special 9.99 which included miso soup a nice salad 6 or so pieces of fish 6 pieces of rolls and a smoked salmon tempura roll thing very good and plenty of food
1	sooooo much food ! their portions are giant . giant does n't necessarily mean great but it 's pretty good bbq if you ask me . their bbq sauce is n't overly sweet but rather , a bit tangy which i am now a fan of . i got the half chicken and two sides and it could have fed two people easily . it lacks a star because of how freezing this restaurant was and the fact that the portions were just ridiculously huge . scale it back and turn up the temp .
0	i like monty 's food -- breakfast , lunch , and dinner are all very good -- but i just ca n't help thinking that it 's overpriced when i go there . it seems like it should be diner-priced . . . but almost $ 9 for a grilled cheese seems a bit steep to me . their desserts are to die for , though .
0	went through the drive thru tonight and didnt receive any of my sides . upon returning to the drive thru the girls told me they prolly did give them to me , but she would give me more anyway . first i ordered 17 dollars worth of food . why would i want to get some free mashed potatoes and cole slaw . second i made it all the way home and wasted my gas to get the order correct . way to call your customers liars . never going back again !
0	this place has really gone downhill in the last decade compared to what else is out there . the hotel hallways and rooms are no different than your typical holiday inn on an interstate in the middle of nowhere in the u.s. casino is in good shape but when you stroll through bellagio , wynn , venetian , etc . it 's just not the same here . even the walkway to paris lets you know how `` dated '' bally 's is . only plus is the pool is decent and maybe the sbarro breakfast downstairs is fast .
1	joe makes the best friggin burgers hands down ! the rest of the menu is very inventive and plenty of options that are non burger related . brian the head waiter is awesome and a pleasure to see . the beer is always ice cold and the shakes are delicious ! $ 5 burger mondays are insane !
1	this place has really good halal kohbedays . however they close pretty early and are not even open on sunday 's . there hours are m-s 11-9 .
0	lets start with the positive i loved the orange ruglah . i had a pastrami sandwich and i love good pastrami . if you like overly salty oversmoked meats this might be a place you 'll love . i love to smoke things . i have two smokers in my backyard and even from time to time make my own pastrami . i have been to katz 's deli in new york and seek out good authentic pastrami . stalzy 's is unique they heavily smoke their own meats and i think they are a bit over the top on their pastrami . now i live smoked food but it has to compliment the food not be tie end all be all quality that comes out ( other than salt in this case ) that said there is enough praise for this place here to make me want to try some of the other neat things looking on their menu so i may revisit my rating at a later date and will stop again
0	i was the first time came to las vegas , i was so hugely when i arrived this resturant , i feel bad when i arrived , bad service , late food and bad food , i do n't want to came again .
0	i went to this location for a dinner with my girlfriend and her parents for the father 's day celebrations . this location is pretty busy , so i would highly recommend that you reserve a table ahead of time , otherwise you might end up waiting for 30 minutes . after we were seated , the waiter came over to take the order . i ordered the steak and crab cake , with asparagus and mashed potatoes . my gf and her parents ordered salmon and sea bass . while we were waiting for our dinner we got their complimentary bread with olive oil and pesto dip . it was a great pseudo appetizer to meal that we were about to have . approximately , 20 minutes later the dinner arrived . the steak and crab cake came with a lobster bisque sauce . the steak was good , however it was n't perfect , it was n't seasoned enough and the crab with lobster bisque sauce was bit to salty . asparagus looked like it was heavily drenched in steroids ; this thing had bigger muscles than me ( got to love genetically modified vegetables ) . i tried my gf 's salmon and it was pretty good . seasoned properly with delicious lemon butter sauce . overall ( 3/5 ) , good for chain restaurant , but you can do way better when it comes to seafood at other locations in lv .
1	good service ! i had the usual soup , salad and breadsticks .
1	i love me some cracked egg i 'll tell you what . coffee cake alone is enough reason to come here . it 's light , fluffy , warm , steamy , sweet , and they 're constantly updating the flavors like a pumpkin one in the fall or the berry one i had last . my favorite things to order for an entree are the scrambles , particularly the south shore with chicken and avocado . their corned beef hash is scrumptious and tasty as well . tried soup and salad also , portions are huge . great place to brunch .
0	my wife and i brought our animals here for over 10 years , even after moving to stallings , we would still drive all that way . recently after our oldest rescue passed away , we decided to find a new vet mostly because we had noticed that ever since becoming a `` vca '' animal hospital , the prices have sky-rocketed , and the service has dropped significantly . when i say the prices are ridiculous , they are literally double for most basic procedures that you can get done at any vet office . if the prices are going to be that high , i would expect the service to match what i am paying , and that is certainly not the case . we always felt pressured into very high priced procedures , that when we turned down because of price , were snubbed off and looked down upon by the dr and/or tech . that does not stand true for everyone working in the office , but the great majority . i can truly say i believe this office cares more about money than they do about any living being , animal or human . to top it off , and this is what pushed me to finally write this review , is a few days ago i got an advertisement for dog teeth care in the mail from vca . on the front page in big bold letters is `` you ca n't get dentures for peanut '' peanut being the name of my deceased dog , who passed more than a month ago ! ! ! as i am sure most dog owners can relate , they become a part of our family , and after 13 years , a part of you . with the passing still raw in the family with my wife and daughter , seeing our dead dogs name , being used in an advertisement , without our permission was disgusting . the response from stoney creek ? ? ? sorry that was sent from our corporate office in california , must have been done before our records updated . i do n't want your excuse of corporate sending something , when we started coming here there was no `` corporate '' in california . all vca cares about , yes they are known to me now as just vca , the stoney creek we went to does not exist anymore , is the money . find a consistent vet , one who knows your animals , and is not trying to rip your wallet out of your pocket the entire visit .
0	yikes , what a service nightmare . i took my bike here for a scheduled oil change and to have a flat tire fixed . what resulted was the age old rape the customer for every penny add as little value for as much money as possible snafu you 'd expect from some mechanic stranded in the middle of the desert a la billy bob thornton 's character in the movie u turn . the tire ended up being the tube only , $ 150 , okay i can live with that at the harley shop . the synthetic oil change $ 130 , same deal . i decided to go ahead with the 20k service as well , which was $ 385 and negated the oil change cost , so i was around $ 560 after tax with those services . painful yes , but again , expected due to the market cornering logo harley davidson being attached . but here 's where things went awry . i received a voicemail from ari in the service department the next day , as i avoided the call hoping to check my messages and simply be told the bike was done and ready for pickup , but something made leary of answering . i checked my voicemail to find ari had left a message detailing all the great things they had done to my bike which we had never discussed and they made the executive decision to `` fix '' like changing my amber colored light bulbs to red and removing he smoked out lens covers , so as to allegedly keep me with the law . they also changed the bolt which fastened down the leather strip accessory on my back fender , as they claimed it had been digging in to my back tire when i hit bumps . ok , great . if the things you changed on my bike without consulting me helped me to stay compliant , and prolonged the life of my tire , great . but then ari , ever the salesman , err customer service rep , informed me my tail lights were no longer working and it would only be an additional $ 185 for parts and labor to get them fixed . to wit , i responded , my taillights were working when i dropped the bike off yesterday , and they 've quit working under your care , i 'm not paying for you to correct the problem you created while making changes to my bike we never discussed . ari , oh ari , said he would talk to his manger and came back with a response that he was given permission to waive the labor cost if i paid the $ 105 part cost to fix the taillights . i reiterated my position about the lights working when i dropped it off , and somehow the price went from $ 560 to $ 585 and i agreed to do it versus leaving with nonworking taillights . during the conversation , ari stated harley davidson gets enough jobs that they do not need to drum up extra business by creating new problems . i told him i thought that was strange he felt to address or state that when i never accused them of doing such . basically if you have to create and state an alibi to something that has n't been accused , it seems suspicious . beyond the taillight debacle , ari stated all bikes getting serviced in he hd service dept get a custom something or other power wash , so i expected to get my bike back gleaming at the very least . after coming to an agreement about the taillights , ari tells me `` i 'd like to give it a bath if you have time . '' i 'm thinking , ya that 's part of what i paid for . so i waited another half hour for my bike , long enough to be approached by a sales lady who informed me they 'd give me a whole $ 3k as trade in on my aped out , customized 2008 nightster if i wanted to buy the $ 19k fat boy lo i was admiring . when ari finally brings my bike around it looks like the time i washed it in the dark after a 12 pack , like ray charles washed it . i told him it was a shitty wash job , and he responded we did n't do that , we could buff it out if you want . not even sure what he was talking about , but basically , ever the salesman , deny all plausability or accountability , like the taillights that quit working under their watch , and try to gloss over the subject . totally disappointing experience . they have a sign up on the lot next door about their upcoming new facility coming soon . apparently they 're trying to expedite their move by upcharing and upselling their customers while providing as little service as possible .
1	cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio . food and service was great both at lunch and dinner . i highly recommend saving room for dessert . i would have given it 5 stars but i just was n't a fan of their cocktails .
0	first , they should 've changed the name when they moved to the chandler location . it 's not the same fun-loving old west town that it use to be . very few employees in character , there is no spontaneous wild west action because all shows are scheduled and cost , the shops are modernized , and there is little to see and do . the sweet shop has delicious fudge and chocolates but has lost all of it 's old west charm and has given into commercialized brands . there really is no consideration given to capturing and maintaining the old west rawhide . we went to the blue collar beerfest & backyard bbq , which in itself was a disgrace to the beer and bbq world . ( one bbq food truck and i will spare you the tacky beer details ) there was no country music , grunge rock bands played . even in the saloon they were playing top rock hits ! while i love rock music , it was not befitting to the supposed theme of rawhide . there were even timeshare vendors and massage chair kiosks set-up in the town ! we ate in the steak house since the bbq selection was minimal and the line was extremely long , about 40 plus . my fiance had to return his `` smoked '' chicken because it was very mushy . there was no hint of smoke to the chicken , it was in the sauce . he did enjoy the sides though . the salad and rolls reminded me of cafeteria food . yucky ... however , my prime rib was as good as i remember it though and the waiter was great . i was happy to see some of the artifacts from the old brought here to the new location , like the bar and saloon entrance . we will not return . i do not want my memories of the wonderful old west rawhide ruined .
0	i stayed here for 4 days august 11 , 2014 . 1. we got to check in 4 hours early . 2. we got a $ 15 food credit . 3. the location is awesome downtown . 4. the rooms were average . 5. there was a water main break that flooded and dampened at least 6 floors by the soda machines in the hall . they put fans out which did n't really seem to help . it smelled like mildew and forget walking around without tennis shoes . 6. i tried to get a drink out of a soda machine late at night when i woke up thirsty . i seriously tried 10 floors before one took my dollar and ate it . i walked all the way to the opposite side of the casino to tell the front desk and they told me to walk all the way back upstairs at 3am to get my id . 7. they had a brand new ultimate texas holdem table . i was their very first customer ever on the game . i had to ague with 2 pit bosses and a dealer that i still get paid on the play if the dealer does n't qualify . i was right come to find out . it pissed me off that they were trying to act like they knew when i know for a fact they were wrong . 8. not enough outlets in the room . you really have to search . 9. beds were very comfortable , blanket was soft , and the ac was epic . 10. i do n't think i would stay here again because i want to experience other hotels and this one just did not go the distance for me to give it another chance with the other options out there .
1	i really enjoyed this place , but first let 's get ther boo 's out of the way . i made reservations about two weeks in advance because i wanted to be sure i got the time slot i wanted . i made reservations for 7:30 , we arrived there at 7:15. the hostess said we would be seated closer to 7:30 and that was fine . so we sat in the bar ... and sat ... and sat some more . it was almost 8 till we were finally seated . i saw people walk in get seated shortly after but not us and it was just a party of four . finally get seated then ordered more drinks .. that took awhile ... ordered an appetizer and that took awhile .... then the soup comes out and that takes awhile ... finally our entrees did n't come out till 9:14 .. ( i was checking my watch then ) so we did n't leave the restaurant till 10 ... i thinking they were really lacking waiters . if the hostess seated us at the time i made reservations then it would n't have been so bad . but eating so late leaves awfuly bloated . ok ok , now the good part . this is one of the best seafood restaurants i 've been to in arizona . it 's fresh and delicious . i did n't have the salad bar , but it looked really really good . they have a good wine list and the apps are good too . we were way too stuffed to try the lava cake , but there 's always next time . just make reservations an hour earlier , ha !
1	definitely one of the finest properties in las vegas . the location is outstanding with great access to the strip , mccarran , the highways and tons of other vegas locales . the building and facilities are immaculate . the valets , concierge & security team are the ultimate professionals . we bought a unit as a vacation home in 2011 and its tranquil , safe and a fun place to getaway to .
0	as a beginning rock climber , i do n't have much to compare it to . i thought it was a fun experience that i would definitely do again . the equipment was durable and safe and after watching a demonstration video , they personally showed you how to use it appropriately . however , as soon as i walked in the door , i was n't impressed with the unwelcoming staff . all 4 of the employees that i interacted with were not very personable . as a new climber , i appreciated any support and help if i was doing something wrong . instead of handling the situation in a way that expressed support , they made you feel like an idiot . while i would probably go back because it 's close to my house and i enjoyed rock climbing , i 'd rather drive a further distance for friendlier people that want to encourage you .
1	great selection . for the selection of poke- all around $ 10/lb . i tried the ahi hawaiian and the ahi wasabi- delicious . it 's a clean , friendly , family owned deli/market style set-up . i work less than a mile away once/week which is great , but the only problem is they close by 6pm . : ( they also own a new restaurant in that same plaza `` 808 hawaiian '' . i definitely will be trying that next .
0	this theater is so dang busy . i understand it is in the middle of town square and all , but it has a vibe to it that makes me feel unwelcome . it really is n't for locals unless absolutely convenient or necessary . the seats are nice and the prices are high . except for the $ 5 tues movies .
1	love their tacos . service is fast and friendly . place is clean .. bathrooms clean . need to be better at keeping the guacamole made so people do n't have to wait .
1	if there was ever a cheezy moment in my life , it was here . i was coming back on deployment from the middle east on rr . and i wanted to renew our wedding vows that we made a couple years earlier . the staff was friendly .... we went through the drive through and did it through the window .... then got out of the car and started taking all these cheesy photos .... i think they knew exactly what we wanted .... it was awesome ..
0	it was a 2 hour wait , so we have to walk around and come back . they get your number to send you a message when your table is ready which was cool . their service : there service was great , the hostess tried to talk to us a little bit and asked if it was our first time , and thank us for waiting , and ask where we are from and all that , our server was great too , he came to check up on us here and there . the appetizer : we had the pork belly bun , it did n't look great but the taste was good . the burger : i had the duck/bacon burger which i think was okay . my bf had the big hot dog , i forgot what it was called but i have a picture of it . i did n't finish my burger , i only had half of it and took the rest home , if it was that good i would of finish the whole thing and not leave any left over . overall i did n't think it was what i expected maybe i had a higher expectation because it was one of gordon ramsay restaurant , but i would n't mind coming back to try other food because maybe the ones i tried did n't make me satisfied .
1	i recently purchased a new desktop computer and was having some problems with getting my messages sent out in outlook on both computer and ipad . in speaking with technical support and andrew , he walked me through the entire process and all is well . we have cox for our telephone , tv and internet and are very happy with the service . thank you . jane and john lynch
1	this place never disappoints . i have never had a bad meal here . there are always plenty of vegetarian selections to choose from . i recommend making a reservation as they are always busy !
1	the burgers are very good . i 've had the bbq before & just had the i love bacon burger ( brisket & bacon yum ! ) tater tots are a must & love the beer specials . 32 oz . sam adams for $ 10 & you get to keep the cup : ) all i have to say is i love i love burgers !
0	quite frankly ... the alliante station might be the worst hotel in las vegas when it comes to finding a decent meal . with the exception of mrkt , the other outlets have no concept of fresh well prepared food . tonite i tried cabo ... del taco has a better chance of getting me back ... cheap ingredients prepared poorly with no attention to detail is not a combination for success .
0	not a fan . i visited here 4 times over a year ago . thought the food was mediocre at best . the atmosphere was cool and the service ok. not interested in returning . have lots of other options . the atmosphere is unique and cool , but not enough to return .
0	about as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate . bland , plain and tasteless . the only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread . avoid .
0	i really want to love this place so badly . i moved into the cheery lynn historic neighborhood about three years ago and have watched several places fail . i 've hoped somebody would buy this cute little place and make it into something great . so , my husband , son and i went yesterday with high hopes and hungry bellies . we 've been looking forward to trying it since we got a menu on the door the other day . i hope as they move into their new space , they update the decor and get rid of some of the previous owners ' decor . such a big part of going out to eat , is the ambiance . the building is so cute and there 's so much potential for it , but what the original two hippies owner did was just plain awful . as far as the food goes , i am unfortunately sad to report that it was just not that good . my first `` beef '' is the beef . i originally posted that i had thought they used frozen patties , but received the nicest reply stating that they do get their meat locally and it is never frozen . perhaps we just came on a bad day . i ordered the loco moco and i had to cut my hamburger patty with a knife and fork . i was also excited to try the homemade macaroni salad , but again ... not so good . it was more of a mayonnaise-macaroni soup . way to runny for my taste . but that 's just me . my husband got a burger and it was okay . the best thing we got was my son 's hot dog . it was just a plain hot dog with ketchup but it was pretty tasty . i 'm thinking that when i go back ( and i definitely will so i can give them another chance and i can support my neighborhood joint ) , i 'm going to get one of those hot dogs . they have all sorts of exciting options for hot dogs including homemade chili ( my favorite ) . they do have really delicious strawberry lemonade and tropical iced tea . i feel bad writing anything bad because i 'd really like to see the new owners succeed . they were exceptionally friendly and welcoming . they responded to my original post and were very , very sweet so i know once they work out all of their kinks , they will do well .
1	postino is amazing ! ! monday and tuesday nights are the best time , and only time , i really ever go there but their bruschetta deal is fabulous ! ! you get any bottle of wine plus a huge bruschetta plate for $ 20 ! ! ca n't beat that ! ! and if you want to go for another bottle of wine , just get another bruschetta board to go ! love to sit and dine on the patio with good friends and good wine : )
0	i 've been to this office several times in the last year and strongly agree with joan c. 's review . the hygienist pushes extra dental work and cleanings . i got the deep-cleaning 2 months ago and my gums feel worse than before . i `` saw '' the dentist once -- she peeked in , looked at my x-rays and told me i needed fillings . she barely smiled or made eye contact . i 've been at the front desk when she 's walked by and she did n't even acknowledge me . i am now looking for a new dentist .
0	surprisingly good . the charburger was tasty , their fries are above average and the price is very fair .
0	went here last night for the first time last night ... took forever to get in , then another customer decided to get into a fight with us because they did n't want us parked next to them , it was hard to hear parts of our movie because we could hear the movie that was playing next to us , and the helicopters flying around were really distracting . but the prices were very reasonable for admissions and if you wanted condensations ( plus we had coupons )
0	due to the lack of pizza places in the area , we 've gone there on a number of occasions . i think we 're finally done for good . the pizza just is n't very good . very dry and tasteless crust and a little sparse on the toppings . another thing we didnt like was no matter what night we would go , there was always some sort of live music going on . it 's not that i do n't like music but the acoustics are so bad in this place , it makes everyone too loud and hard to listen too . carrying on a conversation is impossible . because of that , we always would sit in a small side room where , unfortunately , the service was below par . there 's always a lot of cars there so it 's obviously popular , but honestly , i just do n't get it .
1	very friendly people who work here . they were so great with my kids ! definitely will be back .
0	working close by , i thought to give a try this italian place today . being a member of the gourmet society club i made the call for a booking at 13:00 mentioning my membership and the happy lady on the phone made a note of our reservation . when we arrived at 13:10 , the place was almost packed . it took them around 5 minutes to show some attention to us and take us to our table , which was n't 100 % clean ( breadcrumbs , signs of pepper stuck on the wooden surface ) . we never felt welcome - there was n't even a smile , some courtesy , not even a simple apology when two salads and a calamari starter took roughly 25 mins to arrive . when we asked for the bill and mentioned the gourmet society card , the abrupt mature waiter said that it ca n't be used during lunch time , with me adding that when i made the phone booking , i was n't informed of that term . the waiter turned with a silent strict look to the lady behind the bar that was speechless ( and must have taken the reservation ) , and after thinking about it for a few seconds , he finally said ok. food wise , my goat 's cheese salad was ok , but i think iceberg lettuce is not the best choice for it . my friend was n't that happy with her caesar salad ( tasteless lettuce ) , and she even said that the crouton felt plain . walking out we saw two ladies looking desperately towards the inner of the restaurant waiting to be served soon , but that might take a while , i think . obviously , we are not going back ...
1	fab music and great drinks selection . some people so cool it looked like it hurt but overall friendly and lively . pain that the loos are all the way downstairs and not the best for 5 inch heels ! !
1	after trying this place last night , i 'm having a lot of trouble declaring whether i prefer burger bar or blt or even lbs ! so many awesome burgers in this town make this a difficult decision ! burger bar ( or lbs ) win out if you like the make your own burger thing . these places have a much better selection of toppings ( my 2 favorites - brie cheese and cinnamon bacon were missing at blt ! ) . however , i do love blt for the sheer variety of `` pre-designed '' burgers . lamb burgers ? ban-mi burgers ? crazy i tell you . i had the kobe slider trio cooked medium rare - 1 was bbq , 1 was blt and 1 was blue cheese . all rocked ! the sweet potato fries were superb - better than burger bar 's rendition . we were all way too stuffed to try the shakes , but they did sound awesome .
0	a couple of my friends really enjoy this place , but no matter how much i try , i just ca n't warm-up to the place . they do have a decent tap selection , which includes a nice mix of local micros and tasty macros . not in the mood for a tap ? check out the large selection of bottled brews . their beer menu is excellent because it lists the style , the origin ( city/state/country ) , and abv . pricing is a bit higher than you 'll find at most of the locally-run pubs . the food and service is where i have to take away a star or two ... the food i 've tried has been greasy - from the chicken tenders to the pizza rolls to the regular pizza - it 's all been terribly greasy . it tastes hyper-processed - i think another reviewer made note of this , and i could n't agree more ... and , it 's overpriced - count on spending around $ 22- $ 24 for dinner , a drink , and a soda/tea . service is ( wait for it ) spotty . i 've been to this location five or six times , and have only once had a really good server - we sat in the bar , and our server was excellent . he never let a glass go beyond 2/3 empty . sitting in the dining area has resulted in less than favorable service , even when the place was n't busy . so ... old chicago ... i 'm sorry , but i have to give you a `` meh '' rating . food = 2 stars ( greasy ; seems sub-par ) service = 2 stars ( very spotty ; sit in the bar for best service ) value = 2 stars ( pricey ) misc = 3 stars ( good beer selection ) with places like roman candle , rosatti 's , glass nickel , buck 's , and others very nearby , i ca n't justify hitting old chicago . sorry .
0	not very good . my friends and i were hungry , and we mistakenly chose the first place we could find . all five of us felt like our burgers were dry , when we ordered medium , and that the buns tasted borderline stale . we all left unsatisfied .
0	i really like the food a lot and eaten or carried out food for the past few years . the reason i only give two stars is because hey constantly screw up my carry out order . i had a stretch of like two months in which there was something incorrect in every carry out both at must have been a record of sorts . tonight , once had my order messed up i ordered two burritos with no cheese . guess what ? there was cheese , cheese and more cheese . how is it possible that a small restaurant can screw up so frequently . i have no idea .
1	good , fresh , tasty , abundant , good value . say , `` hi '' , to micky .
0	after another amazing meal at monta ramen , the gf and i decided to hit snowflake given the positive reviews from a slew of yelpers . well , dang it , sad to say , we walked away bewildered at our disappointment in our first ( and likely last ) visit to sfs . in fact , it bothered me ( which has never happened before ) that our experience differed so much from others - was it simply a bad day for sfs ? i doubt it since several people eating in the shop were clearly pleased with what they were eating . also , while watching the guy prepare our snow , i can actually see the pride in the product . did we order the wrong items - i went with the cookie mix and the gf went with a strawberry cheesecake mix . the strawberry was ok but for the most part , we had the same opinion of both - we reminded us of our youth eating ice milk - i ( we ) did n't like it when we were kids , and we do n't like it now ( not to say that sfs served us ice milk - maybe it is - heck if i know ) is `` snow '' an acquired taste ? or maybe the taste buds are finally shot ! not sure , but when it 's all said and done , we did n't like it ! heck , now i 'm afraid to try the raku dessert place - will i be disappointed in that , too ?
1	great authentic irish pub not a chain just a real irish pub , great food , music and people . this is a sure thing to bring out of town guests , family and to celebrate your life . great memories here for sure .
1	we started off here , by going to maui dog , which was closed due to an 8am burglary . then we tried to keep the hawaiian theme , and decided to go to ono hawaiian grill . but upon walking into ono and being overwhelmed by a sewage smell , we quickly turned around and walked in to on the grill . i went with the chicken and apple sausage ( which was a nice find because so few places will carry this ) . the sausage was tasty , and the condiments ( lettuce , tomato , relish , etc .. ) all seemed to be fresh and presented nicely . the fries were good as well . nothing over the top here , just pretty good food . no complaints from me . the staff was very friendly , and jovial . i will go back if i 'm ever in the neghborhood .
1	my new favorite thai restaurant ! ! bangkok has delicious made-to-order thai food . the tom yum soup is not to be missed . i was n't a fan of curry but once i learned thai curry is much different than indian curry i decided to try it . now i am hooked on the panang curry .... mmmm . every dish can be ordered to your desired curry-hotness . next time i 'll try the tom yum fried rice.there are so many dishes to choose from , i suggest bringing others with you so you may try many at the same time . the service was great , the restaurant clean . if it 's not busy do n't let that fool you . that can change in a minute . i noticed they did receive many take-out calls while i was there . whoever said the west side restaurants were all chain restaurants needs to eat here !
0	hit & miss . today was a miss . eggs and bacon both under cooked . pecan pie was runny and glopy .
1	i do n't even know where to start . a hotel of this caliber in miami would cost triple what we paid for our two unforgettable nights at the m. the decor is sleek , sexy and innovative . a sensual , floral fragrance permeates throughout every inch of the hotel . there 's free soda fountains on the casino floor and a very reasonably priced buffet that seems so go on forever . when you book your room , you either have a choice of strip view or mountain view . while the mountain view sounded lovely , i 'm really glad we chose the strip view . we watched the sun go down as las vegas came alive and then fall asleep in the comfortable loungers by the floor-to-ceiling window as the city lights shimmered behind a transparent veil of rising desert heat . our room was very modern but extremely cozy and inviting . the bathroom was enormous . i probably left claw marks on the porcelain from having to be dragged out of the bathtub . there is a goddamn tv in the bathroom mirror . i repeat . tv in the mirror . you can watch first 48 while you 're dropping a deuce . also , holy free shit everyday . we got a bottle of wine , a polo shirt , a windbreaker , a t shirt , and an apron ! you better believe i was drunk off my ass , prancing around my room in that thing . here are my only gripes : - there was only one area to get ice on our floor and it happened to be at the opposite end of the hallway . kind of a mission since i was using one of the two sinks as coolers for the bottles of champagne and vodka i brought with me . - spa mio offers a $ 50 bikini wax and they mean `` bikini '' for real . none of their staff is apparently trained to do a proper brazilian so i basically paid $ 50 for about a third of the hair removal that i get at home for half the price . that being said , the girl that waxed me was really lovely . the wax she used was top-notch . i barely felt a thing . the spa itself is so relaxing and serene . i probably would 've paid $ 50 just to sit in the waiting area and continue getting drunk . - i 'm really not psyched about the totally unnecessary $ 200 hold they placed on my credit card . turns out the guy that checked us in did n't have to do that but did anyway , assuming we would use the internet and the mini bar . who the fuck does that and if you already have my credit card info on file , would n't it make more sense to deduct whatever expenses we incur after we check out ? fuck . i could 've used those $ 200 which i wo n't see again for another 7-10 business days . thanks guy . other than the points mentioned above , i am totally staying here again next time i 'm in vegas .
0	earlier today my friend & i ate here . she seemed to enjoy her meal . mine tasted fine . unfortunately i got in my car leaving applebee 's parking lot feeling extremely ill. i had to restrain from vomiting the entire ride home ( this was my first meal of the day ) . i have been sick ever since i ate there . do not order the bruschetta salad . in fact , just do not go there . period . your stomach may thank you . i called applebee 's to let them know , and the manager was very stoic and said an insurance company would contact me shortly . that 's it . no apology . nothing other than , 'what 's your name and when did you come here ? '' so in summary , i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
0	big crooks liars people jim is the biggest thief .he charge for parts that not need to be fix or replacement .watch out people from this place .
0	cappuccino was undrinkable . it was burnt and made me want to cry . i 've found that some barristas at one coffee co. know what they 're doing and others do n't .
1	this is by far one the of best local eateries i have been to . the service and food are always top notch and the place is always clean .
0	i came in to sell my movado and was told they would have to pass on it because they do n't have the tools or specialist to tell if its authentic or not . why are you guys even open then ? will never ever , ever come back to this location and any superpawn for that matter . this location ruined my experience for all locations ! like the previous review , i would put zero stars if i could !
1	re : dinner this place is as consistent as any other in-n-out with less of a wait . it 's a little off the strip , so if you do not have a vehicle if visiting vegas , it would make it tough to eat here . if there 's such thing as quality fast food , this is it . * cheers *
0	at la quinta , no matter where it is located , i have always had a consistently good experience . the rooms are nothing special , but they usually check off our major needs list when we are on a road trip : does it have a clean bed ? check . does it have a hot shower ? check . is it affordable ? check . is it going to be located in the city/town we are stopping in ? check . can they accomodate last minute reservations ? check . do they allow slightly overweight , gas-y , lazy , flat-faced , wrinkly guests ? check . so , i got myself a rewards card and now , no matter where we travel we stay here . honestly , i was pretty bummed we had to stay here on our trip through vegas , though . we had our dog with us so it severly limited the places we could stay in and afford on our trip . ( by the way , that slightly overweight , gas-y , lazy , flat-faced , wrinkly guest i was speaking of earlier was my english bulldog , not my husband . i just want to clarify so i do n't get in trouble later ! ) i was surprised to find that there were a few hotels on the strip that did allow dogs . i have never seen them on the strip or in any hotel/casino , so i just assumed they were n't . but , i was shocked to see that it is considered an upgrade to stay in a dog-friendly room and therefore the price practically doubled per night ! but no fear , the la quinta saved the day ! they even offered a free shuttle that takes you to harrah 's on the strip so you do n't have to keep taking a cab back and forth . it will also pick you up from harrah 's at the end of the night if you just call and wait for it outside by the taxi call . this made having to stay here all the more enjoyable and tolerable . i mean , who seriously wants to stay in some ho-hum hotel off the strip when you are in vegas ? ! not this girl !
1	i 'm always excited to hear that a new restaurant opened up in sun prairie , so the opening of watertower chop house made me happy ! my husband and i tried out watertower on a wednesday night . they have a `` date night '' special on wednesdays with a deal on appetizers , so we were excited to try it . we were served crunchy bread and cheese spread when we sat down , real supper club-style ! we each ordered an entree ( prime rib for my husband and salmon for me ) , so we both got salad bar included with our meals . we were both pretty impressed with the salad bar . our meals were also very good . we 're planning to come back to watertower chop house for sure !
0	i ordered the bento box , with teriyaki tofu today and my friend had the korean beef . the teriyaki had a way too sweet sauce with veggies and tofu over rice . it tasted like a frozen dinner . the tempura coating was very greasy , inside contained something tasteless and part was dark and hard like a bad potato . the egg rolls were mushy and tasted like frozen also . the coleslaw was cabbage with dressing , very unspecial . i do n't know what the greasy eggy pocket filled with rice is called , did n't even try it . my friend liked the sauce on the beef and the rice was okay as well as the piece of shrimp tempura although very greasy . with two sodas our bill was $ 24.00 . even if it was free , i would n't want it . i ca n't imagine this place will last long .
0	when we arrived we headed to the saloon where we seated ourselves , waited a bit for service , when service did arrive , we were told to take our time , but felt rushed by the server . a comment was made because i brought a special salad in i have to eat because of my health and doctor recommendations . my daughter and wife ate off the menu , and i split the lunch with my wife . maybe it 's because of health laws , which i was made aware of by the waiter , but the initial remark sparked this yelp comment . he did tell me later he realized we did order from the menu , but reminded me you do n't come into a bar and bring your own beer ! true , but then i also have to adhere to my food i brought and not letting it spoil in the hot car . i will not say i 'm not at fault on this entirely , but i should have consulted the manager prior . it 's just that b4 making any comments at least question and find out why i had brought in the food ; do n't just assume , or state your policy politely . the ice cream shop would even spot me a small complimentary scoop to see if it agreed with my tastes . so i said ok , never mind and walked out . we did n't even bother going to the mercantile store ! ! i 'd not be interested to revisit this place
0	i have been here before and always enjoyed the coffee . today went with some friends and we all made a comment about the bad attitude of the staff . the girl at the register was rude . i do not think i will be going back anytime soon .
0	i 'd been hearing the hype about frozen hot chocolates for a really long time , but i was unwilling to wait in the long line for the restaurant . but no fear ! there 's a handy little take out line around back . i ordered my frozen hot chocolate , listened to a little one direction over the loudspeaker , and waited for my drink . my frozen hot chocolate was disappointing . it tasted like chocolate powder , and not in a good way . it was something that i felt like i could definitely make for myself , and for much , much cheaper . it was tasty , but definitely not worth waiting around for .
0	my husband and i along with family and friends came here today for lunch and the food is great , but service was n't so much . i ordered the large rice noodle with beef stew , my husband had the big bowl of pho and we split an order of spring rolls . his food came out within 10 minutes and mine took about another 15 minutes . i did n't mind because i was enjoying the time with family and friends . after our meal was out i placed an order of fried rice to go and thought it would be done and ready by the time we were all done and eating . that did n't happen . i waited 20 minutes after we finished our meal and paid . overall food was great , but service was n't . next time i 'll order the to go food when i 'm ordering my meal .

0	if i can give this place zero stars , i would . the room is absolutely horrendous . it 's do disgusting that you dont want to take your shoes off in the room , not even into the bathroom . you also do n't want to touch the door handles in the room , and do n't wait to sit down on the chair and you might want to think twice about sleeping in their bed . this place is under remodeling right now because it 's the old imperial palace which was absolutely disgusting . i wonder if they 're remodel the rooms also because no on will want to stay here . sleeping on the streets might be cleaner .
0	i 'd give it the exact 3.5 stars it has currently for almost no good reason : the waiter service is attentive and satisfactory -- -the food portions are gargantuan and generous -- -the interior is comfortable enough and has fun decoration . the only issue is that picking a restaurant in vegas gets you stuck in a vicinity for a long time unless you cab it . at hash house , you 're stuck at the imperial palace . food was good but not memorable .
0	this is less a bar than a hotel lobby . it lacks a cool vibe or any real feel at all . i did enjoy listening to some nice music but beware the cocktail menu without the prices on the tables . i ordered a drink and it was $ 20 ! they did n't even garnish it as stated in the menu . they forgot my wife 's garnish as well . the drink was ok. it should have been unbelievable for $ 20 . just skip it .
0	my love affair with paco has come to an end . it is not as thrilling as in the early days of a new restaurant . the chips they used to have were light , thin , and they seemed freshly made ; i could n't keep my hands off them . the last time i was there they had the thick corn that was seemed like it was purchased in bulk . in addition , the flavor that once kept me coming back for more , seemed more muted . granted , the food is still okay and the service is still friendly . perhaps `` it 's me , not you . ''
0	went to eat there for `` brazilian wednesday '' and i was very disappointed . the only thing brazilian was this gigantic piece of meat which did not look very appetizing . the ambience of the buffet is that of a hospital cafeteria , very depressing . the service was very good , but for 45 $ for 2 people you 're much better going somewhere else .
1	absolutely loooved this show . the first cirque show i had ever watched was o , so watching zumanity was such a different experience . the seating area is small and cozy , but still very spacious . i loved the cute little couch seating around . the vibe of the whole show was great . i just loved how there was a lot of audience interaction . i love the fact that the creators of the show were able to take sex and express it in very beautiful and classy ways that people would n't normally expect . this show puts a great spin on nude dancing and makes it enjoyable to everyone in the audience . great show . tip : do n't go to the show if you 're up tight or not an open-minded person .
1	my brother , sister , her boyfriend , and i came here after finding out that lotus of siam was closed for the day . we still had a craving for thai food and ended up here . it 's been years since i 've eaten here ! one thing that i love about this place is that you get a gigantic glass of thai tea with just the right amount of ice and mixture of tea and cream . most other places will give you a regular sized glass and fill it up with ice and it 's finished before your food even comes . this gigantic glass lasts throughout the whole meal and then some ! we ordered chicken larb ( medium spicy ) with a side of sticky rice , papaya salad , chicken pad thai , and chicken pad see ew . the entrees came with steamed rice and we did n't have to order it separately . the food altogether was yum . they had asked how spicy we wanted the larb , but they did n't ask for the papaya salad . i feel like they made the papaya salad medium and the larb mild when i had wanted the larb to be medium . the larb was ok , although i 've had better larb at other thai restaurants . i love the homey feel of this restaurant . the way that it is set up makes you feel like you are sitting at home enjoying a home cooked meal . the overall service was excellent and they even packed up our food at the end . the pricing was reasonable as well . for our meal , including 3 thai teas and 1 thai iced coffee , the total came out to $ 75 .
1	this place is awesome ! ! been going here for years the # 1 is the way to go red chili is amazing
0	my only thought about taco guild is that is it not worth it . i love tacos , so it 's safe to say i was looking forward to trying this place . now i 'd like to make it clear that my star total is strictly for the food . the service , the decor and the ambiance are wonderful . this place is beautiful and everyone was super friendly . i will go back just because the experience was awesome , but i wo n't be the one suggesting it , because of the food . the food was alright , but not outstanding . i do like the options . they have a duck taco and a lamb taco . so that 's fun . however , the tacos were small . for $ 4- $ 5 a taco , two should fill me up . and you do n't get a free side unless you buy 3 tacos , otherwise they run about $ 2.50 . i had a side of rice which probably would n't have filled up my hand . i get that they are quality local ingredients , but i feel like the markup is a little ridiculous . if you have a large appetite and a small budget , i do not recommend taco guild . being that we live in arizona , there are many other taco options around . if you do go , go for the building . it is really lovely .
0	i see other diners had similar experiences as we did . i want to support local family owned businesses , but i would never go back to this place . the family tried hard and kept asking if everything was ok. what do you say ? the food is all just really awful ? and why do n't they know that ? they should never even have been open yet . they need to finish remodeling . get rid of the broken fuji buffet sign as you walk in and the graffiti on the door . the tables and buffet lines , decor , are all from two restaurants ago . we were told to take any table we liked . they all looked dirty . normally in a buffet there are little signs on the sneeze shield that tell you what the dishes are . there were post it notes . in poor hand writing . and they did n't always match the food . the cesar salad was a pan with about 2 inches of creamy water and lettuce and soggy croutons floating in it . i tried several different dishes , but the only thing that i even remotely liked was a stuffed tomato . while my niece was up getting food , a man came out with a big can of chocolate pudding and `` glopped '' it in . probably not the best choice . a lot of overcooked , poorly seasoned food . i see some people had hummus . i looked in vain for hummus or pita bread . but there were jalapeno poppers , egg rolls , chicken nuggets and onion rings . we also witnessed the argument over the drinks and also had our drinks refilled from a glass . i feel they were earnest but were incredibly wide of the mark .
0	this place is n't worth your time . there are far better bowling venues in town . so what 's wrong with arsenal bowling ? rude staff . slow bar with limited selection . it 's cramped and dirty . lanes are reserved pretty much 24/7 . misleading specials ( other have posted about this ) . i try to be an easy-going guy , but after trying this place a few times i 'm done giving it another chance .
0	great coffee and cool atmosphere , but when they made a mistake with my breakfast first it was the employees fault for writing the order wrong and then the manager came over to my table to `` clarify '' with me that it was n't their employees fault , but mine for taking the wrong food . the place was full so when she called the name out at the counter i did n't hear her clearly , but saw she was carrying a breakfast burrito , what i ordered , and thought it was mine . who 's responsibility is it to make sure customers get the right product ? theirs . before placing food on the table it would probably be a good idea to confirm the right table is getting the right order . the employees and manager placed blame on each other and then the customer for the mistake , and were completely rude . the coffee is good , and so is their food but rude employees and bad management will ensure i never go back , and encourage others to go somewhere else .
1	this is small vegetarian takeout indian food place.though the menu is limited , food is made freshly . i tired bombay sandwich , samosa , samosa chat , chole , gulab jamun , mango lassi and chai . i have been to this place around 6-7 times and i have seen people coming for tea and samosa ( 5pm snack in india ) . very limited curry menu
0	it 's not a bad hotel for the price . really . the room i stayed in was fine ( save for some odd stains on the curtains ) , the casino and show offerings are about standard ( carrot top , criss angel ) , and there 's a fairly diverse selection of restaurants . that said , if you want to drop an extra $ 40 or $ 50 a night and stay somewhere else , i 'd probably recommend doing that . while i 'd take the luxor over the imperial palace , it 's certainly no caesar 's or mandalay bay .
0	sixty seven dollars ? ! for two buffets ? ! '' unfortunately that was what my buddy and i said on our way in ... and on our way out of this disappointment of vegas buffets . the wait was easily 30min so when we were given the hefty total before being seated we had some hope that our pallets would be much happier than our wallets . alas ... we were left wanting . la village buffet had a pretty ample selection of items from the standard crab legs and prime rib ... to some `` regional '' offerings such as lamb and cheese plates . but even the items i would n't say were `` bad '' were lacking . items that should have carried the buffet just dropped dead . the crab legs tasted and felt like they had been there all day ( the meat did not come out in chucks , yet fell apart ) ... and the prime rib was almost painful to eat ... tasting as though someone needed to leave for break while it was cooking so they just put it out a bit early . save you money peoples . for less mulla you can head over to mirage and have food that is ten times as good ... or spend a little more of that black jack loot and head over to the belagio .
0	do n't be mistaken tqla does n't have mexican food exactly . it is called `` new mexican '' food . while it was pretty delicious i was n't expecting this . the main difference is that there are a lot healthier choices than a mexican food restaurant . the chips and salsa were good . the service was excellent . if you are coming here for traditional mexican food you will be disappointed .
0	i went there with the guys last night for the nachos , which were delicious as always . i really do n't think you can find many better , any especially not for ten dollars . that being said , the service was some of the worst i have ever had eating out . the guy was nice enough , but he was just really bad at his job . everything took so long , from almost thirty minutes to get our nachos ( which was probably not his fault ) , to refilling our drinks ( which did not happen once all night unless we waved him down and asked ) . i do n't ever expect a server to ask if i want another drink when he is still serving my food , or when i ask for another one . the answer is yes , and if you would bring it , that would be great . i have no idea how long it would have taken to get our checks if we would n't have asked for them , and then brought them back to him with our payments . 4 stars for the food , a generous 2 for service
0	zero stars ! i do n't know why we punish ourselves by returning to this place after promising to never return . i guess deep down inside you hope that major changes may have occured but alas .... i am beggin my fellow yelpers to never , ever make the mistake of going to this sorry excuse for a restaurant unless you enjoy a dirty restaurant , cold food , old food , bugs galore ( gnats , flies , and spiders oh my ! .. i 'm sure i could find a roach if i looked hard enough ) , sh * tty management , snotty hostesses , the buffet-attendant drinking a drink at the buffet , and probably the worst & most unfriendliest waitresses you could possibly have , take it from me . go elsewhere . please . if i could afford to pay for billboard space in their parking lot , i would warn the world to stay away . heck , i 'd even pay you guys to put this up on rotd just to help spread the word . your pal , walter
0	when i first walked into tryst and waited at what was likely an elf 's table for 45 minutes without any drinks , i started to seriously second guess my attractiveness . we were a group of 14 ladies 23-24 years old in vegas for a bachelorette party who had reserved bottle service this past saturday . we all had on suggestive , expensive dresses and i am 100 % sure all my friend 's are highly attractive . at other clubs we had used this to our advantage by not waiting lines , demanding strangers buy us drinks , etc , so i was shocked at the response we got from the staff at tryst . they treated us like half of the girls were missing limbs and the rest were missing all their teeth and hair . i soberly waited 45 minutes to be led off into a wooded area where i was sure they were going to make us dig our own graves and then shoot us in the back and bury us-this is how deserted the area was . although conveniently they placed us next to a dumpster so we could freely throw away any garbage that might have collected around us . i thought maybe they were going to offer us janitorial jobs or something for the evening . we waited about another 45 minutes to receive our mixers . i was simply bored out of my mind at this point , so i went to go meet some strangers . luckily the guys we had met at the palm 's pool had reserved a table that day ( we reserved our 's over a month ago ) ... and they had their table in the main area , not in switzerland where we were located . so i happily waltzed over with them and drank their alcohol . i also happily wore my four inch stiletto heels and jumped on your couches , i also freely poured cranberry juice on every surface available . i actually started to have some fun for the evening . i continued to destroy everything in my way that night , dropping bottles on the ground , dumping the ice buckets on the couches , so i think i got my $ 1800 worth . i also got this awesome bedazzled tryst hat that if i openly wore in seattle i hope someone would voluntarily shoot me and put me out of my misery . so thank you tryst , for completely ruining my second night in vegas !
1	in need of a home away from home ? part of the dogs chain , underdogs is rather aptly situated directly under the dogs , which is beside amore dogs . whilst the dogs and amore dogs are restaurants , underdogs is a basement bar that somehow mixes comfy , commmfffyyyy sofas arranged in a living-room type arrangement with lamps and coffee tables , with a whole host of drinks , bar nibbles and food . for either a sunday evening coffee , or a saturday night pre-cocktail sniffter , this is now one of my favourite go-to bars . be prepared to sit down and go `` ohhhhh ! '' at how comfy the sofas are . then `` hmmm '' over the pretty wide range of drinks on offer , and then just wait in a comfy stupour whilst the waitress comes to take your order . it 's table service , and pretty efficient . the ambience is wonderful . low-lighting , cosy , homely yet still somehow sophisticated . although , as i 've discovered , it 's hard to look sophisticated in a shortish skirt whilst fighting the urge to lounge , limbs akimbo , in an arm chair with jd in hand . i came here on a saturday night for the first few drinks of the eve and it really started the night off well . friendly staff , wonderful ambience , really central , and a nice crowd . and if you dine upstairs , all the better to head down here after . verdict : underdogs is the dogs danglies .
0	this place has awful customer service and a bad attitude . it was like being in eastern europe where attendants think they are doing me a favor by selling me something . no thanks . i wo n't be back . meditate on that .
0	i have to say this place is waaaay overhyped in yelp . went for breakfast with my finace\u00e9 a couple of weeks ago . kudos for the original dishes of this place , thou . with all the options around it is not easy to come up with a different breakfast menu . its different than most places . but does it make it better ? ? my main complaints : 1-oj is nooot fresh or natural . wtf ! ! ? you would expect a decent juice madeout of fresh oranges . especially with the high ratings in yelp . nah . 2-burned coffee . yes , burned . 3-slow service . i waited around 30min for a table and when seated , other 10-15min only for the first plates to be served . 4-my fiance\u00e9 ordered the `` popeye crepe '' or something like that . the sauce ( hollandaise ? ) was awful . very greasy , salty , creamy and disgusting . i had the flavor in my mouth all day long . the only decent thing was the walnut pancake . ill stay with eggworks .
1	best fast food burritos in town . pancheros does n't touch this place . adobe is a close second . go with the barbacoa .
0	this was our first time after hearing that the food was good . this is also our last time . the waiter actually lied to us and i caught him and he knows i caught him ! everything was fine . food was pretty good and my party and i even discussed coming back because we thought the food was good . while waiting for our food we asked for more bread . alfredo , our waiter barely acknowledged our request but we knew he heard us . we waited and the bread never came . our food arrives and we ask for the bread again . he barely acknowledges us again . still no bread . we 're almost done eating . alfredo comes and says bread is being freshly made and will be about 10 minutes . we say fine . a few minutes later i catch alfredo surreptitiously , rushing by with a basket of bread to another table ! unbelievable ! then he comes back to our table , without bread , mind you , and asks if we need anything else . i ask what the deal with the bread is and he says , of course , he 'll bring it right away ! i say never mind , just bring the check ... i did call the gm to make her aware of what happened but we will never be going back there . again , food was good . if you want decent food with bad service , then check it out . your choice .
0	just do n't eat at the one in the airport . cold food .
1	i was around when sgc first started talking about building a state of the art gun range and retail outlet . to be honest , i was skeptical the market could handle an upmarket gun store . i have been shooting competitively my entire life , and currently shoot three to four times a week in organized matches . so i was , and am still thrilled at the success of the club . their prices are not unreasonable , considering the location , and their staff are great . i have taken their concealed carry course with attorney tim forschey . he is in a word , awesome ! this is my fifth ccw course ( i repeat them to stay up to date with changes in the law ) and to be honest , the legal side is a little boring . but tim is great , making it both interesting , as well as practical . i have also shot at their indoor range , and its a great facility . i have heard people say not all their staff are helpful . i guess all businesses have that , but i know many of the their people , and the ones i deal with are experts in their field .
0	i heard the food is good . i will visit very soon
1	i just found this place last week 12/31 , 2014 , the last day of 2014. i have to say , their crepe is the most delicious i have had . so so good ! ! ! i also love their coffee ! the service is good too . the waiter is friendly and cute ! he gave me free small and cute desert and starter . ; - ) . you probably have to wait for a while to get your food . but i suggest you just laid back and enjoy the waiting and the atmosphere of the store .
1	quick , helpful , and clean what else do you want ?
1	awesome find . loved all the choices , loved that you could get large and small portions . great service , great atmosphere , great prices , great food . oh we did n't mention the awesome draft beer choices and prices ! we 'd be regulars if we lived here . this is what yelp is all about ... thank you yelpers for helping us find this place !
0	the food here is over the top excessively greasy . so greasy that it made me sick to my stomach before i was done eating my meal . my husband and i split the chocolate chip pancakes and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and toast on the side . not only was everything in a pool of grease , but it seemed to be margarine ... not even real butter . i will never eat here again . i am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again .
0	very elegant but after our bad day we decided to eat here and this was our last day so we enter it was clean only few people by the bar i order the fagioli soup it was good , and veal piccata i did like the flavor but vegetables to plain of flavor , hubby order lasagna he did n't like it and the bread they serve it really good also the vinaigrette they serve i really love he flavor so it was good for the prize we pay
0	food was enjoyable and there was plenty . i just hate when restaurants cheapen the quality of the meat . the steak used to be actual steak but is now a cheap philly steak type of thing and charging for the sauce that used to be put on the food is a bit much as well .
1	great stuff , great service . bought about 12 shirts at half price of macy 's and some awesome mouth and shin guards ! such a deal !
0	i have stayed here many times , but i will now find somewhere else to stay . the front desk people are never very friendly . our first room of this last visit was nasty . the bathroom tile was coming up and the door hinges were rusty and the paint was coming off the wall near the tub . the tub had grout coming off . no continuing maintenance is going on . our a/c did not work and we had to be transferred at 11:30 pm to another room . this means that the maid did not report it not working or that they did not fix it . our second room was almost as bad . the bathroom was in the same sorry shape , but the room was nicer . the casino is always fun and great priced for being small and off the strip . the pool can get a little crowded , but the pool bar and hooters restaurant overlooking the pool are fun . i wo n't be back until some remodel is done . going to try the `` new '' tropicana .
1	absolutely love the encore , food and live jazz . they have the best green chile pork i have ever had . i live their wood fired food . we also shared the french bacon burger on fresh bread . the very best bloody mary 's ever . this place just feels right . an absolute must when we are on town .
0	it 's so bad ... over salted food ( rivals pickled foods ) from the butter to the dry rotisserie chkn breast , everything priced at least 3x what it 's really worth . fried chkn plate is over $ 20 for about $ 3 of ingredients . smart location near lobby and augustus tower , it 's unfortunate they take that fully for granted . service was pretty lousy , i get that xmas eve is n't gon na have the a team but they did n't have to suck either . water tasted bad as well , it does n't cost much to filter water , should be a standard at a restaurant that 's $ 20-30/entree range .
0	the first time i visited , i had an awful lobster roll . i love lobster rolls so much , so you can imagine how much i was disappointed . i vowed to never return . however , a decent amount of my co-workers insisted it was one of their favorite lunch spots . after months and months of resistance , i finally went back . i got the choose 4 option for lunch , which was pretty cool . i love to try different things , so i feel like this was a great option . prosciutto wrapped melon , mushroom mac and cheese , brussels , and grilled salmon . all were good . i saved the salmon for last . it was my least favorite because of the completely different flavor profile it had from the other dishes . it was packed with asian flavors , and it sort of shocked my taste buds . the tastes being so profoundly different than the rest of my meal really threw me off . i definitely was n't expecting that flavor profile to be in any dish at an italian restaurant . i 'm sure it will be some time before i return , but after round 2 , vallozzi 's somewhat redeemed itself . just take my advice and stay away from the lobster roll .
1	really nice steakhouse . the food was absolutely fine and the stuff very friendly . we will come back as soon we are back in montreal !
0	stopped at this macy 's to kill a lil time . took back a guess watch that was purchased recently and appeared to be a lemon . after some strong negotiations and resistance from a sales associate manager frankie was called to the scene . frankie heard us out , inspected the watch then took the issue to her general manager . finally it was approved to do a even exchange for a new guess watch ... so i was refitted and on my way ( :
0	this is one of my regular stops for breakfast . normally a great breakfast joint but not today . the greeter was n't friendly and the food was average . this place has been around for a long time with a good reputation . the kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly , happy greeter . it will be a while before i go back .
1	i checked this place out just before new year 's eve . the pizza is not exactly the same as the original made by dom demarco , but pretty close . i found the crust to be tougher and thicker than the original . and , i could n't tell if they added the olive oil at the end like dom does . i guess i miss the whole ritual of watching him make my specially ordered pizza right in front of me . if you do n't know what i 'm talking about , youtube difara pizza . besides these comments , i would say that the taste and essence of the pizza is almost bang-on to the brooklyn-made pie by the pizza `` phenom '' himself . the blend of toppings definitely says `` difara '' . i will most certainly go back the next time i 'm in vegas . btw i thought they would have had at least 1 photo of the `` main man '' in the restaurant . perhaps , i missed it ! ! !
0	humble pie at desert ridge is great ! this one is much closer to my home . i was hoping that because they are run by the same company they would be similar . the difference is night & day . the happy valley location is so poorly run i will never return . the were 4 young women as hostesses but only one bartender . the wait staff was very over loaded . the bar area was too small . the crowd was very good for the 1st week of opening , but the service will have to improve dramatically to keep them coming back .
0	we enjoyed this buffet . it was a little too pricey considering the bellagio ( which is awesome ) is only a few dollars more . but there was quite a variety of items , and staff were pleasant . not sure if i would return with all the other options on the strip .
1	ate here with a group . everyone enjoyed their meal . can wait to return to vegas to eat their again . i had the brisket dog , so yummy !
1	awesome ! i was going to dock this place 1 star for the prices but then i realized they were pretty consistent with every other steakhouse i 've eaten in . i went with a group 7 and we unanimously decided that this steakhouse was amongst the best we 've dined in-not one complaint . my lamb chops , although not medium well as i requested , was very tender and flavorful . the broccoli rob that accompanied the lamb was good but a bit more bitter than i was anticipating . fries were great . what sets this steakhouse apart from the rest was the ambiance . the windows of the place looked right out on to the bellagio lake ; we got great views of the water show all throughout the meal ... nice little touch . service was outstanding ; our waiter was polite , professional and attentive . like i said , a standard 3 course meal with drink and tip will cost well over $ 100pp so be prepared for that . bottom line-highly recommended , particularly if you 're not on a budget .
0	i nom nom nommed at the pyramid cafe because of it 's convenience , open 24 hours . few things are `` cheap '' in vegas but the cheeseburger was a good value for it 's price . i got it with fries and having not eatens for almost a whole days , i still could n't nom nom nom the whole burgers or fries . i got it to goes and they packed it with all sorts of condiments . i had enough leftovers from that nights to last me the next day but then again , i are a small cat . i was satisfied with the portions and the way it was prepared ( grilled buns , nicely melted cheese , evenly cooked fries ) and overall , it was a good , simple staple meal but not amazing . i would orders it again if i was cravings it though .
0	i have had mediocre service at the other best buy locations in town . this one , however , took the cake . i called before arriving , to pick up a popular tv-on-dvd series , and was told they had several in stock of both regular dvd and blu-ray . when i arrive , there is limited signage and organization to this location . i finally locate the right department , and there are only blu-ray copies of this dvd available . it takes several minutes to locate an employee . employee a comes over , hears my dilemma , and stares at the shelf . i have to prompt him to look up whether other copies are available and if perhaps there is another display featuring this series . he seems high as a kite and does not seem to understand the problem . after waiting several minutes , employee b finishes nearby with another customer , hears the synopsis of my situation , and locates the dvd in question in under two minutes with a smile on his face . i 'm generally not one to review chain stores very often , or to judge employees based on their handling of one customer , but you either need to be more discerning with your hiring practices or amp up your training procedures if someone can be this thoroughly inept while on the clock at your business .
0	used to be better . beef chow fun had hardly any beef in it . walnut shrimp over cooked . chicken tsao over cooked too much fatty chicken . yuck !
1	i do n't give out many 5 's . let me explain why they get a 5. they are better than any of the chinese fast food places i have been . the food was plentiful , hot , and taste . the service was good . i just do n't think it could get better . i drive to arrowhead area several times a week and have seen yu 's . they are new and have only been open a couple of weeks . since they are in my neighborhood , i thought i should give them a try . very clean and friendly place . we went in at lunch time and looked at the lunch menu . they have lunch meals for less than $ 6.00 . with drink was just over $ 7.00 per meal . i got the house chicken . marked spicy . not overly spicy but i am used to eating some very hot foods so i am not always the best person to ask . my wife got the orange chicken . wow . we got enough food to feed 4 or 5 people . depending on how hungry you are there is enough food to feed 3 people in each meal . the food was good , and temperature was hot , hot as they cook it while you wait . much better than the other oriental food places in the area . i will be back . many times . this place just got started . go see them . you will enjoy your food and service .
0	i came here for lunch for restaurant week with one guest around 2pm . verdict : come here if you 're an executive working nearby who wants a yummy soup and salad and make the disgruntled employees feel like trash ( someone with their big handbag would n't move out of the aisle ) . do n't come here if you believe in genuine meals . ambiance : 5/5 you are greeted by delicious scents and sunshine as you walk in . high ceilings and bright lighting help to set the mood . rustic yet polished , it sets expectations for an unpretentious lunch . service : 2/5 hostess did not smile or greet , tried to wave waiter down to order something else and even made eye contact ( gave up after trying three times ) , and not a single `` how are enjoying your meal '' was given . so , i took off a star for each . food was timely , hence two stars . food : 2/5 their quinoa salad was amazing : light , refreshing , and fluffy . everything after was average or lackluster . their burger was balanced , but the chicken was reminiscent of jack . thin meat , not particularly tender , no juice . bun was good , but average for a gourmet burger . the salad might have saved the meal , but the cheese chunks were cloying . key lime pie was too tart : i felt the top of my nose slightly sweet . value : 2/5 to the owner 's benefit , i appreciate their participation in restaurant week to benefit charity . that kindness is not being disputed in this review . what is being disputed , though , is if i will come back here regularly . at the price point of $ 30 per person , i have had friendly and attentive service , balanced flavor profiles with rare ingredients , and pleasant memories elsewhere for american upscale casual . especially since the regular menu adds up more , this actually further decreases value . mood and stomach after the meal : hmph . total rating : 2 out of 5 .
0	one of the rare spots i 've experienced here in vegas that totally reminded me of hollywood/los angeles . came here ona sunday afternoon/brunch and this place was stuffed to the rim ! there was no line out the door but once i opened it , it was like new year 's eve on the vegas strip ! well , it was nothing new to me as this is a common occurence in my home town . the hostess tells us that the wait was gon na be around 45min - 1hr . so , i squeezed my way to the bar and ordered the infamous brunch beverage - mimosa . about 10 minutes later , i was still thirsty , so i ordered a tangerine mimosa . i never tried this combination before and i must say it was awesome ! finally , get seated , about 40 minutes later , and by this time i practically memorized half the menu . andy 's sage fried chicken .. : served on a big plate , stacked architecturally sound and i could n't wait to have a bite ! the chicken , bacon mashed potaotes , eggs , biscuit .. everything just worked and was more than filling ! french toast : another enormous dish ! extra thick bread with galloping amounts of pecan maple syrup and pieces of banana . it was n't great but not bad either . kiwi watermelon lemonade : awesome combination and came with a fat slice of watermelon as its garnish . considering the long wait , the alright tasting food , the claim jumper sized portions and the great drinks .. i ca n't say i 'd be back for a second round . i can only vouch for the generosity of food and the beverages at most ..
0	i try to avoid this market unless its absolutely necessary . not because the selection is n't great or because the staff is n't friendly . its because its almost always overly busy !
0	despite the name , you ca n't use coins here . everything is operated with a special cash card you must buy on site and you can only pay for with bills . no coins , no debit or credit cards , just bills . if i had actually been able to use any of the machines i might have been able to leave a better review . the place is very clean and attended with machines that appear to be very well maintained .
0	we just ordered take-out because this restaurant is close to where we live . we ordered chicken tenders as well as chips and salsa . three tenders came with the appetizer and the chips and salsa had barely any salsa as well as chips . the tenders are paper thin and cost 10 bucks and only come with 3 tenders ! there were barely any chips and barely any salsa ... yet these were 6 bucks ! we will never eat here again as there are other places even closer in lake las vegas that are actually a bargain and you get your moneys worth ! very disappointed !
1	rushing water , bridges , ducks , roadrunners , creek , pathways - am i in vegas ? the wetlands park was recently renovated with a nature center with fun and informative activities for people of all ages . this unexpected experience in the desert is a great place for a walk or bike as paved and sand trails weave through the natural preserve and the wash. i recommend starting or ending your days here to watch the sun rise or set in the park and over the valley .
0	this gallery has an explicit policy on their website that they will not entertain the art of any local artist . i hope that the public will avoid them and instead go to galleries that allow charlotte artists an opportunity to exhibit their work .
0	this is a review for the craft classes offered at this joanns location . i stopped taking classes at this joanns about 2 years ago because both rooms they offered the classes in were freezing cold . it was very hard to sit in these rooms for 2-3 hours and learn a craft or work on a project . i was not the only person who felt these rooms were too cold , the instructors and other `` pupils '' also thought it was very cold . i tried to take another class again this year because there was a new class that very much interested me . however after 2 years , the freezing cold environment of the room had still not been addressed by the joanns staff . you would think the customer and instructor feedback would make them heat the room or get space heaters . nope , they just do n't care if you are uncomfortable while you are paying to take a class there . i find that unacceptable and even though the classes are interesting and the instructors are fun and knowledgeable - i will never take a class there again . how hard can it be to heat a freaking room in the winter ?
0	my fianc\u00e9 and i were looking for bbq on the 4th of july and decided to stop at toms . i was looking for a reminder of how delicious bbq is . for it to be the 4th of july the food was not satisfying . the ribs had lots of fatty pieces . the mac n cheese was bland and it 's possible that it was from the day before . the bake beans were straight from a can no unique taste . this place is good for someone who has never had bbq before ...
0	i 'd love to stretch to 4 stars on this one but i just ca n't . for mesa , it 's about as good as it gets . great location off val vista , food is above average , drinks well made . staff is very friendly and attentive . not sure what it is , it 's just missing something ? the bar is usually the happening place . great for small/medium groups as you can score a seat almost any night of the week .
1	alright , i 'm not gon na lie . i like oregano 's . i 've only dined here a couple of times over the last couple of years . that is , after trying to eat here on more than several occasions and leaving annoyed with the parking or the hour wait on a friday night ( seriously , whyyy ? ? ) . i thought for sure i was over the whole oregano 's bit until friday night , when the boy suggested we bring my visiting mother there for dinner . i agreed , we went , we parked ( good parking , too ) , we waited the 45 minutes , and we ate . let me say this again , we ate . ate and ate and ate and ate . two appetizers , three entrees , three cocktails , and a pizzookie later , we were completely beat . and we left with four to-go boxes ... the food was all delicious . yes , it was commercial and not spectacular , but it was good . i recommend the boom dip , meatball sub , bollo pasta , and the glorious half-baked , warm , gooey cookie with ice cream on top ( i do n't think they can call it a `` pizzookie '' anymore , law suit or something ) . mmmm . the drinks are all great , too , but i must warn you , they have a two drink maximum , so i would n't plan on drinking too much while you 're there . over all , it was a fun experience . the atmosphere is great ( it 's loud ) , the servers are friendly , and if you have the right friends with you , you 're guaranteed to have a good time .
0	pub crawl stop 6 ( finale ) : this spot is just down from my office and the only spot that i visited using the light rail for my light rail pub crawl . by this time i was completely hammered and although hungry , i did n't want to wait for the $ 5 special of burger , fries and domestic beer . when you consider the domestic beer was $ 2 , that 's a good deal for the food - but i just ordered one domestic beer . i ca n't recall much about this place . i would like to go back when i am not so out of it because i have heard they have good food and great drink specials
1	i had a problem with my aqua logic main board and digital time clock at my home in chandler . flip at gentry fixed it quickly and pricing was very reasonable . they were recommended by my pool maintenance man . the follow up and coordination by stephanie in the office was equally fantastic . i recommend gentry for pool repair and will use them again in the future . phil
0	my son has ot in the same parking lot , so i have come to this place a few times for lunch . first thing that turned me off was a huge tip jar they have in your face when you order . they have a sign saying that they prefer cash , and that 'credit card and debit card fees break small businesses ' . huh ? the first thing i ate here was shrimp fajitas , which with drink was about $ 15 . very small portions and not worth it . chips are ok , but the salsa and picante sauce are in squirt bottles ... and cold as heck . if you want any kind of side , it costs a dollar or more . i got a burrito the next time i came here ( it was good , the healthy bean one ) and it is 5.50 , but if you want sour cream , guacamole , and chicken ( they try to press it on you ) that will be another nearly 5 bucks . it 's good but not very big . drinks are in small styrofoam cups and cost 2 bucks . they have a sign saying no outside drinks . i can see why , they have a racket going here on their overpriced drinks . the straw that broke the camel 's back is that i waited in line behind two people who could n't make up their mind for twenty minutes , and the woman behind the counter tried to help the woman behind me first . wtf ? not great service , food is ok with skimpy portions , cheapo atmosphere , tip jar in your face ... skip this place .
1	i have visited la unica many times and the experience has always been consistent ... excellent food and excellent service . i am hooked on the tacos la unica . two or three of these and i am happy ! i have also dined on many of the specials mainly during the lunch hour and they have all been excellent . the chips and salsa are free . the food prices are very reasonable for the quality . we have never had a bad experience . the staff is always prompt and polite . the manager always makes an effort to stop by and say hello to us and make sure we are being taken care of and that the food is good . my family loves to go to la unica and asks all the time to go . now that la unica is on my mind , maybe i 'll be the one asking to go tonight ! i would give five stars if they had cervesas or margaritas , but consider this a 4.5 .
0	the ambiance was nice . but the bartenders were rude . we were handed our drinks and never heard from our bartender , herbie , again . what 's the point of looking at something nice if the service is poor . pretty on the outside , ugly on the inside .
1	love love love . there 's not much to be said . if you make my coffee good i will love you forever . end of story . super fast service , clean quiet environment . they never make a mistake . i got free coffee from their drive through twice =- ) because they said i waited too long . thank you ! !
0	came into vegas wanting to have some fun on a friday night . you 'd figure that vegas being a place of shows and theatrics there would be plenty of gay venues and each of them would be packed full of gay men . perhaps it 's because we went during a quiet time of the year , but c'mon ! it was after the first night of cher 's long chain of concerts . all in all , it was an average club , nothing to boast about , but certainly nothing awful . i was willing to put up the $ 20 cover thinking that there would be some pretty hot go go dancers and such . i would say that the go go dancers did have nice bodies , but were only `` all right '' all around . i much preferred the waiters who around 1am took off their shirts . most of the people there were from out of town and were already coupled so definitely not a very cruisy place . the dance floor is what you would expect . there are plenty of spots there and they played the typical remixes that you would expect at any other gay venue . i really did n't have an issue with any of the aesthetics , but with all the hype , i really expected to be wowed ... especially for the $ 20 . if you are a las vegas resident , you get in for free so the $ 20 is only for visitors . drinks are around $ 8 and if you plan on going with more than just yourself , i highly suggest reserving a table . i enjoy people watching with the bf so a table would have been nice . all tables and sitting areas surround the dance floor . so if you plan on people watching , you either are in those booths or you 're on the dance floor . drinks were not strong at all . for me that 's not too much of an issue as i get tipsy just sniffing a drink . for my bf it was a total downer especially with the cost of the cover and the drink . it is conveniently located right off the strip . it is diagonally across from crystals so it 's a convenient walk from most hotels on the strip . if you come from a big city ( eg los angeles , san francisco , new york , sydney , moscow or dc ) you 'll probably be disappointed . the club does n't even start to get packed until after midnight so do n't plan on going until then . if you are planning on visiting , make it a long night because the club is very slow at building up a good group of people .
1	this place is hard to beat for noodle and kimchee dishes . excellent milk teas , good smoothies , good prices . decent service , in and out quick as can be . it 's not a 5 for me because there 's a lot of stuff on the menu that is highly authentic , and i have to admit to ordering several dishes at rose tea that i could not believe how much i did not like them . so unless you really dig the down home asian cooking , stick to the noodle , rice , and kimchee dishes .
0	nice open place . the music is very loud . we liked the beer , especially the van horne ipa . the food though , is very average . not awful , but lacking flavour and freshness . so , good place for a good beer , but for the food , you have many interesting options nearby ...
1	we were vacationers looking for a quick , but good mexican meal after a hike . this place did not disappoint . we ordered the parrillada for two , with extra guac and chips . everything was delicious . the chicken was good , and all other meats on the dish ( beef , chorizo , carnitas ) were excellent . if anything , we ordered too much food , but gladly ate nearly all of it . the medium and spicy salsas had both flavor and heat . the wait staff is helpful and friendly . not sure how this place ranks among locals , but for visitors not used to authentic mexican fare , who are looking for a quick and reasonably priced meal , this is the place .
1	you usually ca n't go wrong staying at an embassy suites hotel . the rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy . you can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too !
0	the pepperoni breadstick fondue was amazing and so we 're the drinks i had . the mac and cheese burger was not as outstanding as i would have expected especially since it claimed to win some kind of award . and at nearly $ 20 for the burger alone , it was pretty pricey . all in all , i 'd come back for the apps and drinks , but that 's about it .
1	harlow 's , you bad girl , you . i can taste your huevos rancheros from here ... your fluffy eggs , your sassy salsa , your crispy potatoes . all so scrumptious . oh , what a temptress you are . a deliciously evil temptress . leave me alone - i 'm working . well , working/yelping . ok , just yelping . whatever . i 'm at work . no , i ca n't leave . not now . i 've got a meeting in ten minutes . no , i ca n't reschedule . ok , i can . but i should n't . i really should n't ... aw , screw it - i 'm on my way .
0	felt like it was below quality meat covered with a straight from can type sweet sauce on top
1	i am originally from oregon and they have these stores there . winco at the time was my regular grocery shopping spot and i missed it so much when i left ! when i heard they were opening one here in vegas i was ecstatic ! ! i love this store , the prices are definitely competitive and affordable.the employees are really courteous i 've been asked at times just while walking through if they can help me with something and someone is usually very easy to find if no one is in the immediate area . there is a good produce variety , the bulk section rocks , and the meat selection is fabulous and has really good prices ! bottom line if you live in the northern part of town around 215 and decatur this place is a must go ! i actually make the trip out there from nellis afb because i feel like it 's worth it haha ! i have also told my friends about it and they have now gone and all say the same things . not to mention it 's 24hrs so it fits any schedule !
0	parking in the back is good if you do n't want to valet . check in was pretty smooth and the free cookie was nice . everything you expect from a hotel service was offered . when your review is less then 5 all you want to know is what went wrong . well , not so much what 's wrong but what was missing . was there for business and working in the internet department of business , i could believe how shakey and slow the wifi was . no mini fridge so any food had to be consumed or tossed . biggest thing that erked me was walking in from all the heat i went to look how to turn on the fan but ran into filling the filter out . wow . disgusting . put a pic so you guys could see how i walked into the room with it . other then that and 12.99 for breakfast , everything else was to expectations .
0	we used to go here all the time ... all five or six of us . we always order a supreme for the table but we were informed that the pizzas were now personal pizzas . we ordered five of them as they never have supremes on the line . i guess they did n't take us seriously as the pizzas were never made . after a mishap with some marinara ( no fault of cicis ) and 45 minutes waiting , i asked for my money back and left the store with sauce all over me . the manager refunded the entire amount of the check so cudos to him for that , but to not take your customers request seriously is very poor business practice and they have lost a regular customer !
0	typically , i try to avoid wings these days . i 'm older , and my body just does n't react the same as it used to when i was younger . but , tonight was special . it was my dinner break , and they were the closest and most cost effective place to catch the nfl season opener ! i walked in , and there was nobody there outside of the employees . being my first time in a wingstop , i know i had that `` deer in the headlights '' look on my face . unfortunately , the young lady working the counter did n't notice that i might need some help , because she was counting down her cash register so she could go home . now , i 'm relatively bright , and i 'm extremely literate , so i figured out what i wanted after a little searching ... though , i would have been open to suggestions instead of standing there for five minutes trying to decide what sounded the most palatable . i ended up getting the 10 wing bone-in meal with fries and a drink for about $ 11 . i opted for the regular `` hot '' flavored wings , though they did have a decent variety from which to choose if you think you have the gastrointestinal fortitude to palate them . speaking from former decisions with crazily spiced wings , i do not recommend anything rated higher than good 'ol `` hot '' . the wings and fries came out as quickly as could be expected . the wings themselves were n't bad . the `` hot '' was an excellent choice . not too spicy , not too bland ... just right for my liking . the fries , though ... they were a different story . there were three different levels of french fries in my basket : 1 ) just right 2 ) uncooked 3 ) burnt to a crisp on top of the inconsistency with the fries , they were way over salted ... almost to the point of not being edible . the only saving grace for this place was the fact that they were airing the inaugural game of the 2012 nfl season . the service was meh , the food was meh , but the circumstances were fantastic . somehow , that weird gastric/emotional math equals 3 stars .
0	i 've given this location because it 's not corporately unwed , and my experience with ruth chris steakhouse is the privately owned ones skimp too much . they did n't have everything because they were still waiting for approval . i had crab legs and bone in filet medium rare . the crab kegs were soft and not too tasty . i did n't enjoy them at all . the filet came out well done at the first cuts . when i told them i only eat it medium rare , they told me to cut close to the bone , it should be medium rare there . what ? ? so i throw away 75 % of the $ 67 steak to get what i want . they finally took it , but then brought back a steak rare . since i do n't live here , i could n't get it to go to cook more at home . they then told me to jet it rest longer so it would cook more . really ? ! ? it was tender , but little flavor . the chopped salad was as amazing as ever , but the bakes potato was cold with no little sides for such a big potato . someone had the $ 90 lobster . it was tough , and not worth $ 90 . i highly recommend ruth chris , just not the one in harrahs .
0	i was disappointed with my experience , but i 'm willing to give it another shot . the main problem was our waiter . we had very slow service . we were seated outside and had to go in to ask for our menus . i ordered coffee and half-and-half , but i did n't get a spoon or something to stir it with , which i thought was odd . i just kind of swished it around ... it was weird . our waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke , tomato and asiago . however , when it arrived the artichokes were not there . it was very disappointing . the breakfast potatoes were also a real let down . i love potatoes and they failed . however , the biscuit was delicious . we also ordered pie . two of our party ordered the fat elvis - which does not come in a pie-form - so they were upset . their other waiter must have made that mistake . i went for the key lime pie which was delicious . the fat elvis was replaced with a drumstick ( ? ) which i guess was good , but i do n't like peanut butter . another thing is if you sit outside , they will give you plastic silverware . i did n't mind , but others in my party did . also , they only take visa and mastercard . overall , the food was good , but the service was not . andrew k attempted to show off his humor ( `` elvis has left the building '' ) , but we found it rather obnoxious because we were sick of waiting . i 'll give him some slack because there were a lot of people seated outside , but i feel he could have paid a bit more attention .
0	hole in the wall with mediocre food would not go back !
0	i have been going to north for 10 years . it once was a cool , layed back place with great service and food . the bartenders knew their regulars and there were a lot . sorry sam fox . no longer true . it is so hot in there and the service is awful .. i asked if i could sample 2 wines . i was given a dime size of wine each time . i settled on conte fini pino grigio . a safe no brainer . bartender opened the bottle then sat it down at the bar gave us 2 empty glasses , then left . she did n't even pour 1 glass . and the wine was warm . the pizza of the day was cheese and sausage . i asked if i could get it with out sausage but with a little basil on top . no i was told . it would cost a dollar . ok i said . the pizza was like cardboard with crust . it used to be great . what happened ? it was crowded so i guess they do n't care .
1	i 'm torn between shouting from the rooftops about how much i love arrivederci 's happy hour and keeping it as my own little secret so it does n't become overcrowded . well . . . here it goes , fingers crossed ! we had been here for dinner a few times and were very pleased , we decided we needed to try their happy hour . i 'm so glad we did ; this is one of my new favorite quiet happy hour spots . not quite as trendy as va bene , but that 's a good thing . less of a singles scene , less noisy and the food is just as delicious ! happy hour is m-f 5-7. we walked in a few minutes after 5 and were greeted by a very friendly bartender . he kindly brought us menus and explained that during happy hour all wines by the glass are $ 5 . wonderful ! ! he brought us some water ( with a slice of cucumber , nice touch ) , took our drink orders , and gave us a few minutes to decide on food . in addition to the wine specials , there are happy hour food specials ! half off bruschetta , pizza , and other appetizers . we went with the calamari in umido ( large tube calamari saut\u00e9ed in white wine & clam broth with a touch of tomato ) and the margherita pizza . they make their own mozzarella here , people ! ! before we received the appetizers , the bartender gave us some fresh bread with oil and balsamic to snack on . the calamari came out first and it was fabulous , as was using the free bread to sop up the amazing broth ! then came the pizza and while it did n't blow me away , it was still very good and that mozzarella is so creamy and fresh ! as embarrassed as i am to admit it , we got three rounds of that yummy bread to use for that delicious broth of the calamari . the best part , the bartender did n't seem to mind a bit that we were being a little greedy with the free bread ! what a nice guy ! did i mention the bread and broth were delicious ? the bar area is nice with a small-ish size bar and a few high-top tables . my favorite part was the living room set up past the bar . some comfy couches and a projection screen . i ca n't wait to plan a friendly group happy hour so we can lounge around on the couches drinking wine and snacking on appetizers . the service was great , the food was great , the price was right , and the atmosphere is cool and cozy . what more can a girl ask for ? a couple more times like this , and this is a five star rating . . . easy !
1	war zuf\u00e4llig hier . der d\u00f6ner hat auf anhieb geschmeckt . so sollte er sein . der umweg lohnt sich f\u00fcr mich .
0	old town whiskey is closed .
0	i try and avoid vons at all costs because of their prices . i feel that if you do n't have the rewards card , you are over-paying by a ton . in fact even if you have the card , i never feel like the item is on sale . the plus is that the store is clean and the staff is friendly . however this is not a sit down restaurant so i care more about pricing for goods i get get anywhere else , more than a friendly cashier .
0	scheduled a rental of a mustang convertible for a day . exactly 18 minutes before my pickup time , i received a call stating they did n't have my car - i thought to myself , no problem , they will give me something comparable or better at the same price . they offered me a jeep wrangler - how is that a sports car ? i asked for a sports car replacement and they said they could offer me a bmw z4 at $ 50 more/day . i said that was not a reasonable suggestion - `` she '' disagreed with me and said that was all she could do . i had a day planned to take my wife on a nice trip to hover dam - but she said forget it if they ca n't find a suitable replacement at the same price on my reservation . trying to find another comparable car at the last minute was not going to happen from another agency - so we bagged the hover dam expedition . do n't use these guys - they do n't treat you like a valued customer .
0	okay , 1st off went there with the office homies , food was good but it was office lunch time so very limited seating and and bit nosiy around that time . one thing i do remember is that we all ordered at the same time , and as our orders came up we were waiting for my buddies food , well what happened was that an girl walked past the line and you can tell she knew the cashier .. well guess what happend next my buddy was still waiting for his food , due to the limited lunch time we started eating , the casier bagged up his order and gave it to the girl who cut in line ( what ! ! ) boy talk about wrong ! ! ! my buddy ( nick ) was bringing me there for my first time to check this place out and they gave away his food .. ( hot mess ) so they offered a free ( stale dessert ) my buddy took it like a champ ! but a new gyro place opened across the street from our office and now we go there . there food it quick and people are friendly and there fries are much better . also they give us a dicount when we show our badges which is always a plus .... yea !
1	sin city vapor .... they 're the ones that enabled me ! ooooh , i was like a fish to bait , and now i 'm hooked on vaping . this place is a stone 's throw away from my apartment . so i go a lot . it 's not my favorite vape shop , but what gives them 5+ stars is their great customer service . they are knowledgeable and ready to help . unfortunately , they 're always busy , every time i walk in there 's 3-4 other customers ( rare for a vape shop ) so i 've had to wait , but it was worth it . i just bought a cartomizer there the other day , and the asian guy showed me how to use it and primed it for me ! wow , talk about customer service . they 're also friendly about sampling their liquids . they have stools and do n't pressure you into buying but you can hang out and sample as many liquids as you want . very cool . they 've also got great prices on their cartomizers , it 's $ 5 for one and if you buy 4 , you get the 5th free . unfortunately i 'm not a fan of their liquid , which they custom make for you at your specific nic level . some flavors are great , such as peaches or pears , but i 've noticed their liquids have a bite and they 're not vapable all day . their clove flavor at a high nic level was the worst . it tore up my throat and mouth . but other flavors , such as smooth cowboy , i 've been able to vape all day with no problems . all in all , sin city has a special place in my heart as my first vape shop . the only thing i wish they did was carry other people 's liquids . there 's so many good e-liquids creators out there , it 's hard to limit oneself to one .
0	roku is to sushi as `` the golden child '' is to eddie murphy movies -- far closer to the bottom than the top . roll selection was weak , and construction was worse . having said that , their crab dynamite was delicious .
1	love love love this spa ! ! ! i have watched them grow and expand , while maintaining their amazing customer service ! i can get it all here ! gel manis , pedis , waxing and even eye lash extensions ! i wo n't go anywhere else !
1	this place is always such helpful to me the employees greet you when you first walk in the door they are helpful to and it 's always nice in the store this is by far my favorite walgreens in las vegas i recommend everyone to come and check this one out
0	it was ok .... over priced for some rogies , they were good but not the best i 've ever had . . i 'll give this place another chance tho . i really like the fact that they are open until 2 on weekends ...
0	one star because my meal rocked . i had the hawaiian sliders . the wait was 30 min at 10:15 am . we waited 10 min at our table before we received water and coffee . we then had to ask 4 times for coffee refills which took about 10 minutes each time to get . that 's another 40 min . i do n't want to ever have to ask . `` our '' waiter never actually refilled it . mikey was too busy . another female waitress overheard us complaining and she refilled it once . one of the meals that came out was cold . i mean cold ... the cheese was n't even trying to melt . it was not good . we sent it back with little apology from our `` waiter . '' i had to ask for a coke refill . again why am i having to do this ? we then asked for butter for the pancakes . i swear to you 7 minutes passes and he comes back and says , `` oh i forgot the butter , do you still want it ? '' no . no . no . screw this we are done . as we paid and the young man asked if it was ok and we said no it was actually a bad experience for our first time there . he simply took our money and never looked up . that 's crap in my opinion . you just lost a potential customer for the duration of our vegas living . the `` manager '' looked just as lost as the rest if the staff while she was taking names to be seated and not back running the kitchen and doing quality assurance checks . what a crock . i chose not to say anything to her because i felt like that was a moot point as well . on a side note there is only one restroom for the males and one for the females . we used the men 's once because it stupid to stand in line that long for the women 's . this place is huge and it 's not equipped to handle the volume .
1	tip : 15 minute wait on a packed morning is super efficient . breakfast crepes were out of the ordinary . it 's basically an omelet wrapped in a crepe ; a must try . too much home style potatoes . good coffee . flip the happy face egg to a sad face egg for prompt service .
1	what a unique place to visit ! alittle touristy , but alot of great spots for photo ops . there is not much , but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out !
0	i have been using this facility for several years . the doctor 's service has been fine , however the office has continually gotten worse . when calling the office it is usually a minimum wait of 20 minutes . several times i have been disconnected . i feel they need to get better or more office workers who appreciate a persons time .
0	i tried this place for lunch , and do n't think i 'll be going back . i love panang curry , and was really dissappointed here . i liked the heat this curry packed , but the lemon zing was wayyyyy too overpowering .... so much so that i did n't even eat the left overs ( and i always eat leftovers ) ! ! furthermore , this place was pretty pricey ... for lunch i paid 10+ just for the curry and brown rice ! try thai basil if you 're in the tempe area , their curry is to die for !
0	had decent food , but shitty service . never returning .
1	food was very good . i had the reuben sandwich . my only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything . otherwise , i recommend it .
0	i usually do n't enjoy giving places 1 star , but this has been the worst cupcake experience yet . my sister and i went to try these cupcakes . she had a red velvet cupcake , and i had a carrot cake cupcake . both were topped with a 'cream cheese ' frosting . we both experienced a very alarming chemical aftertaste from the frosting . the cupcakes were kept cold , which left the texture and flavor of the cake rather dry . we also picked up a few cupcakes for our parents , a banana cupcake with a 'peanut butter ' frosting , and a coffee cupcake with a 'coffee frosting . ' the frosting screams vegetable shortening , both in texture , taste and mouthfeel . i would not recommend this place for cupcakes , there are better bakeries in town .
0	food was ok , arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door . took about 15 minutes to place an order . i ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes . while the food was good took a little too long for the environment . sever never checked after food was dropped . sadly cant say i would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there
1	had the super nachos and hard shell taco . nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat .
0	first off , i do n't eat donuts . that said as a child i loved them . now i have children and they love them . it is so fun for them to stand in front of the case and look at all the donuts before picking the one they want to buy and eat . this location was very clean and the gentleman who waited on us was friendly . the kids said they enjoyed the donuts as much as they do at bosa donuts . i do miss the hot and ready ones from az mills mall though .
0	ever hear the statement , `` if their bathrooms are n't clean nothing else is '' wow were these bathrooms trashed . not just dirty , but over the top off . this is just a cheap , dirty place . as a sports bar i give it a 1 maybe 2 stars . tube tvs ? are you serious ? almost all of them were tubed ... hello ? welcome to the 90s . food is a 1 but i guess it depends on how much you drank . service was bad , and i mean bad . the server even said so , which kind of made up for the bad part of it , but still ... it was bad . i find it kind of interesting that the server comes over with a leg brace on and freely tells us that it was due to a slip and fall in the kitchen . shocker ... i honestly just ca n't see any of my friends ever pulling me back into this place . parking-sucked bathrooms-sucked service-sucked tvs-sucked food-sucked ( but was probably the best part , and it still sucked ) eeek ...
0	good portions and cocktails overall . the best thing i tasted was the pretzel and fondue appetizer . stay away from the curry chicken , it was small and did n't have much chicken in it .
0	i am a real food guy . a good meal makes me very happy . i am very familiar with and love japanese ramen . i had read about this restaurant and had lunch here today , but when i left , i only had a small smile on my face . i had the tonkotsu ramen , a good basic ramen . the noodles were very small , and all stuck together . how does that happen ? i like thick and chewy noodles , so i was disappointed . next , the broth . it was thin and not very flavorful or rich . had no depth , a single note of flavor . the pork bacon pieces were smoky and flavorful , but only two small pieces ? the motif is tokyo ramen shop , with a long counter with stools , facing the kitchen , but not within view of the chefs . a few tables are against the opposite wall . it is quite attractive , really . i hope they stay around long enough to find their way .
0	the restaurant itself is beautiful , very classic steakhouse , as is the menu . as we went for an early dinner on a weeknight , it was not crowded and we were able to get a table right away without a wait . the service was very attentive and nice , but our server did n't seem to be very knowledgable about menu or drink offerings . we started off with the beef carpaccio and the seafood tower . i was impressed with the seafood tower- it was amazing ! lump crab , jumbo shrimp , stone crab , lobster , and oysters . all of my favorite things ! ! the accompanying sauces were also good , but my friend did not realize that one was fresh horseradish and took a huge scoop of it on his shrimp ... omg , that was a bad situation ! ! luckily , it did n't spoil our meal . we ordered the 22 oz ribeye , which they sliced at the table so we could share it . we ordered it medium-rare , and it definitely was undercooked- more rare than med-rare . it also was very fatty . i know that ribeye is a fattier cut , and that 's what i usually like about it , but this was pretty over the top . they did re-cook it for a bit for us , but the damage was pretty much already done . the mushrooms we ordered on the side were delicious , though . the other highlight of my meal was dessert- the cheesecake was fan-tas-tic ! ! one of the best cheesecakes i 've had in quite some time . light , fluffy , moist , melt in your mouth ... it definitely made the meal end on a high note . price -- expensive . surprisingly , the meal was just as expensive as a celeb chef steakhouse on the strip . not quite what i expected , but that is par for the course , i suppose . i 've gone back and forth between a 3 and 4 star review , and finally settled on 3 stars .. i had a fine experience , but not fine enough to say that i 'm a fan .
1	there are only a few stores that i can spend hours in . there are certain stores i do n't like to bring my wife with me also . harbor freight tools is that place . i get the flyers in the mail and start my wish list . it 's like when a a kid gets the toys r us catalog . one has to approach harbor freight tools a little different . are you a professional contractor that has multiple jobs weekly ? well then this place probably is n't for you . you might want to spend a few bucks more to get some better power tools . are you the weekend warrior or the dyi home owner ? then , this is your place . they have a lot of great tools that wo n't be used all the time , but will get the job done . these tools wo n't break you wallet either . i have purchased some specialty tools here that i needed for certain jobs and they were great . i have also purchased a cordless power drill that was a piece of garbage and waste of money . the trick is to go see the quality of the tool and then see how often you will use it . if you only need it a few times and it 's pretty cheap , then get it ! overall this place is awesome . i love going here and finding some great deals . you have to come check this place out . cheers !
1	great ice cream ( perry 's , which is especially exciting for me since i 'm from the buffalo area ) , great flavors , great service and for a great cause . i 'll be trying to earn that 11th free ice cream !
0	looking for a fast and reasonably good lunch option around desert inn and eastern ? lindo should make your short list . they have reasonably priced lunch specials and they are slightly overstaffed which helps to get you in and out pretty fast if you need to get on with your day . i 've had my share of experiences with lindo ... look at my previous reviews , it 's a love - hate thing . they 've messed up my orders . they ca n't seem to refill the salsa and sometimes the chips . and no not everyone wants fried fish tacos . but sometimes none of that crap matters . you go in and do n't have to wait forever to be seated . and you 'll do n't pay out the nose for what you get . sometimes ... that 's all you need . back up to 3 stars ... and removed from a special list .
0	they have a grill for those steaks that u are craving for . typical ham and roast beef ! it was good for the price and for my boys who are at that age they ca n't stop eating .
0	not wanting to complain but beware . our soup was brought to the table lukewarm . our orders were to have white or steamed rice with our meal it came instead with brown rice . when they brought the fried noodles and the sweet-and-sour sauce , the sauce was watered down . certainly much runnier then any sauce i 've had any other chinese restaurant . my wife loves chinese food and steamed rice and she found this place to be horrible .
1	delicious food and drink . great atmosphere . love it .
0	came here for dinner . i had their special basil w chicken and vegetables . it was good but not amazing . we also got the shrimp spring rolls . these were very good . i got my husband the drunken noodles and he did not like it at all . i do n't want to judge off of one experience so i 'll go back and try different items on the menu . i 'm hoping other items will b better because i love thai food .
0	love the concept of pilates meets yoga in the 90 minute class ! i workout often but this class gave me a good sore all over . a couple negatives ... i rented a mat and it kind of smelled bad . there was no music during the regular yoga class and i prefer tunes to go with my poses .
0	two stars because i 'm on vacation and am extra laid back , otherwise the $ 70 dollar bill , not worth my hard earned dinero ! food is less than good , and the service ridiculous ! the food came like 10 minutes after we ordered , which felt more like sbarro 's than a restaurant ... they charge $ 8 for 12oz . blue ribbon draft beer ... really ! ? the waitress came to take our order and assumed ( spanish people ) only knew fettucine alfredo and said she could work with any pasta dish ordered al fettucine ... the pasta dishes , not fettucine , we had were not cooked al dente but half way unboiled ... at the end i had my zumanity tickets upside down on the table , when she just grabbed them and said `` where you guys going ? '' and then `` oh you already saw the show '' ... terrible ! i could go on and on , but you get the point ... il fornaio -no thanks !
1	we organized a bachlorette party here and we had two major issues . one the pre-fix menu and two the caviar bar seating . although most of my friends are rail thin , they can eat . the menu included a taste of caviar , a garden salad and a petite filet . the dessert was an ice cream cone . well , since the filet was more petite than we imagined , most of us were hungry ... we all laughed and said that we should of ordered the bachelor party menu ( heh heh ) . the other thing we had issue with was the bar seating . i was sitting at one end and the bride to be was sitting at the other . i do n't think we shared one word the entire dinner . in hind sight , we would have just made reservations for seven and had whatever we wanted ... i would have ranked this a three , but the trendy atmosphere and the free admission to rain was worth the extra star .
0	decent hotel . nice people . rooms are good . restaurant food & service is good . but the wifi is impossibly slow in the bedrooms . hilton has a wifi upgrade that you pay are supposed to pay for . the keep the so-called complementary wifi annoyingly slow . as a business traveler these days you need wifi and i will not stay at hotels that make you pay for wifi .
1	i love this bar , it 's my favorite in vegas . the vibe is laid back and the music is never too loud . i love the art on the walls , the fresh flower arrangements and the eclectic furniture . christina and pam have excellent taste and have made this bar a really special place to hang out . the cocktails are tasty and the staff is always friendly ! try the burning bush , it 's smokey and delicious !
0	this gyms okay , lots of machines friendly staff , parking is n't a big issue but it tends to get packed .... most likely because it 's the new year . you ca n't go wrong with there pricing . i guess if your gon na work out go really early in the morning or late at night
1	not bad .. really clean . great desserts . liked it over most buffets in vegas .
0	this amsterdam owned bar on 16th st and thomas does it right as a neighborhood gay bar . the overall vibe at this place is that it 's a place for friends and couples to just hang out , chill , maybe play pool , and enjoy a few inexpensive drinks . no one here acts like a diva or the next stripper act . it 's a small space , with one bar that accessible both inside and outside on the patio . there 's a jukebox altho they do play music , it 's kinda dark in some corner and the bathrooms are tiny . no cover and parking gets limited at times . it 's a good place just for drinks , but you still need to head over to amsterdam or charlies if you wan na dance coz this is n't the place for that .
0	if you 're in need of specialty sized shoes , i 'd suggest going elsewhere . husband and i came here thinking it would be a good place to try and fit his fred flintstone sized feet ( he wears quadruple e wide shoes , so yeah ) . they did n't have the size stocked that we needed , but they said that they could order them , no problem . they had us pre-pay for the shoes and shipping ( which was fine at the time ) , but then , 2 weeks later they called us and told us they could n't get the shoes we needed . 2 weeks ! and they could n't refund us the money back to our card over the phone and did n't offer any alternatives , so i had to go back to the store for a refund - so we were sans shoes for 2 weeks , and then we had to go look all over again ! not cool . i 'm sure for hardcore runners and people with regular sized feet , this place is the jam , but for the casual runner and large-footed people , it 's a no-go .
1	in arizona some b & ) tchen bbq ! ! ! ! saw the place on the fwy and jumped off to find the place ... place if huge ! if u mis this place please get ur eyes checked ! lol first impression was people leaving and telling us how good it was .. two different parties ! man a place that makes people do that ! we all ordered the sampler platter .. three choices of meet and one side .. i ordered ribs , brisket and pulled pork .. pulled pork cooks for 12+hrs .. was good just a little to mushy for me .. brisket was over the top for me ! yummy ! ! now the ribs .. i have traveled all over for ribs and this is hands down my favorite ! my side was mac and cheese as a recommendation and i have only had one better than this ! i heard people taking about the potatoes behind us and how good they were ... oh yes did i forget to mention the corn bread ! look do n't hesitate to come here ! your palette and ur stomach will love it !
1	enjoying an amazing birthday dinner with family and friends ... with a sushi feast to make the gods green with jealousy !
1	i love this place ! the staff is amazing and the classes are fun and challenging . i 've been hooked since the first class i took . the teachers are really helpful and knowledgeable , whether you are taking a ballet or fitness class . i like the variety of classes and that every teacher has their own style they add to each class . so no matter what class i am taking its different every time . i definitely see a positive change in my body , balance , and flexibility . i was able to rekindle my love of dance after joining this studio . i had n't danced in 13 years and was really missing it , but unable to find an adult only studio to attend . so with ballet fusion fitness i am getting the best of both worlds that i enjoy ... dance and fitness . its well worth the money and i could n't be happier .
0	my best friend bought her gorgeous wedding dress here . i was n't able to be there the weekend she went dress shopping so when i came in town this weekend for her birthday she wanted to take me there so she could try it on for me . it was a saturday and we were n't sure id they 'd be busy so we called to see if they could go ahead and pull it so it would be ready for her to try on once we arrived . after calling three times , someone finally answered the phone and said sure that 'd be no problem . once we got there no one greeted us , so we walked to the desk where two people were sitting doing absolutely nothing ( one was eating ) . even then neither said a word ! so i spoke to tell them w had called etc and while i was explaining another employee walked by and heard me talking and asked if we called , i said yes , and she said yeh we have the dress back here , pulled , waiting for you . great ! so she takes my friend back and i sit in a chair to wait to see her in her gown . well the lady leaves , so i have to go back and help her zip her dress , uhhh , that was a little crazy to me . i zip it , go back to the chair so i can see her walk out . she looked gorgeous in it . i asked her about veils and had she tried any on and she said no , so again i tracked someone down to help us with veils . she brings us two and then leaves . they also sale bridesmaid dresses so we went to look at those bc shes back and forth about the color scheme she wants . no one comes to offer help with that either . theres another employee over there literally just straightening out the dresses , does she ask if we need any help ? no ! we grabbed a couple just to see the color next to the brides dress , struggling to take pictures while holding dresses up , any help ? nope . my gf told me they 've had bad customer service throughout her entire process . she said every time they say they 're going to call when somethings done , they dont . she leaves messages bc they never answer their phone and they dont call her back . and i got to see first hand how horrible it was . she , nor any of her bridesmaids will be giving them another penny . horrible customer service . this is a bridal boutique , soon to be brides should be doted on and made to feel special , not ignored .
1	this is a nice mom & pop caf\u00e9 with a personable staff always willing to help accommodate customers . owner comes to see if there is anything he can do to make your visit a good one . prices are reasonable . cheerful and happy staff ! always meets you with a smile . omelets are huge !
0	this place has improved some but is still pretty bad . the staff was horrible prior to the move from green valley to the new location on horizon ridge . they have hired a nice receptionist , young brunette , to take over for the bad attitude asian one , they put her in the back . i always saw a nurse . it took 2 yrs of going here before i finally saw dr. nancy long . the dr. seemed nice but was n't helpful stating i needed surgery after seeing me once . i refuse to see the nurse robin anymore . robin is mean & unprofessional . robin opened the exam room door while i was in stir ups to have a conversation & made rude comments to me about my medical history . the other nurse cindy is caring & helpful . the same experience pregnant or not . oh yeah & expect to wait for hours .
0	where or where to begin , i 've been living at villas for about 4 months now . upon moving in my air conditioner did not work , the stove would n't turn on , a light bulb was out in the bathroom and i still can get the light switches to work in the bedroom and living room . in my opinion this should have all been taken care of before a new tenant moves in . if you love noise and can sleep through anything sure go ahead move in , but if not beware . the walls are paper thin , and i swear if i did n't know better if think the windows were open 24hrs . you hear everything ! ! ! oh and im sure you 'll just love the sound of a leaf blower at 6am ! ! ! being on the bottom floor is the worst my upstairs neighbors must be having the olympics going on with all the banging i hear . there is also a major bug infestation , the complex charges a monthly pest control fee which is just a waist . i 've had 2 scorpions in my kitchen , a mouse that ran across my patio while i was outside , a couple roaches out by my front door , pincher bugs consistently in my bathroom and kitchen oh and last but not least the crickets ! ! ! ! they are everywhere ! ! ! ! ! once it gets dark those little puppies are out and about , god forbid you get to enjoy a nice evening on your patio , even a walk to the mailbox or trash they are jumping on you , so be prepared to make a run for it and get inside fast ! to have the pest control spray in your apartment you must submit a request , i 've requested this 3 times , still waiting for them to come . after i called and complained about all the insects i was told `` well this is just there habitat '' uh no , i 'm sorry but my apartment is not there nesting ground . i previously lived across the street at vista suereno and never had any problems with bugs or noise and that 's right next to a huge feild so i have no clue what management is trying to pull . i highly suggest looking at different places i 'm the area and avoid this complex at all cost !
0	just ok ....
0	donuts are really good , if they have any when you get there ! ! ! went in on a tuesday morning at 1030 , and they only had a total of 10 donuts . drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at dunkin donuts . very disappointed ! !
0	just barely sat in , at least 10 servers and was not helped out for a long time . finally got my order in and staff is not happy at all . will most likely be the last time i come here .
0	this place sounded promising from the yelp reviews . so we gave it a shot . we ordered take out and it was ready in 15 minutes . we ordered : house lo mein general tso 's chicken egg rolls crab puffs everything was just ok. the flavors were good but nothing made me want to come back . the general tso 's chicken was pretty spicy and a good flavor but a little bland . i was left wanting more flavor . the house lomein was good as well but a little bland . the meat was cooked well and tasted good . the egg rolls had good flavor but were a little soggy on the inside . crab puffs were ok as well . everything was just 'ok ' . i would n't go back here . i would choose wong 's jr over this place . good china is just that -- good , not great . if you 're in this area and you 're looking for chinese , go to wong 's jr .
1	our favourite japanese rest in our neighbourhood . small place . nice sushi and sash ini selection . i enjoyed udon noodles there last time i went ... but the tempura was a bit on the soggy side .
0	.... and boy are my arms tired ! comedy clubs are easy to review when focusing on the club itself , and not the talent . you could be in the perfect comedy club and see a horrible act , just as you could see something amazing at a dive bar 's open mic night . this `` club '' is really a conference room that has been converted into a comedy club . the staff sets up chairs around the room for the patrons the night of the show , adding seats when needed . there are a few vip couches , but since this intimate setting is quite quaint , there really is no reason to pay the high price for them . there are two waitresses who run around frantically trying to fill all the patrons ' orders , but be ready to wait for your beverage . walking up to the bar in the room is usually a better way to go . i saw the late ( 9pm ) show on a saturday night . seating starts at 8:30 , so get there early if you want to sit in the front . really , there is n't a horrible seat in the house though . i saw todd paul the night i went in , and laughed my a $ $ off . he was charismatic and hilarious . his act was a mix of magic , stunts , and comedy . he did an amazing job of making fun of las vegas shows , specifically magic shows . i would definitely return for another fun night .
1	great neighborhood place that serves delicious food late into the night . first room has a bar and a few tables ... through there is a second room all for dining with a window view to the street . unpretentious , authentic , tasty italian . sea scallops were perfect .
0	i am a family of 3 , mom , dad , and a 3 year old . we both work full time jobs and are full time students , we 're not paying $ 60+ just to go to a `` real '' theater . yes , the theater was full of kids but they were all behaved . we did n't have any problems with talking or disruption during the movie . the audio and picture were both fine as well . we had a very enjoyable experience our first time here . however , we did n't eat anything , we did n't use the child booster seats or use the bathroom ( that was a little questionable ) and i carried around a pocket sized hand sanitizer . i understand it 's cheap but they could still keep the place a little cleaner . they did make me open my purse to see if we had brought any outside food in , but they just glanced into it , it was n't harassing at all . basically , you get what you pay for . so , i 'm not complaining . we 'll still return : )
1	went there for lunch last friday with my wife sat outside good atmosphere , flat bread was great ! ! the app 's were good as well . i 'll try it again
0	this seems to be a sweet small pub in the heart of marchmont , but unfortunately is really too small for anything . there is a good selection of beer and the staff are friendly but you ca n't escape the feeling that everyone else can hear everything you are saying . in summer it is a bit better , as they have a few seats outside , but due to the nature of the pavement , there is not a lot of space for many . the biggest disappointment is that they have a downstairs area that would add considerable space to the pub if it were used , and did n't remain constantly with the lights off . however they do show all the big football games , and as there are few pubs in marchmont to choose from , this is a good bonus .
1	really good whiskey and beer selection to choose from along with a unique menu . definitely try the smokestack cocktail if you like smokey flavors and an awesome experience service was good and environment was just what you would expect from a public house ! do n't miss if you are in the area !
0	dog owner beware ! ! ! ! do not take your dog here ! ! ! we took our two dogs here and when we picked them up they were butchered ! ! ! we have a maltese and a lhasa apso , we asked for a teddy bear cut and not to cut my lhasa 's goatee . we got them back and they were shaved down like a five year old had done it . my lhasa looked like a giant rat ! the lady was very rude . she is cheap , but you get what you pay for . do not go here . dog owner beware ! ! !
0	food : food was good , not great . price : more expensive than other restaurants i 've been to . service : the guy who took my order ( take out ) seemed too serious and uptight , but the woman who gave me my order was friendly . overall , would not come back .
0	this place sucks ; worst customer service ever ! then if you 're with a group of friends you ca n't split the bill , also they do n't really close at the time listed on the door , they close more than half hour before the closing time listed . servers are so rude too ; worst place ever .
0	july 29 , 2011 == noticed the restaurant 's sign is gone -- definitely should call before trying to arrange a gathering here !
0	when i went to the website to become a `` wino '' i was expecting to sample some of the better street wines such night train , thunderbird , md 20/20 and cisco . to my disappointment we toured vineyards and sampled wine costing over $ 20 a bottle and we did not even get to take a nap under any bridge in phoenix , az . waste of time and money and over 1/2th of my welfare check
0	the burgers were okay . they were a little bit on the drier side . the burgers are a pretty good size . you can get a burger combo , with a side and alcoholic shake . the shake was pretty good . all in all , the burger is n't anything crazy special , there are better burger places on the strip .
0	incredibly rude service from andrea on sept. 13. clearly annoyed i was `` interrupting her '' to make my purchase . i will not use this location ever again .
0	awful . stay in your car and it would be better . worst customer service i have ever encountered in my life ! ! ! are you joking me . i have never complained about to a manager about an employee in my life , but the check out was awful . long story short my ipod got ruined cuase of the flood damage in my room . they were great about reimbursing me , and the security guard ( dane or dean ? ) was awesome . super helpful and friendly and took care of everything . i ended up getting my money for the ipod which was awesome also they ended up giving me cash that day , but the condescending awful bad word that worked the front desk should get fired , and i have never felt that way before ever . i wo n't even mention her name even though i really want to . but it was terrible , so terrible i had to write this bad of a review . i would n't give them business if they offered me a free room . never again
0	ick . surprised this location has not been closed . there is seldom anyone there , the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in . attention health dept , time for a spot check .
1	came here for an anniversary as it was one of the top 10 zagat rated spots a few years ago . while the food quality did meet the price mark , i was sort of disappointed with the ravioli and oysters . we got a 1 foot long dish with 3 oysters on it . 3 is not divisible by two . so , they could add one more and make everyone happy . however , the cocktails and the wine selection were good and the food was definitely savory . service was great as well . come well dressed or you will look bad .
0	if you 're in oakland with friends who are divided on drinking vs. eating , fuel and fuddle is a good compromise : big beer selection to satisfy the drinkers , and plenty of food options to keep the eaters happy . the portions here are really generous . while not listed directly on the menu , you can request a side of just sweet potato fries ( instead of the mix of regular and sweet potato fries ) , and the plate you get is huge . the pizzas here are pretty good , with thin crusts that are nicely chewy . the dessert portions here are the largest i 've ever seen -- the brownie is about three or four times larger than the typical bar brownie and the nutter butter pie is the tallest peanut butter pie i 've seen . i like how fuel and fuddle tried to put its own twist on the apple turnover with the apple `` burnover '' by using pizza dough instead of puff pastry . the dough itself , however , could have been more sweet -- even with warm apple filling inside , the chocolate sauce drizzled on top , and the vanilla ice cream , i felt the dessert lacked something . as other reviewers have said , this is n't a place to go to if you want to have conversations . in a party of six , i had to stick to talking to the people right next to me , and even then i felt like i was nearly shouting . the food and drinks here are n't bad at all , but not quite enough to convince me to frequent this place if i 'm not already in oakland .
1	was here today the food the service was great left feeling full and complete a lot of bang for your buck
1	we ate really well when we were in charlotte and this place was no exception . since it was connected to our hotel , we had lunch and dinner here and i was really impressed with both meals . for lunch i had the `` banh moon , '' clearly a play on a banh mi , which was really good , which was served with my current obsession - sweet potato fries . for breakfast , trying to be healthy , i had oatmeal . now , i 've never raved about oatmeal in restaurants . i usually regret the choice because its boring and everyone else 's food is better . this oatmeal was really good ( though they gave me enough to feed 5 people ) . it was served with apples that had been sauteed in a light butter sauce , which added a really unique punch to the oatmeal . i 'm pretty sure that i only ate a fourth of what was served , but it was very filling - super useful because the deposition went through lunch and i did n't get to eat again until we got to the airport at about 7pm . all in all , i was really impressed with the menu and the quality of the meals .
0	not bad . we had a large party so we got take out . the dudes helping us at the counter were n't very friendly . kind of a cold shoulder feel . it was our first time , like probably many others , but did n't offer any expertise . i got the smoked meat sandwich and nothing else as some of my other buddies got frites and cole slaw . i stood outside and ate my sandwich . it was n't bad , but it was n't langers or katz pastrami . it is cheaper at like 7 dollars and they do n't skimp on the meat . i just was n't amazed . if you want it to taste better though ... add cole slaw into the sandwich . it adds a lot of depth . the acidity and crunchy texture of the coleslaw complements the softness of the bread and saltiness of the smoked meat . i actually enjoyed my sandwich a lot more after the addition of cole slaw .
0	an extremely disappointing visit for me and i wo n't be back . this is quite sad for me as this little hidden gem is really beautiful inside , light and airy with tasteful decoration . i was here with a few work colleagues for lunch and upon arrival , bread and butter was placed on the table . i asked the waiter if there was any flora or suchlike - his nostrils flared , his mouth pursed as he told me with disgust that there was not . fine , but when a customer has explained a lactose allergy then it would be nice to try and accommodate that ? this set the pace for the rest of the meal . there was almost nothing on the menu that i could eat . everyone else dining with me seemed quite happy with their food though so if you have no weird dietary requirements then give it a bash .
1	a little hole-in-the-wall kind of gem that has delicious eats . i was in the mood for some serious grub that would n't break my bank , and thanks to yelp , i stumbled upon this place with 4-stars and one dollar sign . perfect . it lived up to my expectations ! i ordered the chizona hot dog and homemade french fries . this is the kind of hot dog that you need to order as is , chicago style , with all the yummy fixings to make it great . the french fries are really good , crispy , crunchy , and they give you a large portion . my boyfriend got the italian beef sandwich and he was very happy with his order . it was a giant sandwich so he ended up taking half of it home . luckily , he is moving closer to chizona so i have a feeling we will be eating there quite often . we both left full and happy for less than $ 20 altogether ! excited to try their pizza and chicken tenders !
0	i was at this airport for a few mins as i connected . would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at lax was delayed for no reason .
0	we will see if i upgrade my review depending on whether i hear from management in the next few days . we were staying here because my friend works the fashion shows that are happening this week . the rooms at mandalay were huge , and the beds were comfy . the pillows were terrible , but that 's to be expected from hotels . we had a good time exploring and visiting the shark tank , even though it was 18 $ per person . however on our way to leave the hotel on sunday , we realized that our tired had been slashed in the mandalay parking garage . we notified security , who seemed unconcerned and told us to go back to our car and wait for someone . the person who helped us was amazing and really helpful about what to do next . we were not the only car whose tires got slashed . the car 2 spaces from us did as well , and we heard that cars at the luxor also experienced the same thing . we called aaa , and then called tire stores frantically trying to find new tires on a sunday . luckily we finally found a place that had them , but we ended up having to pay 300 $ for 2 new tires and wait 3.5-4 hours to sort out the ordeal . the mandalay has a camera on the garage , and it was very close to our car , so i '' m a little surprised that they took no responsibility for what happened . when i called the front desk to talk about it , i was told that we would have to wait for `` risk management '' to call us back . we have yet to hear anything , and plan to call them today . i find it really ridiculous that after staying here for 2 nights and spending tons of money on things at their casino , they still seem unconcerned that our car got vandalized . there are lots of nice hotels in vegas , and if i knew that mandalay did n't care about its patron 's property , i likely would have stayed elsewhere . if risk management chooses to do the right thing and cover some of our expenses , i will happily amend this review , because the rest of our experience was really positive . but overall its just not worth the stress and money of having your property vandalized .
1	excellent very fresh sushi ! great crowd and worth the little wait . i am visiting from los angeles and this restaurant is as good as many in la , nyc & sfo
0	i was soo wanting to like this place ... hottie boyfriend came home one night and said `` hey , i saw this cool wine bar on mill that did n't play techno music or look too pretentious ... '' sweet i thought so we went a few days later . only a few tables were taken late on a saturday night , we were in luck ( so we thought ) . waitress was decent but did n't enlighten us as to the fact that they had flights of wine . fortunately i did not experience the `` dude '' guy i 've read about in other posts but i do n't doubt he 's alive and well there . let 's fast forward with the server/patron banter so i can save you the agony ... we tried a chilean wine that was amazingly dark , thick , and chocolatey . the bruschetta got us hook line and sinker with all the amazing flavor combos like fig-prosciutto-marscarpone ... but i thought bruschetta was toasted bread ? maybe it 's like the wendy 's breakfast commercial and panini really does mean eggy-bacon-boat ... but i digress . so we got the bruschetta and i wanted to pretend like i was 9 and scrape of the toppings and not eat the stale un-toasted bread . but wait - the final piece was toasted and actually warm ... and it was n't that bad . i really wanted to like this place - it 's a perfect people watching spot on mill ( itself worth the price of a glass of wine ) . we had a good time despite the food but i 'm not sure i can get into cold untoasted bruschetta , no matter how hard they try to dazzle you with fancy schmancy topping-bling .
0	my last trip here was very disappointing . where to begin ? it took a while for our server to show up . interesting side note : while waiting for our server we could n't help but notice out of the 24 patrons in the restaurant 23 were female lol ! the happy hour menu was okay but nothing too spectacular , select wines $ 5 or $ 7 dollars , select cocktails were i think $ 5 , and some discounted apps , bruschetta $ 3 . we ordered two cocktails and a bruschetta . they did n't have the cucumber for the drink i selected so i had them modify it with raspberries ... did n't have that either . anyway i ended up with an interesting gin drink , which worked because i was very thirsty at that point . the bruschetta that was supposed to come out of the brick oven looked good but was cold . i mean it was cooked in a brick oven , somebody probably changed their mind or whatever ; it was then put it in a fridge to preserve it and failed to heat it up again , which was then served to us cold . at that point we decided not to have dinner here and left to go somewhere else . i am very disappointed , i loved this place when it opened !
1	so impressed . beyond impressed . beyond in love with this place . i 'll say it over and over again . i really appreciate when business owners put the time and thought , not only into their product , but also their aesthetic . the place is gorgeous ! all wood and brick , it has a rustic , yet cozy feel . they have so much space , it 's exciting to think about what will be possible here . but onto the beers ... they are delicious ! it 's rare that i try all the beers on tap and like them ... all ! but i do ! i first feel in love with their white sky , which is a chai beer . yep , you heard me right , chai beer ! if yinz know me , you know i love my chai tea , so this is perfect for me . they even make their own chai spice blend to put into the beer . totally impressive ! i also really liked the build and destroy wheat stout and the business casual red ale . these dudes are young , but smart , and i 'm so excited to see what they 'll be up to . plus , i 'm excited to drink all the beer . that is all .
0	owner was super nice ... he talked to me about how he started the store ... what a few of his inspirations were for the cupcakes ... i ended up with one elvis cupcake and a whoopie pie ... i have to say that the elvis cupcake model is popping up everywhere and i 'm sad to say that this one was one of my least favorite ... something about the frosting was really offputting to me ... and the whoopie pie was ok ... but maybe i was just expecting more out of it ... i think i would have loved the whoopie pie if it had a baby with an ice cream sandwich ... something like an ice cream whoopie ... i did n't care for the filling ( which was similar to the cupcake frosting in consistency ) ... but since the owner was so nice ... and i really liked his message ... i realize although i did n't like the pastries ... that 's not to say that they are n't someone else 's cup of tea ! the shop is adorable though
0	it 's closed ! thank goodness ! i was hear once with some girl friends and a couple of guys started chatting us up . during the conversation one of them started to look really ill , they were both obviously drunk , and before we knew it the ill-looking one was vomiting in the corner of our table . it was disgusting . we immediately notified the bartender who then mopped up the vomit with a dirty looking rag and declared the table good as new for incoming patrons . needless to say , we warned the next people who attempted to sit there .
0	the staffs was rude and management does n't seem to care . i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .

1	we have eaten at montesano 's a few times , but always from their pasta menu and never the pizza . so with that in mind ... the review . there is no shortage of italian restaurants anywhere in lv/henderson and the styles and flavors are endless . and like most food , everyone has their favorite , and their 5-star pick may be someone elses 2 star . such is food , particularly ethnic food . heck , we have even been to italy for a few weeks and considered that to be some of the worst italian food we had ever had ... so go figure . anyway , the food that we have had here is pretty damn good . maybe not the 'best i have had anywhere ' , but very good nonetheless . the last time there , had the spag and meatballs . the balls were huge and plenty of pasta , although the sauce was a little light , but they happily brought more . my wife went for the raviolis with a different sauce than mine , and it was great too . the restaurant was very casual , which is exactly how i like it . do n't shove tablecloths-candles-etc in front of me -- -i am there to eat . and that is what i did , and we willl be back .
1	i just picked up my favorite pair of old boots from j r 's shoe repair . wow ! ! ! i am soo happy ! these boots were purchased about 6 years ago at kohl 's . they are not leather . they are black with a chunky platform heel and i love them . they look great with dress pants and jeans . after the years of wear and tear ( abuse ) and playing freeze tag & baseball in them , the heels were lopsided , the soles were wasted . i searched high and low for a replacement and could not find another pair that i liked as much . i brought them into j r 's shoe repair since it is in my neighborhood and was told they could be fixed and they would even clean them up . i have new soles and heels ! they look like brand new boots ! quality work and very reasonably priced . i am over the moon and j r 's shoe repair has my business ! thanks !
0	one of the few gas stations and convenience stores near the las vegas strip , we fill up on gas here before heading back home . the gas station portion of this place is an arco , which means that if you want to pay at the pump , you have to use your debit card . credit cards wo n't work at the pump . the lanes are very tight here and it gets very busy at times . the location is convenient though , so it 's worth the hassle . return factor - 80 %
0	visited this place on a night when they had some bands . had a very difficult time getting attention of wait staff . finally walked up to the bar and ordered two draft beers which ended up being close to 10 bucks . several people - including us - tried to flag down a server and finally after about 40 minutes our orders were finished . the appetizer ( an italian burrito ? ) was served to us still frozen inside . soups were nothing special . ribs were pretty good but unless you like lots of sauce , ask for it on the side . bands were very good on this night . i ended up only drinking three drinks that night because that seemed to be all they wanted to sell me . could n't seem to get anyone 's attention for more . seems like if you are going to pay a band you want to sell the food and drinks a little better .
1	always a fan of outlets - especially when they carry name branded stores . tory burch , lacoste , nike factory , etc . it was really crowded when we went - given it was st. patrick 's day . first time here though . next time we 're going to explore the south one .
0	my husband and i were excited when modern grove opened , we live near by . we 've been there 3 times . # 1 beers are not cold . # 2 service is slow and often have to look for your server # 3 wait time for food seems a little too long . we have always been able to get a seat without having to wait . we have been disappointed with them . we will not go back until we have heard better reviews . i hope the management looks at these reviews and attempts to make changes .
1	the pleasance is one of the university of edinburgh 's most used buildings , and the bar in the downstairs area is well worth mentioning . typically a student haunt , it provides all that you would expect from a bar of this type . it also provides food , and shows a variety of sport on its tv screens . seating is in comfortable booths , with padded seating and small dividing walls that segregate the bar area , so that it can be full of people without feeling that way . drinks are reasonably priced , and the food is typically student in style . fajitas , nachos and burgers dominate the menu , and having tried most of them , i can confirm that they are very tasty , and worth their cheap prices . i have typically been here on a quieter weekday evening during term time , during which the atmosphere is relaxed . however , as with most bars , when there is a big sporting occasion , a show in the pleasance theatre , or just during freshers ' week , the bar will be a lot busier . give the pleasance bar a go if you want some cheap student grub , or a relaxed drink with friends .
1	if you do n't like rock-n-roll fingers , i do n't like you . period . the owner rocked , he used to hook us up with an extra finger all the time ! ! for all the shitty food in arizona i had to endure with , this place was a shining star ! living back in new york , if i am ever cravin some chicken fingers , i know my hunger will not be succesully taken care of b/c their is no rock-n-roll substitute .
0	well they may live up to its `` greasy '' name but they also have some surprises up their sleeves . for example , they also have salads and chicken sandwiches besides tasty looking burgers and milkshakes ! on my first visit , i enjoyed the big kahuna chicken sandwich which is their take on the teriyaki chicken sandwich and i used all the will power i had to not order the fries to go with it . instead i went with the side salad . i sat on the funky patio and enjoyed taking in the old gas station scenery such as gas pumps . i also noticed a sand volleyball court in the back and it looks like they do volleyball games and activities on occasion . the meal came out fast , by the server with a huge smile on her face . the chicken sandwich was juicy and tender and the sauce on it was pretty flavorful . i was surprised that it was a creamy-based teriyaki sauce which turned out to be pretty tasty and the grilled pineapples were the perfect touch . the food was decent but nothing that i 'd say is a `` must-try '' but the atmosphere and decor has a lot of character . all in all , it 's a nice spot to visit for a casual meal during a day in cave creek . next time i visit , i 'll try the kobe burger and a milkshake , but for my first visit , i can definitely confirm that i 'd visit this greasy eatery again .
0	i am so sad to say this is the worst customer service place ever . i went there a couple of times when they were on dunlap and they were always cold and very unfriendly . i do not know why they were so cold . they did not say hi to me and they said hello to my husband when he walked in way after me because he was parking the car , i told my husband to stop there to see what they had . it was my idea . i walked in smiling and made eye contact by nothing . i wanted to spend money there . they greeted and welcomed my husband but not me ? i was dressed well . the only difference was is my husband is not hispanic . the last three times i was there it happened each time . i walked out and will not go there again . sad .
0	d-i-r-t-y . and dark . they run hand in hand . seriously . great concept and all , but bring your own lysol , purel , and vacuum if possible . service was pretty quick .
1	for my 200th review i am choosing brio tuscan grille . first let me say that it is a beautiful building , looks just like a villa in italy to me . the colors are just what they should be . inside is beautifully decorated , and wonderful music is always playing . the restrooms are very clean and nice . we were seated at a corner tablefor 4 , it was perfect . the nice thing is the have a waist high wall built around it , so even though you are on the corner you are not bothered . it is really a relaxing setting . i enjoyed lunch very much . i have had their food before , because they have catered a few events i have been lucky enough to go to . always good ! our waiter was demetrius , he was very good , until he got busy , then he was a little frazzled . he gave us the wrong check twice , but things happen and it was the day after christmas . so it was very busy . the food was wonderful as always . t got the crab cakes and italian wedding soup , delish ! i got chicken with pasta and lobster bisque . outstanding ! ! ! we will be back , i wish we could go again this week . lots of parking in the great free parking garage . the more i come over here , the more i like it ! oh and do not forget to get your reward card.every time you come in you get points for dining here . which adds up to free food .
0	it 's the bare minimum that you would expect from starbucks . i have never been able ti order a breakfast sandwich because they always run out before 10am . when asked how many sandwiches they usually carry the lady told me only 7 ! no wonder they always run out . they are only good for making you a drink at a mediocre pace . and do n't expect much from these baristas , they have a sense of entitlement to the place that subtly overwhelms the customer service . handle the stress ladies , its just a coffee shop .
0	this was my home gym for a while . until they switched up management . the place has fallen apart . manager is rude . machines are old . it 's simply not kept up anymore . sad because it was such a great gym , people were serious about working out there . if you live in the nw area take your money to lvac over the bridge , there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner .
0	this was my first time here and i really wanted to know if this place lived up to the hype . we all know gordon and how he acts on his show , so you 'd think this place would be just flat out amazing . my order : damnation chicken burger truffle parmesan fries corona presentation of the food looks great . i think more went into that than the taste . nothing about this chicken burgr stood out except it was over grilled . i was not impressed by this at all . the fries were nothing special either . they seemed to be normal steak fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled on them . the truffles were in one of the dipping sauces . again just did n't live up to the hype . the corona was probably the only thing that came out meeting my expectation . i placed the order on the ipad that was given to me and it did n't even get sent to the bar . the waiter came over and just took it and read it . my thoughts are it works if you want customized cocktails , but not for beers . i thought for sure it would be like stacked ( customized burger place in los angeles ) . overall not that wowed by this place and it was a bit over priced . aside from watching a game on the screens , and grabbing a drink or two , i would skip this place and probably any other gr place .
1	forget this is bobby flay 's restaruant -- it 's great ! our large 13 person party enjoyed a 3-hour lunch , simply decadent and never feeling rushed . although the food was spectacular , our server was the highlight of the meal . she was very knowledgeable and involved , selecting excellent spanish wines to pair with the food and offering suggestions for dessert and side dishes .
0	have been for late dinner , and happy hour appetizers . both good , but only good . which is good ! ! italian is top quality for las vegas , but with a club inside the restaurant it becomes tough to take serious as a top quality restaurant . the appetizers are great , cocktails are decent . if you want vegas flare , it is one of the top places that cater to people who need both liquid and solid . definitely worthy !
0	ok so i 've been to a few concerts here .... one thing i do n't like . grey goose rocks .... 12 dollars . yea .... plastic ware and vodka ... eh .... just put me in the backyard of jorge lugo 's house - have his mom make tamales , and kool aid in the plastic container . yea that is just not classy . one thing that sucks ... it 's downstairs . so if you do n't take the elevator . people are bottlenecked and herded in . 2nd sucky thing . kids are smelly .... boys especially . so going to a rock concert . gross ... smelly .... sweaty ... boys ... who think they 're hard core and they like to mosh . one thing about me .... i 'm a tank . myke smash . yea i rock out . but i would rather you not smash your face onto my fist . it 's just weird . overall - it 's ok - i 've been here when it was great . but i 've been to some hot smelly crappy concerts here too . i got ta knock it for drink prices and presentation . i also knock it for having cheap concerts that attract hooligans and hoodrats with their shenanigans .... whoa ... that 's the whitest i 've sounded all day ....
1	very good food . great flavors and amazing bread . very friendly staff too
0	all it takes is bad attitude and the unwillingness to be flexible for your customers to turn a good experience into a bad one very , very quickly . unfortunately , this happened at 360 physical therapy , who i was ready to write a pretty stellar review for , based on pt service alone . i liked my therapist on the whole , and i 've felt like i was taken decent care of . however , the practice has a rather draconian appointment-cancellation fee . it does n't seem to matter that i have paid them countless $ 35.00 co-pays ( ludicrous and laughable , i know ... but that 's between me and my wicked insurance provider ) and that i call them if i i 'm so much as stuck at a traffic light and will be five minutes late ... we are battling to the death over an alleged no-show appointment that i swear upwards and down i rescheduled prior to not attending . the billing manager will not let it go , and insists that i must pay this fee , no matter how many conversations we have about it . the point here is , folks : is n't it worth it to keep your customers happy ? i know i did n't miss this appointment ... but even if i did , i had countless sessions at this facility . i was always on time , and i always paid at the time of service . i was a `` good customer . '' and i would be going back , and recommending my friends , if it was n't for the fact that they are unwilling to let something so small go . unfortunate , i think .
1	this is in my parents ' 'hood and after they made me sign up for a players ' club card , $ 6.99 will get you the lunch buffet . during the slow summer months , it is even cheaper , $ 4.99 . if a small town feel could be possible in a cavernous casino , it is achieved here because the service is absolutely polite , very friendly and fantastic . our drinks were refilled and our dirty plates taken away promptly , and the seater even came by later in the meal to ask if things were ok , which they definitely were ! the food is on par with buffets , but i found myself eating a lot because everyone was so nice here : )
1	this buffalo wild wings is laid out much more nicely than some of the others i 've been to . tvs everywhere , including right over your tables , and good lighting so you can actually see your food . and the wings , of course , are delicious .
0	i took my 10 year old niece to get our finger and toenails painted as a reward for her completion of school . i made an appointment in advance . i let them know that we would come in with clean nails ready to be painted , that we did n't want clippers , files , etc . just your basic polish and go . when we arrived , the receptionist took us back to a manicurist station and painted my niece 's nails in about 4 minutes , and then grabbed her feet from under the table and painted them . i asked if she would let my niece move to the pedicure chair so she could have the `` experience '' of getting a massage and having her toes painted , i.e . to feel like a big girl . she flat out told me `` no . '' i 'm not confrontational or anything , but i did question why not since we : a ) made an appointment ; and b ) there were 5-6 open chairs . she just told me that other appointments were scheduled . then , another lady arrived to paint my nails . she painted mine in record speed . i never understand how someone can manage to paint all over your skin but miss the edges of your nails at the same time . must be purposeful ? not sure . i took the polish off myself when i went home . anyway , the customer service was bad , the work was bad , and it was just a bad experience all together . also , the salon is super tiny and cramped and not fancy at all . basically , huge letdown .
0	avoid the lunch buffet . excellent chicken tikka masala .
0	experienced my first spring training game on st. patty 's day with a matchup of the a 's vs. the giants . half my family was in a 's gear and the other half in giants . first the good . i really liked the size and feel of the ballpark , felt like there was no bad seat in the stadium . parking was inexpensive and plenty of it . concessions were good and they had extra people out with buckets of beer and water . now the bad . we had seats in the outfields and the bleacher benches were built for 8 year olds , not someone over 6 ft tall . also , there was no grass areas in the outfield . overall , i really enjoyed the game , giants won , and we all had a good time . i look forward to going to scottsdale stadium .
0	i was born and raised in brazil . every time my wife and i vacation in las vegas , we eat at this place , we try to support local businesses as much as possible . this restaurant used to be good .there are two waitresses , one is very nice , but the one who is always at the register could work on her people skills , too dry . i ordered 2 beef parmegianas+2 pastels+2 cans of guarana=41 $ , pricey . the meat was terrible . both steaks had a huge piece of nerve right on the center , taking up 50 % of the steak . the nerve was as hard as bone . the 2 cans of guarana were 3 bucks each . when the lady took them out of the fridge , they were still warm so i asked for a refund and she refused saying `` you got to understand , we barely put the cans in the fridge , and it 's just $ 6 , take something else instead ! `` so i ended up taking 6 cans of coke . although the pastels were good , this place is a joke ! i 'm never going back ! check out 3 photos of the huge nerves .
0	terrible experience and service ! if you order food during happy hour , check the pricing ! the waitress would n't correct her mistake and kept on giving excuses . not cool ....
0	from the outside , with all the lights i was expecting more . it 's fun if you want to kill time and walk around looking at cheap gifts . lots of security throughout shop , and you can not carry any large bags in the store . they will take them from you and you can pick up when you exit building .
0	trashy dive bar , .gross skanky waitresses who think they are hot , mediocre food , terrible service , only good thing is cheap drinks during happy hour.also rude doorman.not worth it .
1	my only place to go for chinese food . sure it is not fancy nor is it very authentic , but if you are looking for something tasty and quick-here it is ! they have a fantastic tofu bowl ( hot and spicy bean curd ) which is perfectly spiced ! others have tried the meat meals and have never been disappointed . if you 're looking to be snooty about your chinese food , go somewhere else . otherwise this place is perfect .
1	i ca n't say enough good things about the folks at claymore / kiltrentalusa . in brief , i needed a formal kilt on short notice for my nephew 's wedding . the guys walked me through the process and delivered as promised . they did n't have the tartan i wanted available for rental , but we found a very similar substitute . i had already decided to order my own kilt in my family tartan and it was delivered today precisely when and as it was promised .
0	okay option ; be ready to spend about four hours we 've used portrait innovations twice . the pictures are good enough for routine family photos as your kids grow so fast . and with the coupons available online , it 's priced fairly reasonably . pros : despite your concerns with the look of the staff , you get some good photos ; bathrooms and dressing rooms are good ; the ability to view , select , and have your photos printed inside an hour is helpful cons : they are never on time with an appointment ( when you have a baby , this is a bad thing ) ; we 've spent more than four hours from arrival to walking out with pictures both times ; there is up-sell ; staff can seem disorganized and abrupt
0	horrible customer service ! ! ! i missed one 1 in my account number to pay my bill and i was charged 25.00 for entering the wrong account number ! ! ! i called thinking i have been here paying for over 5 years now and have never done that . surely they will credit the 25.00 for the typo . oooo no ! ! ! bend over and have to take it ! along with all the trash left on the street when they dump the trash ! ! please someone offer us another option ! ! ! !
0	fado seems to be the default hangout for my friends and i. basically , if we ca n't think of anywhere else to go , and we do n't want to think too hard about it , we go to fado . it 's close and it 's not too pricey . the beer selection is not fantastic , as far as i 'm concerned . i end up drinking cider half the time , which is a far cry from the usual ambers i tend to enjoy . the do have smithwicks , which is a decent amber , but not much else i 'm excited about . of course , they 've got the british/irish kinds of beers , but not as many as i 'd like to see . their happy hour appetizers are very good , and fairly cheap . the crab and cheese dip is tasty , as are the beef curry bites and the guinness mac and cheese ( all are 3-5 bucks ) . oh , yeah , fyi , there is absolutely nothing healthy at all on the entire menu , so ... be aware if you 're into that kind of thing . tasty , but not healthy . the ambiance here is nice , and it 's what keeps me coming back . the bartenders and servers are very friendly , and there 's a laid back vibe about the place . basically , it 's as close to a decent neighborhood irish pub i 'm going to get in henderson .
1	surprise this place does n't have many reviews . place stays busy.so on with my review . well all i can say is there service is at perfection to me . i 've heard and experience the horror storys that happens going to the wrong dry cleaners . trust me that wo n't happen hear .
1	my boyfriend and i are both from louisiana so we were excited to try baby kay 's . we both had the bloody mary which were spicy and full of veggies which we loved . he got the shrimp po-boy and i got the veggie \u00e9touff\u00e9e . both were quite good . on our second visit he got the sampler which he was less impressed with . next time we 'll stick with the poboy ! no vegan options unless you are in the mood for a salad .
0	eww ! the ten of us had spent the morning snowshoeing and we were hungry so ... waited 40 minutes to get seated in a half-empty restaurant and were immediately told `` with separate checks it will take much longer to get your food '' . 40 minutes later the waiter did not remember who ordered what , food was cold , the 'fish ' in the fish and chips was obviously frozen and was mushy . one of our diners asked for balsamic vinegar and was given soy sauce instead - imagine his surprise ! facility is worn and dirty . food on the worn and frayed carpet , wobbly chairs , etc , , i could go on . my suggestion ? pack a lunch or perhaps try the lodge up the canyon .
1	sapporo is my favorite place to eat in all of arizona . i love the teppanyaki grill . we go for happy hour quite a bit and the staff is always so nice and the food is amazing ! i have suggested it to family and friends and they all rave about the food and experience they have . i love the calamari and the scallops and shrimp . they also have the best drinks . i will be going back consistently !
1	to be honest with you i really do n't have any reason to not give it the full 5 stars . i guess i am saving that negative star for sometime in the future , nobodys perfect . 1. the atmosphere : i really enjoyed the lighting , it was n't bright like some places i have been to , and it was n't dark like others ( ra ) . i really liked the art behind the bar and the over all feel of the place . it also had kind of a sweet smell ? my only complaint was the music that was being played , it was some r & b hip hop type crap . maybe it would n't have been so obnoxious if they had turned it down a little . 2 , the service : awesome ! our server stopped by our table to refill our drinks the second it looked like we finishing them up . she was also kind enough to point out this guy that was carrying a giant knife on his hip , or as she said `` do you see the guy with the machete on his side '' . 3. the sushi : all we had were rolls this time . i saw a couple of rolls that i had never seen before `` boston california roll '' and a couple of others , but that one .. holey shit ! amazing ! i really like their take on the las vegas roll . sushi rolls = a+ thats all i got . now i am going to go talk shit on zen 32 and tv and sushi .
0	i had quite an awful experience with suzie 's mama bear several years back . it 's been a while since it happened ( about 7 years ago ) , but i definitely believe it is a cautionary experience worth sharing . i am now severnteen , but a while back ago , i used to be enrolled in suzie 's mama bear after school . it was just about the worst daycare experience i could describe for a child , but given my age , i was not able to articulate it to anyone . the daycare , as i remember it , was a wild mess . children were swearing all over , and none of the adults there would do anything about it . i had a dietary restriction to where i could not have milk , so my mother personally instructed them not to give me regular milk and brought them the milk substitute i should have drank for during snack time . the lady in charge never even bothered to use it , so i was unknowingly drinking regular milk each day without knowing it and having my health harmed . one day , i was pushed by one of the older kids who was at the daycare , as bullying was quite normal there . i fell on my arm the wrong way and broke my wrist in multiple areas . i had to repeatedly ask the adult there to call my mom over the course of an hour before she actually instructed someone to make the phone call . then , i had to wait about an hour and a half for the staff to actually call my mother because they seemed to view it as low-priority , thinking i may have just hurt myself . by the time i had arrived at the emergency room , it had been over three hours since i broke my wrist . since then , i do n't know what sort of changes have been made with the daycare , but i wanted to share my perspective . i definitely do not think this is a place anyone should be taking their children .
0	i 've been here twice . each time i got food poisoning from this place . i do n't remember the roll that gave me the food poisoning the first time but the roll that got me sick last night was the one night stand . i think the tempura battered calamari was raw inside it . it was honestly one of the worst tasting rolls i 've ever had . i 'm definitely not coming back here ever again .
1	i think this may be the best place on the strip for blackjack . my nephew mentioned this place as being the best and i agree . it has the most $ 5 blackjack tables of any place i 've found on the strip . they are far and few between . my three sisters went in together playing one wheel of fortune slot machine and managed to pull out $ 500 off of one machine the first day we were there . i probably sunk at least half of that though .. so i was n't so lucky . breakfast was good at their victorian cafe . if you go early enough ( before 8 am ) they have some sort of steak and eggs special for $ 6.00 or $ 7.00 . coffee is not that good though .
1	it 's a fun place if you 're looking to put together a pricey little care-package . lots of cool high-quality gift-ty things for the hard to shop for kid or adult . i usually stop in for their supreme collection of chocolates , local ( ahem , gail ambrosius ) and international . the chocolate and candy selection seems to be constantly changing , so i am constantly sampling . most recently i tried their new singly-wrapped spicy 50 cent carmels . oh la la . as sexy and spicy as they are sticky and sweet .
1	great local find ! good place to eat . i love their drink selections , and their food . i 'm a big fan of kimchee and beef so my favorite burger has to be the kalbi burger . i also like the ronin burger . i mean who does n't love fried egg and katsu in their burger . right ? their fries are awesome ! i recomment the garlic parmesan fries are awesome . loaded with flavor . very garlicy and lost of parmesan in it if you like that . if you want to go for a softer tasting flavor for fries i 'd say the sweet potatoes . those go really well with the kalbi burger . i also might suggest that you try at least one drink that is n't a coke or pepsi product . their beverages are one of a kind , and tastey . so be brave ! try one of them . the feel of the place is very simple , hip , and urban . easy enough . it does n't have all the extra mumbo jumbo or glitz and glamour of the strip . so if you are looking for a casual place to eat with great service . try it ! i swear it is an experience !
0	i rarely leave poor reviews , but i came away quite disappointed with this buffet . i remember coming here many times years ago and loving it , but it seems they 've taken a dive off a cliff . my wife and i visited on a friday night for their $ 20 seafood buffet . we tried the crab legs , new york steak , sushi , chow mein , broccoli beef , and tacos . nothing we ate even came close to average . you 're better off finding somewhere else to eat . the service was good , though . so there 's that .
0	this is absolutely abysmal . i 'm sitting at the table trying to figure out how to get my money back ...
1	first , let 's get this clear : los dos is * not * a `` mexican '' restaurant . it is `` new mexican . '' so if you 're expecting whatever your idea of mexican food is , you 'll be confused and disappointed . no soft tacos , no fish tacos , no big piles of tomato and lettuce with a side of sour cream . even the chips and salsa are different -- the chips are thicker and crunchier , and the salsa is thin . and there is no * mild * salsa . i do not recommend this place for vegetarians , nor is it for folks who do n't like spicy food . i also do not recommend their margaritas , unless you 're okay with paying 10 bucks for a weak , too-sweet drink -- to be fair , i like my margaritas the real , old-school way : tequila , triple sec , lime juice . that 's it . but beer lovers should find something they 'll like . if you 're smart , you 'll steer clear of the pedestrian fare on the a la cart and combo menus and order from the `` chef 's specials '' section . i highly recommend the chile relleno with adovada and the chile plate with machaca . of course , you can customize several of the dishes by selecting whichever meat you want -- chicken , adovada , machaca , etc . the only non-spicy option here is the carnitas , which i never order because i love the adovada too much to pass up on it . the plates come with beans ( very good ) and rice ( okay ) , and the servings are huge . the tortillas served on the side are thick , chewy and the perfect vehicle for sopping up all the spicy , gooey goodness on your plate . i always end up needing a to-go box , which i invariably send home with my partner -- one `` cheat '' a week is plenty , thanks ! the servers have always been friendly on my visits . last night , we had a very sweet young man who was as attentive as we would want . the kitchen and the bar can be slow , though . so do n't expect to get in and out quickly . the only thing that i totally disapprove of is the way the bill is sometimes presented . depending on how busy they are , sometimes the waiter brings you an ipad sort of device , and then stands there while you sign your bill . i do n't have an issue with going digital . my problem is that the screen basically demands that you select from one of three pre-set tip amounts -- i think it 's 18 , 20 and 22 % . i find that incredibly tacky , presumptuous and very awkward , since the server is standing there , waiting for you to finish with the device . so i hope that the owners of this location are listening : some of your guests may not know how to calculate a tip , but please do n't insult those of us who do . do not impose upon our judgement of the service . if you 're * really * worried about your servers being screwed over by angry/cheap customers , make sure your employees do their jobs well , and/or pay them better . thanks .

0	upon booking my room about a month before my stay , i requested early check in . this because we were flying in and i knew it was going to be hot . before i even boarded the plane i called the tropicana again just to reiterate the need for early check in . i was told they had my initial request on file and it should n't be a problem . i was informed to just head over to the hotel . once i 'd gotten to the hotel which i 'll admit was about 10:30am and really early , i asked if there was a room available . not shocked that there was n't because of the time i checked my bags . jo ann told me to check back in a few hours and we should be ok. will kill time getting good and drinks then arrive back at the hotel at 1:00pm . jo-ann informed us again that there still were n't any rooms ready . she says to check back in at 2:30pm . i 'm thinking , '' really ? i requested early check in and regular check in is at 3:00 but you want me to come back at 2:30 ? '' i bite my tongue and kill another 1 1/2 hours with my friend and more drinks . at 2:30pm on the dot we are in front of jo ann again , '' she tells me again there are no rooms available . at this point i 'm not very happy but i keep it together . she says and i quote , '' early check in is not guaranteed but a request . it looks like its going to be more around 3:30 before i can check you in . you should be lucky that you are even getting a 2 queen room because we are sold out this weekend . we have to accommodate our diamond club members and well as hotel invited guest first . '' i was in utter shock . that was it ! i told her , '' i should be lucky to get the room i paid you for a month ago ? ! ok ... '' at that point i just walked away . i 've learned that the people at the desk have to answer to someone so just contact the person the answer to . i get the hotel manager on the phone who is more than apologetic when i tell her that i was made to feel like my money was not wanted and that i was less important than their precious diamond club members . literally within minutes she tells me both my and my friends rooms are ready . how funny is that . i go back to the counter to check in and was lucky enough to not get jo ann . jo ann over hears that the rooms are ready and responds `` thank god ! '' . how unprofessional can one person be ? i say nothing , get my key , and go . end of jo ann fast forward to my arrival home ... i check out and head home on 7/1 . while checking my email on 7/3 i notice an alert from my credit card company . turns out there are $ 498.13 of fraudulent on-line charges on my credit card . i 've had this card for about 4 years with no issues whatsoever so that struck me as odd . now i 'm not saying that this happen at the tropicana or even that an employee of the tropicana is to blame . but , i do find it highly coincidental that this happen . the last two times i 've used that card were to book my room with the reservations department and to check in at the hotel . there were several pluses about this hotel but the minuses have overshadowed them for me . i will continue to stay at hotels that meet my standard of service ( caesar 's , plant hollywood , wynn , etc .. ) and steer clear of the `` new '' tropicana .
0	slow , disorganized service and a very rude manager who did absolutely nothing to help the wait staff or us . this is n't the first time we 've experienced this service , but it 's definitely the last . the patio is nice , but there are other options in the area with better service and food .
0	looking back at my reviews , i noticed that for the most part , they were all positive reviews . realizing that yelp is not only a place to write positive reviews that will help build business , but a place to vent and voice criticisms of establishments that do n't deserve business , i decided to write a bad review ....... and by bad , i mean horrible . umc quick care ............ two things wrong with the name . one- `` quick '' and two `` care '' there was nothing quick about my visit . i came in congested with a cough expecting to leave with the standard perscription of promethazine/codeine cough syrup , and be on my happy ass way . wrong ! after sitting in the death , excuse me , waiting room for a total of an hour and a half with no one being helped , i took off . if possible , i believe that my trip to umc quick care got me even more sick . as for the care part , did n't seem like anyone gave a hoot that i was hocking up masses of sludge that resembled banana slugs . my solution was to load up on nyquil and stay in bed . got over the sickness in three days , but would have been over it if i got the much needed purple stuff . furthermore , from what i hear , all of the other locations are just as bad ! so there you go . unless you have a real death wish , or tons of time to kill while you wait to figure out what 's wrong with you , stay away from umc `` quick care '' at all costs .
1	i went here yesterday and ate at dillion 's bbq , i had a tiny issue with my food and they fixed it instantly and it was perfect . the manager was great with me , and i will defiantly be back
1	this place is one if the best if not the best sushi place in town ! the service , fish quality and variety is amazing ! jhanga is an awesome sushi chef with a lot of unique creations . definitely worth the drive for quality sushi . i ca n't even say what our favorite rolls are because everything was super good . we will definitely be back ! thanks guys for finally getting a sushi restaurant right .
1	what a pleasant surprise . i selected pcg for a business dinner this week and all of us were thrilled with the meal , atmosphere and service . i tried the plank salmon which was wonderful . two of us had meals that included the mashed potatoes with horseradish and agreed the flavor was excellent . i admit that as i approached the strip center on 16th street i wondered if i had made a mistake , only to be rewarded by my guests with compliments for the choice . i will return .
0	i was excited to try a mac n cheese spot ! i loveeeeeeeeeee mac n cheese , every since i was little . so when i saw this spot whoot whoot , i could n't wait to try it . so many varieties , i 've never had it like this before , it seemed kinda wierd . but i wanted to step out of the box , and try something different . it 's not a fast food spot .... it 's not a fast food spot ..... it 's not a fast food spot , so do n't expect to get it fast ! ok , i think you get it ! so i got the bayou , crab & craw fish , but i did chedder instead of pepper jack . it was different , not bad ! my husband got mexican mac n cheese , it had ground beef and jalapenos in it . ohhhh it had some kick in that bite ! again it was interesting . and he also got ... ummmm , not sure but it had hotlink and jalapenos , the flavor was like the mexian one , just different meat . would i go back ? i think after i write this review , i wo n't even think about this place again !
0	cute shop with an old-timey feel to it . the popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases . unfortunatley , it is not worth going out of your way for . i had better popcorn at pnc park . it would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes .
0	beware ! just got a collections notice from a service from 5 years ago - only moved a year ago and was in their office many times between this service and this notice . tried to contact office to clear it up . have paid every other bill over the years , but that did n't matter . this was my first notice received and am willing to pay original amount ( less additional charges ) but billing dept at dr wachs says no ... wo n't even take message to dr. wachs to ask for reasonable review . office wo n't talk to me or give me details on what was performed because they turned it over to collections . collections does n't have my details , just total amount ( that has since tripled in fees and interest ) . the fact that it was 5 years ago when the service was performed and they are just trying to `` rebill '' my ( no-longer ) insurance provider ? ! ... of course it will be denied , but now i ca n't get the information needed to even try have insurance cover it . the only option they leave you unless you want to have your credit impacted is to pay the bill ... this is criminal practice - of course i do n't have paperwork after 5 years and office wo n't give me anything ? it felt like the slimiest shakedown and most unethical approach i have ever dealt with . when you try to reason with unreasonable practice policies like these , all you can do is recommend to run away from ever using this practice !
0	i see cafe anfora is getting a bit of grief for their bathroom .... ! ! it 's a cafe , not a toilet - the toilet is a minor detail . anyway , the cafe itself is n't too bad ! it serves cakes etc , when i asked if they had anything for lunch they said there was a wee problem in the kitchen , they were lovely about it so i was n't too bothered . ok my scone was a bit chewy , but it was edible . my coffee was nice and warm , just how i like it , but i noticed some people turning their back because it was too cold . uhoh . it 's not bad , but it 's not amazing either , and the toilets make it different !
0	10/23/13 at the va facility today for long awaited appointments . prior to departing i had the opportunity to visit the travel office . at the travel office i picked up a number ( 69 ) from the ticket machine , they overhead counter read 29 ! if this was n't bad enough , two windows were open and one employee occupying the right window was actually sitting down at the service counter reading a newspaper , while literally dozens of vets were waiting patiently to be seen . are these the kind of employees the phoenix va have as support staff ? god help us all .
0	so , this was the oddest `` pop in '' experience ... not sure how to rate it . brewske 's in a nice place . it 's comfortable . the people know each other and are friendly . the bartender was cool and have way too much fun . the menu is extremely casual in a `` you belong here '' way . our food took 35 minutes ( for a wrap and a sandwich ) . i 'd be a little upset about that , but my mustard chicken sandwich was one of the best hings i 've even eaten and the fries are fantastic . prices are on par with the area , if not a bit lower . i will deff be back soon and will absolutely update the review . i want to like brewske 's and i think that i really will after a few visits .
0	staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job . they had employees dry my car but when i got home i discovered spots all over . i 'll stick to fabulous freddy 's from now on .
0	i notice a few reviewers out there having the `` is it authentic ? '' debate when it comes to mexican restaurants . my first concern with mexican food is the same as it is with any cuisine , and that 's `` is it good ? '' . it 's just as easy to make bad mexican food as it is any other food , but i find so much of it out there , both here in pittsburgh and in the rest of the country . so much so , in fact , that i had decided to write off eating at mexican restaurants unless i 'm in chicago , nyc or so cal , as i 've been disappointed so often . the reviews here on yelp made me think things might be different here at cal . taco shop . not . i started with chips and salsa . the chips were a little greasy , but not really bad ... it 's the salsa that had me shaking my head . it reminded me of a can of ro * tel diced tomatoes with green chiles dumped into a molcajete . i do n't know to what extent this salsa is homemade , but it seemed to me not at all . they do offer three different pureed salsas at a table where you pick up your fork and napkin , and i found the salsa verde to be alright . i used that on my chips . i ordered chicken enchiladas in mole for my main . most of us in this country know mole as chocolate sauce , but they can be best defined as chile based sauces thickened with nuts and seeds . these sauces are different all over mexico , as regional cuisine in that country has stayed really well preserved . mexican chocolate is used as a flavoring ingredient in some moles , but , when used , is one of up to 80 ingredients that go into the sauce . the mole that most restaurants here in the u.s. attempt to replicate is mole rojo , which hails from the state of oaxaca . when done right , it 's nutty and spicy with just a hint of sweetness in the finish . the mole at california taco shop was very one note and overly sweet . there 's a ready to use mole paste in a jar out there , dona maria mole adobo from hormel , that tastes and looks alot like this mole . my conjecture is that many restaurants use it , as making mole is an all day affair . i do n't know if that 's what they 're doing here , but i am saying that this mole tastes like that . they top their enchiladas in mole with queso anejo , which was the only good thing about them . the refried beans were flavorless and uninteresting . i would say that i 'll go back and try other dishes here , but i did n't dine alone , so saw some of the other offerings . it 's just not good quality food . it 's not being prepared with care , and the ingredients are sub par . they may make their own tortillas , but mine were buried in bad mole , so i ca n't comment on their attributes . not . going . back .
0	well priced in this day and age ( no pints over \u00a32.90 ) , possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area . good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events ( & such modern highlights as cage rage ) , pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints . food on offer too but personally yet to sample it .
1	the raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty .
0	people please do not waste your money on this place as it is the biggest rip-off in town . besides charging more than anyone else in town they have no respect for their customers . i am aware there are cheaper places to have my cars smog checked but i always go here because they are close to my house . they charge more , so there is never any waiting . i have taken my cars there for over 10 years and feel that would make me a good and loyal customer . i went there yesterday and my car did not pass the test , the man working there asked me if i recently had my battery changed , i said yes . he said until i put 50 miles on my new battery my car will not pass . fine , no problem except the test they did would be $ 13.99 and to get it retested it would only be $ 10 . so now instead of paying $ 5 more it 's going to be $ 10 more than everyone else in town . i asked if the extra $ 5 fee could be waived since i am a loyal customer , he said no . i asked if there was someone over him i could talk to . he gave me the number for a jim or bill , i ca n't remember because i was very upset . this guy whom is supposed to be professional was so rude i felt like i was talking to a high school drop-out punk . i asked him if he was really willing to lose a loyal customer who has brought in 2 cars every year for over 10 years over a $ 5 fee and he said `` yup '' , not yes , just `` yup '' like a no class uneducated idiot . oh yes , i also said they should post a sign warning customers about if they had a new battery installed their car would not pass . the bully owner or manager replied `` we do n't have to post any signs '' . really snotty . i know they do n't have to post a sign , but it would be a nice courtesy for the customer , but wait , then they would n't be able to rip off the customer . also if you use a credit card or debit card there is a $ 1 surcharge . this place can not find enough ways to rip off the customers . i am disputing this charge with my credit card company , i so hope i win , not for the money , just the principle . i am not going back for my $ 10 retest , i would rather go elsewhere and drive a little farther and pay $ 15 then give them another penny of my money . whatever happened to do n't pass do n't pay .
0	this sonic is pretty bad when it comes to customer service . the window helper sounded like this was the last place she wanted to be and looked it as soon as i got to the window . i 'm not expecting perky and perfect but friendly and alive would have done just find .
1	i hate shopping because it makes me hungry . so , after a half a day of shopping at forum shops , we went to sushi roku . they have big tables and couches so you 're not cramped/ feeling claustrophobic . since we were n't terribly hungry , we only ordered a few rolls/nigiri ( $ 7-22 or market price ) : black truffle tempura handroll , salmon , albacore uni and tuna . we also ordered from the specials menu ( $ 6-90 ) . with a glass of riesling in hand , we got ... yellowtail-wrapped foie gras with truffle soy : my eyes automatically scope out `` foie gras '' and `` truffle '' and send a signal to my taste buds that i 'm about to have something amazing in my mouth . so amazing that my hands did not get a signal to take pictures . you 'll just have to try it to know how beautiful this is . 5/5 robata style japanese wagyu beef with hawaiian pink salt : you get a nice presentation of your skewer on its own robata grill and a spoon with pink rock salt . the wagyu is tender and fatty - feels nice on the tongue . the pink salt accentuates the flavor of the wagyu . 5/5 scallop and foie gras togarashi with black pepper and white truffle oil : it 's like a re-run of the first dish i had except this time , i got distracted by the black pepper taste . the scallops were perfectly cooked . 4/5 blue fin tuna sushi : the fish was at the right temperature . the texture of the rice was just right . the fish to rice ratio was perfect . 5/5 black truffle tempura handroll : this is wrapped in a thin soy paper . there 's avocado inside . the truffle flavor is in the sauce . 4/5 the service was excellent . our server was attentive .
1	very delicious food ! we are not vegans or even vegetarians , but we just love this place ! we have been trying to eat healthy lately , and this place was just perfect for that . the consistency of the mock chicken dishes was almost perfect , and we were n't left with that sick , full feeling in our stomachs . wish this place was closer to where we live !
1	this place has super easy parking and a spacious inside with a large patio outside . the service was lackluster but the pizza was great ! we ordered the kosmic karma and it was the best pizza i 've had in months . have n't tried anything else yet but i 'd go back for sure .
1	wanted to try a local place and heard good things . the place is modest with a friendly staff . for the love of jesus , if you ca n't take heat , do not eat here ! the posole was amazing and you need to try the homemade tortillas ! a bit different than the posole i 'm used to but this is a new mexican style restaurant so it 's a bit off from the mexican food i 'm used to from chicago . overall a good experience and will definitely come again ! !
0	the big secret construction project ... first of all i want to say i have stayed at the property a dozen times in the past , and it had been wonderful , but in my opinion the ownership has ruined this property , when i showed up to `` the hotel at mandalay bay '' , i had my 1st surprise pulling in the parking deck , `` the hotel at mandalay bay '' is in the middle of a name change ( new hotel name delano '' ) its having a identity crisis , plus its going through a complete remodel , the lobby is torn up , god forbid if you want a drink in vegas because surprise there 's no bar , no lobby furniture , no restaurant , no gift shop , no coffee or snack bar the place is in giant construction mode , you ca n't even sit down in the lobby , not even a chair to sit on or a couch to sit on , i am in the lobby watching hotel guests sitting on the floor like there in a fine japanese restaurant on the floor ! as much fun as that sounds not today ! do n't you think the hotel should have said something during booking ? how about an email prior to arrival ? this would at least have given you a chance to move to a different hotel . here the most insulting part they offered a $ 50 credit on a $ 2000 room bill for the inconvenience . and to this day they still do n't mention the construction on their website . do yourself a favor stay away ? while in my remodeled room in the new delano my surprises just keep coming ........ 1. the complementary high speed internet is really not high speed at all , its 3 mbps , but for $ 20 dollars a day you can upgrade . 2. the in room coffee is gone ! ca n't find it ! 3. the pillows were new and felt like left over walls of the old hotel , like bricks , i thought that went with the new earthy feel of delano ! 4. and if you 're looking for some place to hang your clothes after a long day of travel , surprise there is no closet ! 5. towels- i called 3 times to get more towels ! surprise still waiting . 6. bedding- in vegas , outside the temperature was 107 degrees , so surprise they had used goose down comforters on the beds , let 's heat up everything . 7. water in the shower- this is the place you want hot , the water ran for 7 minutes and never got hot , i will give the engineering people credit by the 4th day and i did check out they got the wait time for hot water down to 4 minutes . if you decide you want to bet in las vegas , make the best bet you can , and this would n't be one of them ! stay away !
0	restaurant moved location about two years ago , and the menu was changed a bit . still a diner atmosphere , and on our recent visits the food was only fair . service was very slow and they may have been understaffed . it 's ok as far as restaurants go , but there are several nearby that we prefer . meals are not too pricy , but the food is mediocre at best .
0	the only thing i like about this dinasour is entering through the kitchen . unfriendly bartenders , two of them , food is ok , but let 's not go crazy here , it 's not great . just another `` institiution '' that gets a free pass because ... i do n't know why they get a free pass . the red-flocked wall paper is older than dirt ; so are the waitresses . just so mediocre . so many other places to go .
0	came here for a typhoid vaccination for travel today . it was easy to find and get to . it 's set up exactly like the dmv , except a lot less crowded - blue cubicles , take a number , wait , etc . it 's clean , but very gloomy / fluorescent / typical government building . i was in an out of there in 30 minutes . girl at the counter : friendly , nice . nurse vickie : super nice and friendly ! chit chatty , informative , and yet still efficient . cashier erin : also friendly and helpful . so , why the mediocre review , you say ? the god awful security guard . he is on such a little power trip and is so uninformed that he should not be the first person people interact with when they arrive . he is also so overweight that i can not imagine him stopping anyone from causing mischief if they wanted to . the story .... ( fresh and still annoyed ) i come in - `` hi , do you need some help ? '' ( so far , so good ) `` yes , i 'm here for a typhoid vaccine '' `` ok , you need to fill out the white form '' ( points to the wall ) `` ok '' ( i start heading over to the wall ) `` we do n't allow food and drink in here '' ( could n't have told me that before i started walking over to the wall ? ) `` ok '' ( i start heading out ) `` you need to use the exit door '' ( points to other side of the building ) at this point , i 'm still game . rules are rules , whatever . maybe they have a security camera that points a certain way and need to have the same number of people entering as exiting or something . going to give him the benefit of the doubt . guy 's just doing his job . i come back in , take a look at the `` check in starts here '' table which has the same forms i saw i needed online with clipboards and pens . `` are these the right forms ? '' `` no , you need the one on the wall . '' i walk over to the wall . the forms on the wall ( no clipboards , no pens ) are exactly the same as the ones on the table . the white forms clearly are labeled 'childhood vaccines ( under 18 years old ) . ' `` are you sure you do n't mean the blue one ? '' ( the blue forms are labeled `` travel vaccines '' ) `` no , the white one . '' ok , whatever , maybe they only use the white form now or something . i take my number , fill out the form , sit down and fill it out . i get called very promptly and am helped by the friendly girl at the counter , who informs me i needed to fill out the blue form . i knew it ! so maybe the guy did n't know what a typhoid vaccine was for . he could have asked , `` what is your vaccine for again ? '' i swear , he gets off on making people 's lives just a little more difficult . it 's like he 's a supervillain - inconvenience man .
1	wow , wow , wow , wow , wow . what a great find ! next husband i have , is getting a wedding band from this store . very manly looking designs , beautiful , handsome , high quality . i 'd be very proud to have a band from here on my next dude 's finger . stop by if you can . tucked into the inner depths of fashion square mall . be sure to take a map and water and a flare gun .
0	cheaters that 's the best way i can describe my experience yesterday at this location . i was upgrading to an iphone 5 and trading in my iphone 4. they told me they 'd give me $ 92 dollars for the 4 but i had to put that towards 3 accessories before the remaining balance could be used for the iphone 5 ... i called verizon customer support and it was confirmed that this was completely out of policy . the reps at this store were `` upselling '' me the second i walked in . the guy who was helping me actually brought out a tray of accessories with my new phone that he expected me to buy . also , if the rep is reading this ... i know the difference between an otter box and the slim cases ... thanks a lot !
0	* update * after posting this review i got word they were talking about it on fb . i posted a screen shot of their fb post and i think it sums up the exact issues we had with their service . very rude * we had a nice server so he is mostly excluded from this review . the rest of the experience was really disappointing and our whole party wished we would have left and gone somewhere else all because of how things started off . let me just say this place was practically empty the whole time we were there . there were a few people but most tables were empty . it was a pretty early dinner reservation . we originally only had 6 people confirmed for dinner the night of my birthday celebration but we had 4 more people confirm last minute . we called as soon as the breadfruit opened to see about extending our reservation . they told us they would only accommodate groups of 6. this was a huge pain bc it was an hour before our reservations and people were already on their way . we were able to convince them to reserve a 2nd table next to ours on the patio so we would all fit and be able to sit near each other . only after they confirmed we 'd be ordering alcohol in addition to our meals of course . upon arriving we realized we had the whole patio to ourselves and if we pushed the tables together we would all be able to fit comfortably together with room for another table on the patio should they have more diners . we asked if we could push our tables together and they were very snotty telling us we were basically lucky that they even agreed to accommodate us to begin with and the set up they created was our only option . we should bow down and kiss their feet for taking us at all . like seriously ? ! you ca n't make any exceptions ? ! it would be one thing for us to suck it up if it clearly was n't possible but it was totally possible for us all to sit together without changing a dang thing to the outside set up . it does n't change anything ! ! ! our group could have sat together for crying out loud . it was totally possible . so stubborn and rude . so that really set the mood for all of us . if we thought someplace nearby could accommodate a group of 10 last minute we would have pimp walked outta there . but we endured it , tried to get past it for the sake of the meal and enjoyed all of their tasty drinks and the food was good . i loved their pina colada redux . the spring rolls were super boring flavor wise and left me thinking `` what the heck , yelpers ? ! why did so many people recommend this ? '' . my jerk chicken was tasty . about 95 % of our group smokes so after the meal they went to the back area to have a smoke ( it sounded like they had a nice area just for this ) . the servers chased everyone down in the smoking area and tried handing them the bill while they were back there enjoying themselves making things really weird . while the majority of the group was in the back smoking area they served me a free birthday dessert which was awkward bc should n't you do that when the whole party is around ? they knew most of my party was out back seeing as how they chased them down with the checks . i blew out the candle and the few of us sitting there tasted it . it was one of the grossest things ever so thankfully it was free . it was a really sweet gesture though ( but just fyi ... dont order the potato dessert pie or whatever its called . better known as barf pie . i totally understand why they give that one away for free . no one would pay for that . just saying ) . but still , really kind birthday gesture . * ok , after reading some other reviews you people are loving this sweet potato pie . i am officially convinced they served us a rotten piece on purpose * they do n't usually let people split the check ( we noticed this printed at the bottom of the menu ) but our nice server offered to let us ... only he made us divide everything up for him . i mean , is n't that his job ? i get that it is n't normally allowed but he offered and it would have been really nice for him to divide it up for us . plus the restaurant was not busy and we spent a lot of money on food and drinks . it 's the least they could have done but they apparently hate accommodating customers or providing an enjoyable dining experience for larger groups . this behavior would be acceptable at applebees or something . ugh whatever we were just so ready to get the heck out of there bc we were so clearly not welcome . i def wo n't be back and i know most of my party will not be back based on this experience . this place really is only good for super small , intimate settings . i would n't recommend going here with more than 4 people . they make it known that they do n't really want you there if there are more than 4 of you anyway so be prepared to have a horrible time if you 're with a group . also , you ca n't even order breadfruit at the breadfruit .
0	in line for check in at harrahs with people lined up going out the door and only one person working at check in . amazing . seriously one elderly lady all by herself .
0	had issues over parking . i went in to discuss them with the owner and found him to be most unfriendly . i will wo n't be eating here and would encourage others to stay away also .
1	the buns ! i think that was the best part of the burger . super soft chewy buns ! had the mushroom swiss burger and the western one ( had onion rings and bacon in it ) . and the sauce selection was bomb digs ! they even have the nifty coke machine with a bajillion flavors . i would totally go back !
1	we found this place off of yelp and after reviewing the reviews my husband and i decided to try it out . we went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the food and atmosphere was awesome . i do not recommend to take small children . the atmosphere was very romantic with dim lighting and they had someone to play live music on the accordion . i ordered the house special which was the whiskey shrimp and chicken . this dish was so good , it did not disappoint . my husband ordered the bake zitti which was great as well . for both of our meals plus wine and a few beers we paid an average of 60+ bucks . we will definitely go back again with friends and family .
0	this place serves supposedly the best cheese steaks in vegas . so far i tend not to agree . i had a chicken cheese steak with mushrooms and was sorely disappointed . the portion sizes are excellent , and it looked delicious and i could n't wait to get it in my mouth . and once i did i found it to be fairly flavorless and very dry . when i did manage to find a little pocket of cheese , things got a bit better , but they were few and far between . perhaps i 'll give them another shot someday , but for now my quest for the best chicken cheese steak in vegas continues ....
0	worst cheesy breadsticks ! i 've ordered this item from other locations and it was great but this location 's version was terrible ! they were over cooked , cut in half and with 50 % less bread sticks than other locations . barely any cheese as well .
0	i do n't like the pizza , pasta , or stromboli here one bit ( after multiple attempts ) . you can do way better elsewhere ( try rocco 's just across the 215 ) for actual food that is mark rich 's namesake . but the tuna melt and french fries here are absolutely fantastic . i think they use provolone cheese and it makes for a great sandwich , if a little greasy . the greek-style pita and mozzarella sticks are pretty decent as well . otherwise , this place has a nice , family-run , slightly upscale feel to it ( e.g . it 's more of a sitdown restaurant than a fast-food place ) . service is friendly and prompt enough . too bad about the pizza , but if you are craving a tuna melt , mark rich has got you covered .
1	both parasol up and down are great places to go to in order to start a night . i usually go there with friends before hitting one of the clubs at wynn/encore or while counting down the time to a reservation at one of the many restaurants at wynn/encore . i prefer parasol down because it 's slightly quieter and has a more personal feel , parasol up however is open later and is more accessible ( not sure if its 24 hours though ) . in addition to this , both bars have a great selection of spirits to choose from , including brands that are n't available at other higher end bars including death 's door gin .
1	we went in at 7pm with a groupon , got a lane right away and had a blast ! everyone was very nice .
0	good ny style pizza ! do n't forget the fried ravioli , garlic knots , and greek salad ... all winners in my book ! my only dig on the place is the way they do sausage as a topping . instead of chunks of sausage scattered about the pie , the sausage is cut in thin slices lengthwise . eh , not my preferred way to go , and it really does n't look good that way , but it still tastes good .
1	i love this place .. they 're sides are the bomb i always get the brisket dinner w/mac n cheese & baked beans ..
0	we went around 11 pm on a weekend . we were seated quickly , had our beverage orders taken ( 1 coffee , 1 beer ) and were id 'd for the beer we ordered , then recieved only the coffee . turns out the busser could n't serve beer or something despite being of age . when our server made his way over , we had to reorder the beer and show id again . after placing our orders , we quickly recieved the soup ; a thick , processed-ham flavoured ordeal that had probably been simmering since early that day as it had thickened into a mud-like consistency . then we waited . and waited . we watched several tables finish . our waiter ran about doing his rounds until we had to flag him down to ask for another beer . after about twenty , thirty minutes our food arrived . we had ordered chicken 'tenders ' ( whatever that means ) as an appetizer but they came out with the entrees . the boy had a steak while i had the cobb salad . his steak was flavorless and tasted like poor quality meat cooked without any love . he ate several bites and sent it back . the tenders were moist but on par with frozen grocery store offerings . the salad was the alone stand out as it was a massive bowl full of salad . i usually feel silly ordering a salad out when i can make one exactly to my likings for about the same amount of dough , but this thing was big enough to split between 3 people easily and be satisfied . our server was a lot more expedient and attentive after the steak was sent back , and the hostess came by to inquire as to what was wrong . she seemed genuinely concerned that we enjoy our meal and told us how to avoid being re-carded for beer ( go to the security cage , prove your age and get a wrist band ) so the star is for her . it 's cheap food and if you 're staying there it 's a nice late night option if you 're not in the mood for sbarro . we 'll probably be headed to ellis island next time , though , as the environment is a bit nicer and the beer is cheap , generously served and the food is about the same if not a little better .
0	food portions were gigantic and flavorless . service was absolutely despicable . the server was sitting there texting on her phone , charging me 3 dollars for hot water and a tea-bag , and i was just sitting there , staring out the bullet holes in the glass windows , wishing i could have gone to wild thaiger .
0	as far as the rooms , amenities and pool go i give this joint 2 stars . it gets the extra star because the slots we 're loose ! i was w/a group of 5 , we all went home with money in our pockets and hit some good wins ! it was a fun novelty to stay in a little part of vegas history ( the beatles , as well as marilyn monroe have stayed here ) . you can even reserve the beatles room they apparently stayed in . i loved the old school spacious balconies ! very good for a ..... * ahem * smoke.we stayed in the `` historic '' part of the casino . but , you can not control your rooms a/c ... this was n't too much of a problem regardless of the fact it was 102-104 degrees during the day . well , not for me . for my roomies , it was . anyways it is controlled by a `` central a/c unit '' or something , so basically the casino had control over how much cool air you were graced with . lol . let 's just say they were a little stingy ... this room cost me around $ 40 a night , so i guess you get what you pay for . but i know of plenty hotels in vegas for the same price if not cheaper that let you control your own a/c ! ! ! if you sign up for the free slot players blub , you get a cool little free souvenir w/your name on it , ha . the buffet is very big , edible to okay food quality and only $ 6 w/the card as well . overall , unless you 're a huge beatles fan or something i would n't recommend this place . unless you can find a use for that balcony like i did .
0	a group of us ( 12 adults ) were staying at the jw and wanted to have a nice dinner . i spoke to aaron lee ( group dining coordinator ) and he set up the reservation at the meritage . they do n't have a private room so we got a corner table . i had preordered 2 seafood platters , calamari/shrimp , and sweet potato fries . we arrived and was promptly escorted to our table . at 8pm on a tuesday night , they dining room was only at approx 40 % capacity . we were immediately served water and cocktail orders were taken . cocktails were a tad pricey at $ 15 . i tried one of their signature cocktails ( pomegranate and whiskey concoction ) and thought it was good , just not $ 15 good . we ordered some white and red wines as well ( fair selection ) . the seafood platter was nice . oysters were decent . you have to ask for the drawn butter if you want it with your crab legs and lobster . i thought that made it better . people said the calamari and shrimp was over seasoned and i would have to agree . fries were just fries . for my entree , i opted for the prime rib ( medium rare ) and the rest ordered the rib eye . i thought my prime rib was cooked perfectly . i liked the smokiness that was hyped up . the entrees did n't come with any sides . we ordered the cream of spinach , mash potatoes , and mushrooms . the sides were just ok. i still would prefer lawry 's prime rib and their sides over this . the rib eyes were good . we had some issues with the temperature of the rare and medium rare . the waitress initially came out and made it seem as if we were wrong ( `` when you see it in better lighting , you would see that it was cooked properly ) but sent it back . i mentioned to her that rareness is judge not only on color but temperature . and the steak she brought out was too warm to be called rare . the chef came out himself to apologize and made sure the new ones were cooked well ( and they were ) . he also sent out some extra sides . from that point on , service was great . actually it was great throughout . we ordered a couple of the desserts . the banana cream pie was awesome but the creme brulee ( chocolate ) was just ok. my last complaint was that we had a package with the hotel and was suppose to receive free appitizers and desserts . i thought the group coordinator would pass this along to the restaurant . we never got the freebies . and when i wrote the coordinator about it , i did not get a respone ... all in all , this pace was decent and deserves a 3.5 star rating . it does n't really stand up to the flemings , maestros , or the other high end steakhouse . but for being on the resort property , not a bad choice .
0	i 've only had one cupcake from here , so this is based on very limited experience . but , in my one visit i formed a 3-star opinion . i came in around 9:30 on a friday night . there were 4-5 cupcake flavors to choose from plus a brownie and maybe three different types of cookies . the setup of the shop is a little weird in that the cupcakes are displayed on the side , so if this place ever got busy and a line formed it would be a little chaotic to see which cupcakes were available and then actually get in line in front of the register . the menu was posted on the wall adjacent to the display case , but i did n't even notice it until i had my cupcake and was sitting down . but those are minor issues . i ordered a vanilla cupcake and took a seat . the cake itself was dry and the cupcake was way overpriced at $ 2.99 for being so small . the saving grace of my purchase was the icing . it was delicious ! the sugar sprinkles on top were a great touch . i 'd come here again for a cupcake , but i find the high pricetag really annoying and a major put-off . cream & flutter has cocktails in addition to milk , coffee , and tea . this makes me wonder if they are trying to position themselves as a place to hang out instead of a place to go just to wolf down a treat . if the former then the interior needs work . it 's a bit stark and the chairs are n't the most comfortable to just sit and relax . a cozier atmosphere would be more conducive to sipping a cocktail and staying there longer . but , again , not sure if that 's their goal or not . in short - i 'd go back ... begrudgingly .
0	like a lot of other dtlv casinos , the four queens is small , old , and wreaks of smoke . nothing really at the 4 queens that gets me going here . however , i still have friends and family that love this place only because they 've won her before . if you see me here or check in here , it 's usually because i 'm here with out of towners . fairly loose slots based on people i know . table games are okay with minimal limits . the bars are packed , but nothing worth bragging about . i do n't frequent the 4 queens like i did back in the mid-90 's . but will stop by because i tend to use them for their parking .
0	as a regular at the keg next to chandler mall , it pains me to say that my last two visits were less than stellar . when setting up nearby tables , the busboy sent the utensils crashing across the tabletops . twice in a row , there were families who could not control their children : screaming , doing somersaults in the aisles , etc . and then to order the recommended fish that turned out to be too dry to swallow ... i am really disappointed ! where is the management presence ?
0	got my pedicure and manicure done less then 15 minutes . the fastest mani & pedi i ever experienced . i was very disapointed . i could just go buy the nail polish from drug store and paint myself . i went in and expected to file cut , dead skin or push back and perhaps an oil hand massage but nope , just two layers painted and finished coated then tah dah ! done ! ... oh and one of my thump nail got some bobble in it . theres nothing more that i hate is to see bobble in my nails . she got another client and start doing her nail and totally abandon me at the freezing air drying station . i was like am i done here ? hello ? dont waste your time and money ! go buy nail polish and paint yourself . you can do it better then they can lol
0	expensive , glorified bar food and crappy server . the view was great though , right across the bellagio fountains . be fair warned , food is mediocre . they need to really fix this place up . how disappointing .
0	mary coyle is some pretty good ice cream . i would write a longer review , but the history has been covered , and the atmosphere . i would like this place more , but purchasing ice cream to go afew times i have noticed i need to let it thaw for a month before i can actually eat it . it 's frozen that hard . other then that this place is pretty cool . : p
1	i love shopping here ... it 's much better than paying full price at the stores ! they have a great selection of stores from the moderate to pricier spectrum , and are opening up more soon ( hello kate spade and aldo shoes ! ) . you can also sign up online to be a vip , and then get extra coupons that way . who needs to shop at the forum shops anyway ?
0	i really , really wanted to like this restaurant . hip , quirky , vegetarian/vegan . lots of owls and kitschy deco . i eat meat occasionally , but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit , and thought this would be a great choice . what 's not to love , right ? well , for starters , the service . our server was really nice , and had lots of reviews , suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order ... but the service was mind-numbingly , ridiculously slow -- and the place was half empty . plus , even after two requests for napkins ( which were not provided to begin with , and not available from other empty tables around us ) we never received any napkins at all . i 'm not really a messy eater , but come on ! maybe part of the problem was expectations ? we kicked things off with the `` firesticks '' appetizer -- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things . after that , our orders ( i had the thai salad ) were just kind of ... boring ? strangely spiced ? i feel like the bar was set high with the app , and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness , and my dining companions agreed . i also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese , and it was awful . you know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave , and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together ? well , it was exactly that , with some powdered garlic sprinked on top . really . i should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $ 4 for a cup of that . learn from my mistake . we had planned to order milkshakes , too , but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned , we 'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes . for $ 4 ( and probably a ridiculous wait ) per milkshake , we decided to hit the milkshake factory on east carson instead .
0	i have frequently shopped in this store because of its location and there are no other nearby choices . i was in early today and for a change , there were carts and no one was rude to me . i purchased over $ 200 worth of fabric and 7 of the 22 pieces were short . i tried to call the store and it rang for over two minutes . i tried again and the manager said he would call me right back . i 'm still waiting . i have vowed before , with difficult experiences at this store , that i would not return , but this time i think it will stick . in the future , i will order from other establishments online , even though they might cost more .
0	had a private function here - beautiful space and the staff was attentive and friendly . not much here for vegan 's and the kitchen did n't try to accommodate very well even though they had all the ingredients to make a great salad !
1	first class ! ! ! ! i can say that this is the only place in charlotte i will get my nails done . from the moment you walk in the door until the last nail dries you are pampered , spoiled and adored ! the nail professional are top notch , well trained experts at their craft . lina is part of our family , she has cared for me for the past four years and now her newest customer is my four year old daughter , katherine ! i could go on forever with wonderful stories about all of the amazing staff ! do n't miss an opportunities to visit this gem of south park charlotte !
1	hands down one of the best places to get a burger -- especially a veggie burger . this place is crazy delicious . it is one of the best meals i 've ever had . their milkshakes are simply unbelievable -- especially their smores . there are a ton of options and even for a burger joint , it is super vegetarian friendly ! be prepared to leave extremely satisfied with a large food-baby .
0	okay i was super hungry when i walked in , so i expected like the usual , 5 , 6min wait on my order , but the princesses in the front were to busy making their orders from del taco and writing them to one of the coworkers who was going to get it for them , they literally forgot to serve the food to 3 of the order which one of them was mine , then after 15 min ridiculous wait i asked if my order was ready they were like : what did u get ? `` seriously ? ? ? ? they looked into my ticket and were like ohh okay , then i asked for a sauce , she throws it in the platter ! ! ! the worst costumer service ever , they messed orders and ppl started to get angry , these girls should not do costumer service .
1	big portions , tasty and some of the best service we have received ! this will be my vegas go-to breakfast place .
1	this is my favorite sushi restaurant in charlotte . i 've dined her many times and the sushi is incredibly fresh , artfully displayed and well priced . if you 're looking for an excellent dining experience , look no further . this place is a true gem- and because it 's new ( er ) to charlotte the line is n't out the door . i ate there last night and i 'm already looking forward to going again .
1	i stayed here for a weekend to attend a wedding , and let me tell you this place has everything for everyone . the kids loved the tournament of kings , the wife loved thunder from down under.what more can u ask for , as for me i just wanted to gamble . it 's pretty cheap too if your bringing the whole family . could n't have asked for a better time . cool hotel !
1	i 'm not sure if this is the exact ross location that we went to , but we had a great time shopping at ross . if you want to shop here , make sure you 're in the mood to dig through lots of clothing ! that 's what we did , and we came out with some great bargains . i got an adorable pair of shoes for $ 10 , among other things . it 's not well-organized at all , so make sure you search for your size , and do n't trust the little signs on the racks with the size numbers !
0	i visited siena on tuesday with a bridal shower party of 16. the private room we were given was beautiful , but that was the end to the perks of the restaurant . the bread service had pita chips and bread with an olive tapenade . it comes in ramekins that hold 1 tablespoon of tapenade , and given to share among 4 people . so , we were pretty much all able to have 1 slice of bread with tapenade on it . wonderful ! we split an aragula salad which was actually very tasty . it had figs and some tasty cheese , but a tad too much dressing . that was the best part of my meal . my mother-in-law next to me ordered the penne ( i think ) and the pasta looked homemade . i suppose that 's the one up-side of this place . several of the pasta dishes looked like it was homemade pasta , but me , wanting to be healthy , opted for something low-carb . when it came to ordering , i opted for the salmon with a side of asparagus ( 4 stalks ) . my friend next to me ordered the same thing , and we were both incredibly disappointed . the salmon looks like it was butterflied in half so that we each got about 3 oz . of salmon that was incredibly thin . mine was over-cooked to say the least , but hers was burned . the whole outside was black and charred ... unfortunately , the salmon which came highly praised by the waiter ( whom i only saw one time when he took my order ) , was so small that i ended up starving and eating a bunch of bread just to fill up . so much for low carb . since our party was so large , there was an automatic 20 % gratuity attached onto it , which would be fine , if i ever got a refill on my water glass . i was so thirsty , i almost drank my friend 's water . sorry , but i will never be back . i think most of the people at my table shared this sentiment . my total for half a of a salad , very poorly cooked , thin salmon , and 4 stalks of asparagus with 20 % gratuity was $ 36 . i think i could have purchased a weeks worth of wild salmon and cooked it better myself .
0	i 'm from out of town , but that does n't mean that i do n't know a good bar . i used to promote for bars and this is exactly the kind of place that i would steer people away from . the atmosphere is very pretentious , and it is what i would consider a middle class college bar . every person around me that spoke to me , or that i spoke to made me feel like chances are there is no hope left for humanity . the drinks were good as far as quantity and price are concerned . i 'll put that in the plus category . if there was one thing here that stuck out to me the most it was the abhorrent music selection and the drunk people throwing up in the booths on the patio . if ever i find myself in phoenix i will not be back .
0	this review is based on a single dinner at cafe bellagio . the first thing i noticed was the nice opulent decor , followed by friendly greetings by the hostess and our server , julie k. the meal then began with a warm tasty roll and butter , followed by a good crab dip spread on toasted baguette slices . but the dip could have been creamier . a crock of french onion soup with well-melted gruyere cheese was excellent , and dense meatloaf topped by brown gravy and mushrooms was very good with mashed potatoes and green beans . unfortunately , the chef read the ticket wrong , and diane had to send her medium burger back to receive a medium rare replacement . then she pronounced her bacon cheddar cheeseburger with parmesan fries as tasting very good . 3-1/2 stars overall ! we will likely return for another meal when we are in close proximity somewhere on the strip as dinner time strikes , and have no other dining plans .
0	a real dump as far as del taco locations go . the bus stop out front provides a steady stream of degenerates coming in and out . fairly clean inside and the food was average for a del taco , but the service was slow . i wish i could type slower to emphasize just how s-l-o-w it really is here . =o )
0	+.+.+.+.+.+two things have changed in the past 30 days +.+.+.+.+.+.+ prices have been increasing quite frequently ...... and they just did it again . enough is enough ...... they now have become very expensive . we 'll still continue going here ........ reducing our visits by 50 % . there 's a wonderful chinese restaurant at shea and 92nd street that gives much larger portions ..... at about the same price as flo 's . secondly the remodel is beautiful ..... however , why was n't the rock concert noise level remedied ? ? ? ? ?
0	so excited to try the cronuts . i drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort . cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted . i also ordered a caramel latte and oh my god ! i never thought someone can screw up a latte like that ! never will i go back to this place .
1	great affordable place and all the food is very fresh . i visit a lot as it is close to my house . tried quite a few menu items but my favourites are the rare beef and brisket soup and their mixed dumplings and imperial rolls . yum : )
0	i 'm happy with cmi for the most part - the maintenance staff in particular is great . i live in an older building , so it has its own set of age-related problems . with every issue i 've had , the maintenance staff has delivered . very pleasant people , too . the office staff can be difficult at times - i always hang up feeling like i 've bothered someone or i 'm an annoyance . wish the candor would change . regardless , my requests are always fulfilled , and i ca n't complain about that .
1	the view here is amazing ! ! we had no problem getting in . granted we did go after midnight so even us girls had to pay a cover , but it was worth it . now , the ghost bar is n't a `` dance club '' but the dj does play amazing music . you know the dj is great when he can mix kanye west and journey ! ! there are signs that say `` this is not a club . no dancing , '' but when we walked up there was already a dance floor in progress . if you do n't want to hit up a busy club , i recommend you stopping by the ghost bar . it 's very relaxed , the view is amazing , and drinks are good .
1	my husband & i both got great work by andrew black ! ca n't wait to get more -such an amazing artist ~ thanks andrew
0	i 've been to the raj a few times since moving to leith 5 years ago and always thought it was ok. i went last month however and it was just a bit tired . no one there really seems to care about the business , which saddens me as it 's a lovely spot with some unique stuff about it . the portions are n't particularly big , for the price you pay certainly , and none of the food really delighted me . i hope things improve before long !
1	this is now the only downtown lunch spot for me now . the food is fast , delicious and tastes super fresh . the staff are all very friendly and legitimately seem gracious to have your business . the prices are really fair for how much you get , and it is always nice to have a good vegetarian friendly spot for a fast cheap lunch . ca n't say enough . go .
1	this review is long overdue ! i thought i had already written it , but apparently in the craziness of finals i forgot . anyways , onto my review ... after driving back from california a couple months ago , my check engine light came on and my car was shaking like crazy . upon referral from a friend , and after reading all the yelp reviews , i decided to bring my car ( honda crv ) into valley automotive . boy was i glad i did ! i got an initial estimate from kc and his staff , but after doing some work it ended up that there was more wrong with my car than was initially thought . however , rather than me having to pay for the additional fixes , kc offered to foot the bill ! i was shocked , but forever grateful ! the thing that sets valley automotive apart from most other auto shops is they care about their customers and want to do right by them . as a graduate student with little money , i appreciate the honest business and work that kc and his staff do at valley automotive . i happily referred a friend to them so she could get a second opinion after taking her car to another shop . valley automotive saved her money and she was equally as impressed with the service she received ! apparently my car does n't like the vegas heat ( who does like 115 degree weather ? ! ) and i noticed that it is leaking coolant . i will gladly be taking my car back to valley automotive and doing business with kc and his team again !
1	i grew up in arizona and we went to wongs every sunday after church . three years ago we got stationed in hawaii . everytime i come home , our first stop is wongs . i love everything about it . wongs is my comfort food .
0	although i also really enjoy mi familia ( just down the road , literally ) , i really hope both restaurants succeed . this roberto 's have a drive thru and is open 24hrs which is always nice when looking for something at any hour . service here was good , food was yummy as always ! restaurant was clean inside and out ( always a big deal for me , after all-they are preparing our food ) the only reason it is 3 stars and not 4 is their phone service : i 've called 3 different times now ( we 've been eating out a lot lately ) and one time the phone was answered in spanish , so i hung up . the next time was ok and the last ( 3rd ) time was 'hello ? '-phone skills are every bit as important as anything else . if you 're rude to me ( as they were ) then i 'm going to go somewhere else ( as i said , mi familia is just down the road ) . please , thank you , you 're welcome : theseshould be standard on every phone call . do n't act like i 'm inconveniencing you when ordering ... update ( down grade from 3 stars ) : i went to pickup my order ( `` ready in 10 minutes '' , then she hung up ) 15 minutes later and it was n't even started . today my neighbor and i both have food poisoning-stay away from the chicken and do yourself a favor- go down the road to mi familia . nicer people , family owned , and quality food .
0	worst pedicure ever ! went in there for the first time yesterday afternoon . they were busy but still had plenty of chairs open for pedicures . my friend and i got seated right away and everything seemed great . then the nail tech handed me the card to pick out which pedicure i wanted . the `` regular '' is $ 19 and includes `` nail trimming , brief massage , basic nail color . '' the only other option was a $ 40 one with callus remover , scrub and paraffin wax . kind of ridiculous that they only have two options with such big price differences . all other nail places i 've been to at least include hot stone and a decent massage in their basic pedicure . i chose the regular with no extras . the nail tech seemed annoyed by that and totally rushed through everything . the lotion `` massage '' was pretty much just her slapping some lotion on my legs . we were out of there in about a half hour , which is the shortest time i 've ever been in a nail salon for a pedicure . the nail tech did not thank us for our business and did not ask to see us again .. so i will never go back again !
0	five stars for the entertainment and food , and staff .. a two for the management ! i love going to flanny 's on friday nights because of the entertainment . last friday night gerry mora was performing and as usual was excellent . i was so distracted when the owner was making hand gestures to gerry about lowering the volume .... how disrespectful ! ! john if you want to keep quality performers and customers stop treating them like crap ! ! i 'm done with flanny 's . there are plenty of other places to go in the area ....
0	mgm might have the finest poker room ever with the most charismatic dealers and the best manager in the business ( mr.boyd ) . but , they got a real problem at the rest of the casino and hotel . last year reservations made a crucial mistake that cost me about $ 100 . i made a reservation for a saturday , and even told the agent that i wanted the room for saturday and she confirmed the numerical date as well . when i arrived on saturday , they had no reservation for me . the front desk agent who had a thick eastern european accent was in a rotten mood due to the guests who she serviced before me being very out-of-line and difficult . she was still steaming when i got to her and she had abandoned all of her customer service and hospitality skills . eventually , she had found out that the reservation agent had made my reservation for friday . i insisted that it was mistake and she shouts : `` why are you people doing this to me today ? '' . i could have interpreted the `` you people '' remark as a racist remark , but did n't know if that comment was due to the fact that english did n't appear to be her first language . eventually she told me that she was not going to charge me for a no-show on friday and that she could check me in . that turned out to be a complete lie . i did n't catch it until recently , but i was looking though some bank statements and noticed that she in fact did charge me as a no-show . the casino floor is not that much better . i played blackjack for 4-6 hours a day , betting about $ 50 a hand for about two weeks in a row here , and my rewards card still has a comp balance of $ 0.00 . i believe that this is one of those casinos where they do that vegas style `` age discrimination '' . many vegas casinos do not like to comp young people who are in their 20s , no matter how big they bet . they like to comp the geriatrics and seniors even though they may only play penny slots . there is no real rational reason why they do this but remember that since the corporations took over vegas , they have been losing revenue due to their marketing department being full of unqualified pretty girls and trust fund babies whose dad 's had connections to get them in . i still would like to point out that the people who work at the gift shops are very nice and polite , and the dealers are all very qualified to work at such an upscale establishment . but , next time i have guests in town who i want to impress , i will absolutely never check them in at the mgm .
0	3.5 stars they did not have any fresh crawfish , only frozen but they tasted fine ! the crab was 15 a pound and we got the biggest one they had , but honestly , i rather just go to a buffet and eat all the crab i want . i just love the whole sha-bang sauce ! ! so unhealthy but soooo good . also loved the oysters ( yum yum ) and the clams . bf ordered the wings ( cajun ) which are really good but i get sick of them after about 2. wish they had gloves tho like other places do , only b/c cuts on ur hand sting when u squeeze those lemons .
0	beware ! ! you do not want to see this doctor . he is only in the health care industry in order to over bill insurance companies . i was referred to this practitioner and when i checked his credentials i did n't find any board actions . i called to make an appointment and let his office know that i was a cash patient with no insurance and was looking for a specific type of doctor . i was never told that he does not write refills , but rather forces his patients to come into his office every month , which for a cash patient is initially $ 220 and then $ 150 every subsequent month . he charges ridiculous fees too . he charges a $ 25 fee if you are more than seven ( 7 ) minutes late to appointment and then they cancel the appointment and make you reschedule . this while i waited in his waiting room for almost 2 hours before i was taken back to a room and then waited another 30 minutes . they also charge a $ 50 fee to fill out paperwork that may be required by an insurance company , if it 's more than 2 pages long ! ! another yelper wrote that she liked the tablet computers you use to do your paperwork on , but she perhaps did n't notice the additional fees they charge you to have digital paperwork/files . he refused to help me with the initial cost of the visit and told me he never works with his patients if they can not afford to see him . apparently they would prefer to lose patients rather than help them out . also when i called to make an initial appointment i was never told the doctor does not confer with other doctors , such as your prior doctor , and never writes refills . he also refuses to give patients additional medication if they run out over a weekend and ca n't get in to see him before they run out . had i known about all this beforehand i would never have made an initial appointment . when i told that to the girl on the phone , she insisted that only two people make these types of appointments and they always tell the patients this . not ! ! save yourself some serious hassles and stay away from this guy ! ! i 've never seen a provider that refused to help out his patients monetarily if they are in a bind and really need help . i 've never seen a provider that refused to speak with my old doctor in order to get additional information about me . and i 've never seen a provider that refused to write refills and forced his patients to see him every month instead . seriously , who does this ? oh yeah , dr. allen does ! ! not to mention that not more than two ( 2 ) weeks after seeing this doctor i got very sick and found out i had gallstones and needed to have my gallbladder removed , but for some reason dr. allen missed this diagnosis . hmmmm .. not surprised .
0	i 've passed this place several times since it opened and i kept saying i wanted to come here based off the few pics the yelpers had posted , but i was disappointed that they were out of 2 of items i wanted to order . they were all out of brisket and the baker had not come in yet to make most of the pastries so it was very limited . the cashier was nice the and the cafe gave u the feeling of being in a lil cafe somewhere other than in vegas ( which was refreshing ) . with all that being said , my husband ordered the sirloin burger which i might add was huge and he enjoyed it ! i however ordered the avocado burger which is advertised w a pretzel bun , which it was n't . now this might seem very minute to some , but my agreement is u ca n't just serve a burger on a sesame bun and not even acknowledge that u changed the bun all together .. all in all my husband enjoyed his meal so it was n't like the food was bad but they need to fix some inconsistencies .
0	the tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy . i probably could have told this just by looking but i had gotten lost on my way to ginger 's and was hungry . at least it was cheap .
0	i really expected more from all the hype i 'd heard surrounding this place . it 's near my work and i 'd heard their food was amazing . after visiting them 4 different times for business lunches and a birthday party , aside from some decent fried pickles , you 'll find nothing more than below average bar food and sandwiches . i would steer clear and ignore this overrated sentimental bar and grill .
0	the waterfall behind the dj is the only amazing thing about this place . it 's filled with 40 yr olds , and they play top 40 songs mixed with random hip-hop music . makes me feel like im at an 18+ club with creepers all over again ... even the go-go dancers do n't seem to enjoy it
0	the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant is very nice . the hostess gave us a brief tour of the restaurant . we were a party of two and were seated by the west facing windows at 6pm . the shades were down but they staff could not lower them all the way . it was ok but slightly warm . the servers and server assistants provided us great service . the gm , laurent came by and greeted us . the drinks were just ok. quite expensive . one was $ 18.00 and one was $ 15.00 . i than ordered an anejo on the rocks . $ 19.00 . that 's really high for patron brand anejo even in las vegas . we had clams casino , not traditional but tasty . we also had the charred octopus . it was good . next was the tricolore salad . it was very good . our main course was the spaghetti with shrimp . huge shrimp , but the shrimp were over cooked . the pasta was a bit dry . needed a bid more sauce . we also ordered the salmon . i ordered it medium , it came out over cooked and dry . the coffee and grappa were great . the pb & j mousse was too warm and very ordinary . i wish i ordered the polenta cake . the dessert guys told us the mousse was the pick . all and all , just average . we spent $ 260.00 with tax and tip . the service at the tables around us was really slow . we were the there for 1 hour and 45 minutes . the tables next to us had just received their entrees when we were leaving . they arrived just 10 minutes after us at the latest . they did not seem happy and sat with no food in front of them for an hour . it seemed like there were many tables like this . so we had very good service and very average food with a pretty high price point . its all about price value perception when your rating restaurants . unfortunately a celebrity chef has their own big shoes to fill . especially when they are rating other peoples cooking on tv . average is the rating !
0	i know i said that they were professional and all , but the other day we received a bill for what the insurance would n't pay . it came in a decent envelope , but then we opened it . plain sheet of paper with printing . no tear-off portion , no return envelope ( not to mention return postage - i would n't expect that from anyone ) . just a sheet , badly folded , printed out on a cheap printer . so much for professional . i guess that only extends to examinations - and presumably procedures . definitely not to the billing department . we get a lot of medical bills since we started buying our own insurance , and this is definitely the cheapest of the bunch . i get that it 's only a few cents for an envelope and all - but it ca n't cost them much more to have some reasonably pre-printed invoices with tear-off return portions , much less a return envelope . it would just make for a nicer experience , you know ?
1	yoko is pretty good , prices are just right and service is friendly and prompt . i would recommend this to someone .
0	the 6 of us ate there on a wednesday evening . we waited for almost 15 minutes before anyone even greeted us at the table . after giving the our waitress our drink and food order , we waited another 10 minutes to get our drinks , bread and butter . 22 minutes later our waitress explains that `` chinese kitchen '' is unable to provide won ton soup . okay ... so why did n't she explain this much sooner ? so i ordered chicken parmesan with garlic bread instead . another 25 minutes pass or so ... we finally get our food ! ! ! so it took over one hour just to get our meal ! ! ! ridiculous ! ! ! by that time , the kids were so tired of waiting , they almost fell asleep . i 've had bad service in the past , but this had to top it all . never again will we eat there ! ! ! the food had hardly any flavor ... who hired these cooks ? this place does n't even deserve one star ! ! ! ! do not waste your time and money here ! ! ! ! horrible service ! ! !
0	food was absolutely horrible ! service was mediocre . it all tasted like frozen or out of a can - nothing authentic . spent about $ 100 on two adult meals , two kids meals , one beer and one frozen margarita . what a waste of time & money . do n't bother going , even the food court was better .
0	these elevators take you very high ! i would like to congratulate cosmopolitan for having the best elevators in vegas since they always smell of pot and grass and one would get high just by trying the elevators a few times . i was just there two nights ago for marquee and damn , i could n't walk straight after i got out of the elevator.this year i did n't stay there since my gf got really sick because of our rooms unsanitary conditions ( pics posted ) since my complaint last year , due to our disastrous experience at cosmo , rico ramirez from their damage control team contacted me and asked me to call him . after giving me a bunch of bs he promised refund but did not do anything . this hotel is the haven for punk hoodie kids and black gangsters . just stay away from this dump !
0	ah yes . the smell of cigarette smoke in my clothes and in my hair after 10 minutes of walking through the casino to get to my conference . i remember it well . mgm grand is n't awful , but it is n't all that grand either . when i made my reservation , i was recovering from a foot injury . i asked where the conference i was attending was being held , and specifically asked for a room that would be closest to this area of the hotel . i could have chosen a room at mgm or at the signature at mgm , and was advised that an mgm room would be closest to the conference area . oops . because upon arrival i remember walking a half a mile before running into the signature , which was much closer to the conference . my foot did not appreciate this . the clubs , food and entertainment in the hotel are not bad , but i did not get a sense of las vegas opulence while staying here . the lions they have look sad . in fact , i was actually depressed by the entire scene , and would try another hotel if i had to return to sin city .
1	great place to grab a piece of pizza downtown ! we did n't go into the actual restaurant and order off menu but instead elected to sit at counter and choose slices out of the window ( we were starving and can never agree on one pizza topping anyway ) . the cooks were nice , the pizza was good and we all left full off our one enormous slice of pie . would definitely go back .
1	i don ' know if she sang one note . i do n't know if you can call it dancing . i do n't know if it was even her . that said - full tilt boogie on crowd enthusiasm and we had a blast . i had one frozen drink there and was blotto-fied . well worth the 20 bucks . if you are a fan go , if not - probably wo n't become one .
1	the husband and i love this place . we have been coming here ever since we moved to the neighborhood and both the food and service is consistently amazing . we have tried most of the breakfast menu but have n't dived into the lunch menu . our favorite is the gouda brizza ( breakfast pizza ) - smoked gouda , bacon , hollandaise sauce , and scrambled eggs . yum ! on lazy weekends , we order this to go and enjoy back at our place . when we dine in , it 's a mix . their costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently . i really like their mushroom and bacon omelet , but i also enjoy their `` two eggs anyway '' meal . i normally get scrambled eggs , bacon , pancakes , and fruit ( instead of potatoes ) . super delicious and filling . another favorite are the biscuits and gravy . now this is amazing ! the biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside . they just melt in your mouth ! the gravy is the perfect accompaniment . it 's thick and filled with sausage . these are some of the best b & gs i 've had ! the best part is how inexpensive yet utterly delicious they are ! i love that it 's a local place that uses local food . everything is fresh and the staff is outstanding . we 've taken both sets of parents here as well as friends . this is definitely the go-to breakfast place . if you are ever in the area , you should definitely check it out !
0	going into it , i did have high expectations based on the ratings and reviews i had seen . my husband and i got cookie dough and cookies & cream . we both left completely unimpressed with at taste of sour milk in our mouth . maybe we just got a bad batch ? i do n't think we will be going back again anytime soon .
0	chicago brewing company ( cbc ) is alright in my book . they 're open 24/7 and have consistently decent food . the variety is n't much and there 's nothing healthy options on the menu . i will highlight that the soups and house-made root beer are too legit to quit . the bar section is separated from the actual restaurant . happy hours during the game are extended into the main dining room . good service , decent prices , and portions are large . i always need a to-go box when dining here .
0	a horrible representation of the native new yorker franchise , this location is filthy dirty . we sat in the lounge for a beer and some wings and i immediately noticed the sticky/dirty table , i then noticed the shades were covered with sauce and slime of every type , the staff was engaged with conversations with `` regulars '' and failed to pay any type of decent attention to other guests . my cousin ordered wings which were ok but the service was impersonal and un attentive , this is the worst looking and ran native new yorker i have been to . the decor is horrible and rivals places on reality tv that need a major makeover , i would guess if corporate came here they would shut it down . this is a sad snap shot of a good company .
1	this place is great ! it is a little on the pricey side for the evening admission ( the day time is without monsters and just a walk through ) there is a guy out front that hands out a $ 5 discount , so it 's manageable . i asked if there was anything we could do for additional discount because it was my friend 's 30th birthday . they could n't do an additional discount , but they gave us a few 2-for-1 drink discounts . the place was a lot of fun too , it 's a decent walk through , with a lot of attention to detail . the actors are really fun and really get into their characters . they 're not afraid to be rude to you and fully get into things . a lot of places that do stuff like this hold back , but this one was really a lot of fun . i know some people say it 's not worth the price , but if this is the sort of thing you are into you 'll appreciate the acting and the details and it is in fact worth it . also , the people running it are super nice and awesome . my friend and i both bought a picture at the end and they printer was having issues , so we only got the first picture out and they were working on the printer . it was closing and i felt bad , so i asked if i could just pay the difference and get a hat . they just let me have the hat , mind you , the second picture is only $ 5 extra and a hat is like $ 20 . so my friend and i leave and we 're like 8 stores down the line as they come running out to us because they got the printer working and gave us our picture . so we got a hat for free and they ran out and found us to give us the picture . i 've never had service that nice anywhere . i totally recommend this place , for the scares , the atmosphere , and the awesome people !
1	this is a great gym . it 's small so it is n't overwhelming . they have exactly what you need to get a good workout in . there are n't any meat heads like at globo gym , i mean golds . the staff is friendly and ralph is great ! there 's some nice eye candy from time to time as well . the steam room is a great feature as well . i actually prefer this location over the shea location because you do n't have to deal with all the d-bag high school kids working out on their phones taking up equipment . arin at the desk makes a killer smoothie too !
0	once you step into this place you are amazed at the money and creativity they put into this place . i totally could live in lady silvia and make is a batchelor pad loft , just by moving a few pieces of furniture out to make room for my bed . this place is super rad inside . the bartenders are great and very much good at sitting and talking to you and remembering your name and shaking your hand when you come in . the things that give it only 3 stars are the price of drinks , the gaming in the top of the bar and the never ending `` soft openings '' . i wish they would just have the dadgum grand opening already ! ! the drinks are twice the price of the drinks at artifice 3 blocks away and the table top gaming is irritating because it 's what i do n't want to see in an artsy fartsy bar in the arts district . they are just in the way of putting your drinks down and all the times i 've been in there i 've not once seen someone playing on them . i usually bring friends in here to show them how awesome it is in there , have one drink ( because of the high prices ) and then head on down the road to artifice or dino 's where my booze money can go 2 to 4 times the distance . i would give this place a solid 5 stars if they would do away with the gaming and lower the drink prices . just saying my piece mike and sam , you guys have a great bar . just needs those tweaks to make it what it needs to be and to get it totally packed .
1	we went there with one of those group-buy coupons , and we had a great experience . the service was very friendly , the dishes were very tasty , and the ambiance was really classy - with gorgeous exposed brick and modern decor , but without any of the pretentious or gaudy vibe you sometimes get from places trying ot be modern . my favourite part of the meal was the mojito , which was phenomenal . the only reasons i left off the fifth star are that ( 1 ) unfortunately , they did n't have my first two choices listed on the menu , and ( 2 ) although the food was delicious , it was n't a life-altering religious food experience , and those do exist . it 's really solid , though , and the mojitos alone are worth making a reservation !
0	i 've been here a couple of times now and it 's a totally straight forward standard hotel with free internet ( wifi and cable ) , free breakfast , free airport shuttle ( one of the few in lv ) , and free shuttle to the strip ( dropoff at mandalay bay ) . down the street there is a big outlet mall with a whole bunch of food and shopping options which is convenient . this means that you are n't out in the boonies despite being `` off strip '' . not a bad little hotel , i 'll be back .
0	does it shock you that this place blows ? does it really ? ok , let me back up , as i 'm assuming that every reader is as horrified with pop culture and the way our world cultivates youth . i for one am simply primed for vomiting when viewing the primordial meat markets the likes of scottsdale clubs foster . but this place really takes the cake . i 'm eccentric and irreverent when it comes to decor , so the overall appearance of the place ( gawdy , mostly ) does n't bother me ... at all . it 's really just the simple and complete brainlessness of the whole operation . the food is mediocre and the margaritas are standard . the waitstaff is commonly too busy posing and catching their reflections in the one of many shiny , distracting objects to provide any standard of service . and the management , my , are they pretty ! pretty useless ! but , i 'll rip the term `` doucheburger '' right from jake c. ( that 's awesome , by the way ) : this place is filled with 'em . whom i 'll bet pair nicely with the allll the cougars . ( those two terms rhyme a little ... try them together , i bet you 'll like it . )
0	the car wash does not work very well . people inside were nice , but paid $ 6 for a brushless wash that should be called a wash less wash .
1	just moved into a new home this summer . old home had a sw greens putting green complete with t box and sand trap we hated to leave behind . well , we called sw greens and scott came out and designed a better putting green than in the old home . we love it . great knowledgeable design followed up by an excellent installation team . these guys do a first rate job and they are competitively priced . thanks sw greens for our great new putting green !
0	awful customer service ... awful . like i do n't care about your safety awful . do not stay here find another place in downtown vegas . i stayed here last year for punk rock bowling we figured it might be a cheaper golden nugget since it still had a pool and the place was huge . boy , was i in for a surprise . i reserved a smoking room , a friend of mine also had another smoking room . we both got there at the same time since we carpooled . we get non smoking rooms . we ask why their reply `` we already filled up the smoking rooms we only have non smoking '' . ok then why have us reserve anything in the first place .... kinda annoying but whatever we can smoke in the casino i guess right ? rooms are whatever , at least they look kinda cleanish but what does that matter when we 're out partying all night and just using using the room to sleep and nurse our hangovers just do it all over again . second day i wake up to a banging and the sound of a door jiggling . i think maybe its my hotel roomie half awake/ still drunk trying to get in . when i get up i notice she 's passed out in her bed too . the room next door is banging on the door that connects our room and trying to open it . what the hell ! ? call management . they go in and talk to the other room which denies it . i ask to have my room changed . i tell them i do n't feel safe . `` sorry we ca n't do that '' . what about my belongings i ask .. `` there 's a safe by the bathroom '' thanks ... its about the size of an iphone ... the issues with the room next door continue . its not funny anymore and i 'm genuinely scared to be in my own hotel room . i ask a friend to stay with us and tell him what was going on . we call management again . we all talk about it again . i tell them how unhappy and unsafe i feel in this room . i get denied another room again . our last day . it happens again . this time our friend gets up and sternly tell them to stop . goes outside and knocks on their door to try and see what is going on . nothing happens but we can hear movement from next door . it does n't happen anymore . i finally get home happy that i do n't have to fear for my life anymore when i go to sleep and what do i see on my credit card bill .. an additional fee from plaza hotel . i call and ask what it was about. `` management saw you with an additional person in the room . '' are you fucking kidding me ! ? yes , because you assholes did n't do shit about 2 girls being harassed every day in your hotel . after a couple of minutes going back and forth and speaking to one manager then another i 've officially had it and im tired of repeating the same story . they have no record of what happened with the room next door and the times that we spoke to management . but some how they know that our friend stayed with us because we felt scared to be alone . charged me the extra money so that i could feel safe in your piece of shit hotel because you did n't do anything about it . thanks plaza . i hope you get shut down . you 're a huge waste of space and judging by everyone else 's reviews i 'm not the only person that thinks you guys suck .
1	we have been a fan of the michoacan brand of restaurants for years . we have visited all of them at one point or another and many times for a special occasions like birthday 's . i can not count how many time i have been called ponchito . everything is fresh and delicious . i always go for a combination plate because i can never decide on just one thing so i decided to eat three . the fresh guacamole made table side is a must have . the service is always top notch . everyone is very attentive to the guests needs weather it be a refill of water or chips and salsa . if you can not decide on what to get ask a server and they will make a recommendation you will not be disappointed with . these guys are locally owned and operated so be sure to go out and support them . sunday they do a brunch with 30 plus items that always look delicious . i will have to try that one day soon . sometimes during the week they have a man playing a piano and singing which can add a nice vibe to your delicious meal .
1	the most delicious burger i will ever have in my life ! ! ! ! i 've only tried the miyagi burger and i do n't have the guts to steer away and try anything else because it is my absolute favorite ! so juicy and mouthwatering , i ca n't wait to go back again ! i would also suggest the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries ! soooo good ! ! ! you will definitely not be disappointed ! overall , awesome food and clean setting with friendly staff ! see you soon bachi !
0	this is not an experience for a tourist . it 's for people with a kitchen . walking around , i noticed very few stalls offering samples , and there was next to nothing in the way of ready-to-eat food like you see at many other markets . maybe i 'm spoiled because pike place is my market . also , surprisingly small . i figured this is the south , and the warmer climates produce a greater variety of food year-round . it 's held in a relatively small parking lot next to old town .
1	stop . i like this place . i do n't want to hear that this place is some generic watered down japanese food restaurant or something . i do n't think this place was made to be authentic . it 's catering to a broader audience or to first timers who want to get their feet wet with some asian food , or people who just want that quick asian food fix without the full menu experience i 've had the chicken , beef , pork , and katsu plates . their house dressing for their salad is unique like a sweet vinegerette . their gyoza and shrimp tempura is just like what you 'll find in any japanese restaurant . the food is flavorful and made from scratch and made to order . sizable portions that are satisfyijng to your belly . service is quick and courteous . it 's great fast food without the grease and the short order cook with a spatula banging on the bell yelling `` order up ! ''
1	this place is prettty large and awesome . a wide variety of organized items . video games , current magazines , books , and board games are a plenty . staff is friendly .
1	no matter if it 's a good or bad experience my husband and i alway find ourselves talking about what a good manager this location has . he is always open to help his employees . not sure of his name but he is tall and slim . kudos sr. we the regulars to this location notice everything !
1	friendly , accommodating , and the pizza and wings are always good . it is one of my go to places for a casual dinner out .
1	noca is a great place for a date . it is a culinary experience , with all its style . the chefs are working extremely hard right in front of you and they have many interesting things on the menu . we had appetizers of the duck confit and some sort of sashimi . the duck confit was great and had some really fun elements , like the huckleberry waffle ( ? ) first for me . the sashimi special was awesome as well . we also received a small sample of a duck mousse , tasted like tuna and mayo , which was alright and some cauliflower soup , yum ! i had the duo of berkshire pork , which was highly recommended by the waiter . it was good in an artsy sort of way , but i was n't completely blown away . it said it came with brussel sprouts , but it was really 3 leaves of brussel sprouts , haha funny . the pork chop was n't so great , apples added depth though , and the pork belly i did n't care for . the demi was good though . the donuts for dessert were pretty good as well . i liked the dulce de leche dip . they gave us some homemade shortbread to take home , very good . the service was wonderful . i did wait at the bar and was suggested a very nice sauv by the bartender . the place is so tiny , reservations are a must , we had to sit outside , but it was a lovely night . i wish this place had some great view overlooking the city instead of the grocery store parking lot . managers did come up frequently to check on us and gave some insight and great suggestions . our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive . i will go back and try a different entree and hopefully it will be 5 stars next time . : )
0	the food was pretty solid ( pulled pork ) , price fair , and there was a nice selection of beer on tap . however , the waitress was a total beast from the moment we sat down ... like we were inconveniencing her by being there . never once a 'you 're welcome ' and certainly nothing close to a smile . someone else served our food and we did n't see her until it was time for a box . i realize everyone has a bad day but i really do n't like being made to feel like i 'm the problem when i show up willing spend my money at their place of business . her behavior will keep me away for awhile ... plenty of good bbq places in charlotte !
0	the entrance to pure was mobbed with people . we had made previous arrangements with a staff member to get our large party ( 14 , mostly girls ) inside . it was nearly impossible with the poor line control . we finally made it inside but were quite disappointed . the primary downstairs area was extremely packed and too dark . the open air dance floor upstairs was much better . i do n't want to sound snobby , but ... the bouncers seem to let everyone . there were also quite a few extremely drunk individuals that i would have expected to be escorted out , if anyone had been paying attention .
1	pretty good ramen if not a bit pricey , but still wayyyyyyyy cheaper than the strip . not too oily and the broth and meat were perfect . i had the delux shio , though i was a bit bummed by the size of a standard . i think next time , i 'll get a non deluxe option and bump it up to a large for just a buck more .
0	$ 6 exterior car wash , and you can find a $ 2 off coupon online . makes for a cheap car wash , except i have to get out of my car to dry off my car after it 's been `` dried . '' you get what you pay for !
0	i have been going to zipps around the valley since 2006 , but they all have been in the central or east valley . i was very happy to see a zipps open up on my side of town ; now my i can have my sports fan friends meet me on my side of town . the first time i get a group together - it 's because the asu bowl game and the university of kentucky basketball game was on at the same time . what better place to watch both than my favorite sports bar . i know they 'll have both games on - i know my devils are playing but uk and louisville are both undefeated . to make sure this would be a good spot and they would play the basketball game too , i called ahead and they said it would be no problem . now i applaud zipps for putting asu on the big screen and every screen , but when we requested to see the uk game it could only be put on a tv that was behind our table not even on a tv that 1ft away from another tv both playing the asu game . come on , i 'm alumni and and sports fan and that 's just ridiculous and silly . so then , the manager says we can take over the patio . ( nice we get out out in the cold ) the manager says we can have a certain spot by the fireplace - o go figure the minute we get up to move a family of 12 sits there . so we try and sit by the tvs you can see most of them are crappy screens and of course the heater does n't work . so we get to sit in the middle of the patio looking at a blurry picasso rendition of our teams playing big games . the food was zipps food , but it was so so . the only thing keeping me from walking out is i still had beer in my 32oz mug . did i mention i called ahead ? way to come up short zipps .
0	casears palace seems a bit overrated.ive been staying at this hotel everytime i have a family trip out here and some of the rooms are nice and some are completely horrible . the only thing that i would make me rate this place as one star is because customer service i.e valet annnnd bell boys are fucking rude . they do not greet customers with a smile nor do they treat you with good hospitality . valet denied us even though we were diamond members and bell boys talked down to my dad when he was checking our bags in.bell boy even had the nerve to question why we tipped him what we did.excuse me ? he doesnt even derserve a tip for how he treated us ! he should be thankful we even tipped him ! thanks caesars for a horrible welcome and goodbye !
0	the food here looks better than it tastes . i have eaten here a handful of times , and the last time was the last time . i am very flexible and adventurous when it comes to dining , and have very few hangups when it comes to food . while i am fully aware that there are many breaded and deep fried items in different asian and pacific island foods that have bones in them , i personally did not expect to bite into a breaded piece of chicken katsu with a little bone in the end . i almost broke a tooth ! i am sure this is normal , but my favorite joint , ma ' i island grill did not have the bone-in variety , and i just was n't expecting it . moving on , the flavor of every dish i have had here has been lacking . they have a wide variety of sides to choose from , but most of them seem like canned food items that were dumped into a display case . no complex flavors , nothing to write home about . one of the most disappointing items on the menu is the macaroni salad . it is n't bad , but when i go to eat hawaiian , this is something i look forward to , and it is plain and bland here . i have heard the korean food is good here , but it is pressented as a hawaiian food place , so ... all in all , there are better choices when looking for hawaiian dining , just yelp it out till you find one worth going to .
1	well , i like the idea of motel one . always in the center of the city , somehow modern design , good beds . no fancy unnecessary stuff . all of this is true for this motel one in edinburgh . perfectly located even if it 's hard to discover . breakfast is ok , but not more . service is friendly . no twin rooms available ..
0	as far as budget accommodations go this place was alright . the staff is friendly , helpful and flexible . the dorm rooms themselves probably try and pack a few too many people in to them and the beds can be a very squeeky . it 's located a 7 or so minute walk from the heart of old town , which if you 're staying for more than 3 or so nights can get a little repetitive . overall i 'm sure better could be found , but if nothing appeared in a search i 'd come back here with no real hang ups
0	my matcha tea latte is in a really big cup . outstanding customer service . wish the location had a scenery or in the inside of the plaze .
0	the food was only okay .... if you 're in the mood for comfort food it would hit the spot . the fried chicken and the cornbread ( baked sweet , just the way i like it ) are good and if i came back i would order those . however , the waffle was disappointing : -/ it was flimsy and soft , whereas i like my waffles to be crispy on the outside and thicker . the service here was outstanding . everyone from the hostess to the servers were extremely friendly and attentive and happily made us a custom drink ( half sweet tea , half regular tea ... bc the sweet tea alone is way too sweet ! ) .
1	wow ! ! wow ! ! fantastic show ... you ask yourself all the time `` how 'd they do that ? '' .... really enjoyed it ... tip ... do n't see too far forward ... a lot of action is up high ... go for the middle
0	well , this place is good . the food is kind of that outdated tropical fare and lacks any sort of innovation . the atmosphere has that tgi fridays chain feeling to it , but instead of shit on the walls its upscale tropical . i wouldnt really go back unless i was invited by someone else .
0	this is more than a yogurt bar . they 've got burgers and apparently waffles . the air was heavy with oil when i walked in . i like to try several favors when i visit a yogurt bar . my first attempt was the mango sorbet . when i pulled the trigger a bunch of thick liquid globbed out . we asked about the sugar free `` dairy free '' vanilla and the cashier proceeded to tell us it 's not really dairy free . the flavors of my selection were disappointing . this was the worst yogurt bar experience i 've had .
1	pretty simple : i walked in , explained what i was looking to do and they did n't sell me anything . he said `` here 's a sample of what i would use , i actually use it . it 'll do good and if you do n't like it , come back and we 'll try another sample . '' he was right , i loved it and did what it was supposed to . went back , picked up a full bottle this time and still friendly as heck . i tell ya , a vitamin shoppe or gnc seems to always want to sell you . then you get to the register and its `` this is paired with ____ usually '' ... more selling . not here . good advice and a friendly atmosphere . when i need something again , ill be back , and ill reccomend to friends !
1	this place is a gem ! the food is awesome !

0	this place sucks always get order wrong and dont want to fix it also got mold on tortilla and they said it was ok
0	couple friends and i were walking down the strip and went by . we mainly noticed it because the place is incredibly loud , and the music is pretty good . we were n't going to stop , but a friend was buying some beers at their bar since the beers are usually 2 for the price of 1. as we were waiting for him one of the guys outside was trying to get us to go in at $ 15 each , to which we said no thanks and started walking away as our friend was still getting his drinks . we walked probably another 5 feet before he ran up to us and said he would do $ 10 each , to which we still told him no thanks and then we got our friend and went to left . to which the guy came to us again and said $ 5 each to which we still just walked off . so finally he let us in for free after about 3 minutes of trying to get us to pay . we went in , probably stayed for 30 minutes , maybe and hour . it was loud , music was good , drinks were decent priced , so i was semi content there , but the girls there were very meh , even with a buzz on , and a lot of the guys there seemed like frat guys who were too douchy and got kicked out of their frat . so we left , i do n't think i would go back at all
1	it always tickles me to find a little slice of heaven in my own back yard . barrelhouse is it . hidden in a strip mall , once you 're inside , the hip , almost industrial vibe sets the mood for a laid back evening of eclectic cuisine , drinks so delish you 'd think they had a chemist behind the bar and a respite from from a formulaic chain or an over priced indy restaurant . i 've been there twice . first time , service was a little shaky , but they communicated with us abut the situation and we had an amazing dinner . plenty of time to talk and catch up with friends , while enjoying cocktails and appetizers prior to the entrees . i knew they were having an off night -- -they were more upset about it than we were . food was amazing . last night , we gave them another shot . service -- - five stars . amazing . food is nothing less than marvelous . i had caribbean jerk spiced sea bass and it 's the best i have ever had . my best friend had pot roast -- -simmered for 8 hours and while i would never order pot roast at a restaurant , i would order this ! ! ( your grandmother has nothing on pot roast compared to this . ) i could go on and on about the menu , but check it out for yourself . it 's unlike any menu i 've seen -- -- from grass fed beef hamburgers to truffle mac n cheese . you can make reservations too . enjoy a little find in the east valley !
0	worst customer service . they are so rude ! i go there because it is right down the street from my work . the cashiers are not friendly , the staff is not helpful and if you go there within 30 minutes of closing , they are even more rude . if possible .
0	they close at 10pm . we got there at 9:15 and the host refuses to seat and serve us . will never go back there and give them anymore business .
0	skaters beware , this is a communist park ran by racist people who do n't like skaters . this place had ridiculous rules that constantly change . be very careful , if someone there does n't like you , they will kick you out . do n't waste your time or money here ... sucks sucks sucks sucks . including the staff !
0	i purchased a groupon for an oil change but after upgrading to synthetic oil i ended paying $ 94 in top of the $ 15.00 for the original oil change . honesty ? i did n't get it at this location . no savings at all , you will be scam is no way out . you will see it . also they give a price $ 239 for rear brakes pad but they did not get me here , i got it done for $ 89.00 .
1	definitely worth watching . the girlfriend took me to see this and i was very pleased . the transitioning from land to water was amazing . do n't waste your time on ny cirque du soleil shows ... stick with vegas ... wow
1	la tolteca is outstanding . passing through phx and a friend ( and frequent visitor to az ) told me i need to stop here . he spoke truth . get the chilaquiles ! get them . we also had tacos de papa , and caldo de camarones ... the latter was awesome too , delicious broth and packed with shrimp . the salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we could n't get enough of . i 'll be back to la tolteca . five stars no hesitation .
0	horrible , sushi was not fresh at all like the other reviews have said . lobster tail were horrible too . they did not taste like lobster more like a giant schrimp , crab legs were whatever , dessert was horrible . do not go here ... i spent 41 bucks and was mad !
1	i ca n't believe some of these reviews are of the same over easy i go to every time i 'm in mesa ! my food has always been very good , service perfect and cleanliness impeccable ! i 've tried just about everything on the menu and never had a complaint . oj is $ 6.00 because it 's fresh squeezed . i mean how many restaurants make their own jam ? over easy does . people need to understand that small restaurants do n't have the buying power of large chains , so of course the prices are higher . my only complaint is they wo n't build one in yuma !
0	wow ... really ? ? no , that 's not a good wow . that 's a `` i paid that much for this '' wow . if i 'm being perfectly honest , i was not impressed at all . that being said , i went in with an open mind and empty stomach . ya know , everything is supposed to taste better when you 're hungry . nah . it really did n't . service was great . from the beginning to the end . the host was polite and pulled our party of four through the long-ish line and sat us quickly [ no , we are n't vip ... though at times that would be awesome ] . the waitress [ ? ] was quick to clean our empty plates and refill our beverages . i 'm hesitant to call her a waitress because she was n't really waiting on us . but regardless , she was good . the food was ehhhhhhhh . i 've really experienced better back home [ in chicago ] and definitely paid less [ we went for lunch ] . the selection was limited ; it is `` multicultural , '' but there were only like two or three dishes per cuisine , and there were n't many different types of cuisine . i left a underwhelmed and way too full [ i tried to get my moneys worth ] . i 'm curious to how different dinner is compared to their lunch . hmm . is it worth the risk ? try it yourself and message me . i 'd be interested in your take on what was once revered as the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of lv .
0	tried to eat lunch here today . was sat near the fireplace until a table opened up . waited for a half hour with no service . three servers came outside but none offered menus or even glanced our way . three tables sat open , unbussed while we were waiting . disappointing customer service . we finally walked out because we could n't get anyone 's attention and were hungry . decor is really great , but it looks like they need more management and training .
0	i do n't know where you guys ate when you say `` great service . '' service here is always slow . i come here because the food is great but i 've never felt really attended to . i took my friends here last night and i was embarrassed ! we waited a little over 1 hour for a set of orders and guess what ? they never prepared any of it . we cancelled that and ordered 6 pieces of oysters instead . after waiting 40 min . we cancelled that too and just got ice cream . even that took half an hour . how hard is it to put a scoop of ice cream into a small cup ? ridiculous ! we felt so neglected . we were here 3 hours and only got to successfully order twice ( both in the first hour only ) . there were 5 servers last night and no one offered to refill our water . are you kidding me ?
0	came here on an afternoon for lunch , and the service was pretty fast and efficient since their lunch hours are n't all that busy . their portions are filling , and you have flexibility as to how you want something cooked or prepared ( no butter on veggies , cooked blackened , etc . ) our server was fairly attentive to our needs , and their portions are easily sharable among a large group ( which is recommended ) .
0	we got passes for haze from the vdara front desk so we decided to check it out on a friday . because it was all guys , we left early . we got in line shortly before 10:30 , making our group second in line . within a few minutes , all the lines extended to the stairs . they held all the lines until 11 and then began letting in women and table reservations . the group in front of us had a couple girls and were let in pretty quick . then clipboard man walked up to us and asked how many we had . my friend was in front of me and shouted , `` six . '' my original plan was to divide us into two groups of three but that went to hell quick . judging by the size of his fauxhawk and amount of gel used to cover that abomination , i knew this guy was n't going to want to let us in just like that . he gave us the classic vegas line that they were only letting tables in at the time and it would be a while , unless we slipped him $ 20 each . no thanks , not tonight . he came back once more with the same line but we did n't budge . after twenty minutes , a different guy came over , asked how many we had , and let us in . swag . we used our passes and walked in for free after waiting in line for a little over a half hour , not bad by vegas standards . the interior is dope as hell . it gets crowded quick though . everyone rushed the bar after getting in , making it take a while to order . as far as music , haze is predominantly house music , just like most spots . sure they played hip-hop , but would switch it back to house pretty quick . i felt like a sardine on the dance floor but still had a pretty good time . and you ca n't beat free .
0	dirty . expensive . not owned by starbucks themselves ... they are privately owned which is why they do not accept starbucks gift cards as payment . they did run my gold card through however , since it 's not really part of the actual starbucks company , they did not honor my gold card benefits . they did have some cute pastries ... but those are not your typical starbucks treats . save your coffee addictions for a small business/ privately owned coffee shop instead of these wannabe starbucks . my $ 5 tall sized carmel macchiato did not taste like carmel macchiato at all ...
1	this is the best authentic hawaiian bbq in az . being from hawaii it 's as close to the local korean bbq spots in hawaii . they need to have cucumber kimchi on a much more regular basis though ! i tell the owners that all the time : ) . paradise never disappoints and just wish they had a spot in chandler . i believe it 's the only place in az that serves meat jun which is a staple of hawaiian korean bbq .
1	ok - i have a new favorite downtown ! really great place . makes all the others pale in comparison . cool slide into a shark tank in the middle of the place . and the breakfast was incredible . did n't really win any money gambling , but had a great time .
0	i liked the menu a lot and can tell that there is some serious potential here , but had a really bad experience . they couldnt help the obnoxious , loud , drunk group that came in , so i will give them a pass on that . but when my 1 pound burger came out , the fries were already cold . they seemed like they may have tasted pretty good if they had come out about 10 minutes earlier . unfortunately they also forgot my biscuit until i mentioned it . they then brought it out and it was reallly dry . again , seemed like it could have been better if it had been quicker . again , i reallly wanted to like this place and was hoping to try a breakfast here before i left , but i 'm really not sure i should risk it now . bummer .
1	where else can you catch a sporting event or concert for less than $ 20 ? with lots of parking and reasonably priced food and drinks , this is the place to be to watch all your favorite artists that are not headliners on the strip . i just recently watched the swv and joe concert ... it was well worth it .
1	needed to find a handyman to help me fix up a short-sale home i purchased in mesa . i live in washington state , so do n't know anyone there . received recommendations for handymen from my realtor and a couple other people , but none of them were available the week of christmas when i was there . in desperation i hit the internet and found eli the handyman via his website . best find i could have hoped for ! e-mailed eli , then we spoke on the phone the same day . he was prompt to e-mail a written bid , and was set up to take payment via credit card . nice when you 're from out of town as i am ! eli proved to more than i could have hoped for . he lined up a house cleaner , painter & tile crew , plus he and dana ( his employee ) met me there saturday morning at 8:00 am to get the ball rolling . he took sunday off ( do n't blame him ! ) , then he and his painter worked all day monday ( christmas eve ... amazing ! ) . the rest of the week he worked tirelessly replacing ceiling fans , repairing water damage , installing new doors and more things than i can remember . eli even got me a discount on the paint . i give eli my highest recommendation . he 's ethical , knows how to do most anything , is fair in his pricing and has great subcontractors to call in for specialty work . could n't be happier in my overall experience with eli the handyman . he 's now in my phone contacts , and i will call him every time i need work done . lee ford
1	i saw this divalicious show this weekend , i have seen drag shows before , but i knew them so the experience was different . we arrive at the theater and was surprised to see how cozy and comfortable the venue was . once the show started , the set was incredible . frank marino 's divas las vegas was fantastic . i saw the likes of tina turner , liza minnelli , brittney spears , ( who i thought for a second they were trying to pass a woman off as a man in drag , that is how amazing he was ) celine deon , ( who was also amazing ) diana ross , whitney huston , tina turner , cher , lady gaga , dolly parton , madonna , and bette midler . those i remember . i love , love , loved it . the dancers were awesome . frank marino had so many fantastic costume changes and was so very funny . he did joan rivers as well . all the costumes were amazing ! i loved them . this is one not to be missed . i enjoyed it completely . truly a drag show to see ! the end scene with the man change was incredible . see it ! !
1	clean shelter . affordable vaccinations . friendly staff . quick service . and i love volunteering and walking dogs when i have a chance . one of the best shelters in the world . i would recommend to anyone who wants to adopt new pets , vaccinate , and spay or neuter current pets . you can even get a tour of the place . really cool and caring staff . thanks for everything animal foundation .
0	the last time we tried to go here , the bouncer was not at his post , we walked bye and he quickly called us over then proceeded to eyeball us and give us extreme attitude ! ! ! lay off the juice ! we went in and waited for 15 mins and one came to our table ... we left . i would never go here for any reason ! but girls are drawn to this place , this place and chevy trailblazers ... go figure !
1	love , love , love this place ! the food is amazing , the presentation is so artsy , great variety , the service is great ! note to self , never book a show after the dinner here because 1. will be on time constrain so cant fully enjoy everything they have , 2. will be too stuffed to run to the show once we are late by spending too much time nibbling n the deliciousness .
0	terrible service ... do you ever go somewhere and just want to end it all while you sit at the table waiting ? ? quite unfortunate , however i really have nothing else to say about this experience . we did eventually get to order food , however no drinks which was quite bizarre till it was worked out . we also eventually saw some of the food ... not 3/4 's of it , given the service issues that i may have mentioned , but a few bites here and there . needless to say , we did n't actually eat the food , as it was time to take our business elsewhere . good luck with this place if you choice to waste your money here . with so many other better options within a crawl , i do n't understand how this place stays open ... boo ....
0	is a pretty large storage facility with a lot of different size units . the facility is pretty clean . i use it to store files so i have the smaller unit they offer . people in the office seem pretty nice . my only complaints i have are how much dust gets into the units and how far away it is from my house . they could use better doors to seal out the dust .
1	have i mentioned that i love dive bars ? this is a great dive bar . small , but not overly sticky and dirty . friendly bartenders and patrons . standard beer selection . and there 's pool and other things too . it 's dark and just slightly sleazy . this definitely a good place to kill time , lose some money , and enjoy some cold beers .
1	the rooms are ok but mgm gets 4 stars due to its pool . the standard room has definitely shown its age with a dated bathroom and lack of a plasma tv . but we had an superb experience at the pool . having partied through the whole night and into noon , we wanted to both lay out by the pool and not get burnt to a crisp while passed out under the sun . so we rented a cabana : $ 400 for the whole day -- great deal . the cabana sales people were nice enough to get us one at the producers ' pool , which complete with a dj is very much catered to the what happens in vegas stays in vegas crowd . they could 've easily stuck us at a much tamer pool since we had never stayed at mgm and did n't know any better . there 's another pond behind producer ( academy ? ) that did n't have the sound system hooked up and is more for those looking to purely relax . the lazy river is comprised of families with kids and people who could n't get into wet republic .
1	they have quick reliable delivery . never had a mistake with my order . the bbq chips are amazing ! of the sandwiches i 've tried they are pretty standard , nothing to special , but when you are too lazy to drive and have no food at home you can count of jimmy johns to bring you some food !
0	very rude service , i genuinely felt i that was n't wanted here . the waitress barely said more than 7 words to me , `` know what you want ? '' and `` take a seat . '' the food was okay . i got the lunch special ; the waitress dropped a bowl of soup on my table without saying what it was . no spoon . no refills . too many better places to go in this area to waste a visit here , especially with the award winning carlito 's burritos across the street . oh , and i got food poisoning too .
1	met some friends here after work . while mabel 's is more of a late night place , we still had fun . the swedish meatballs , lollipop chicken and pork belly appetizers were all good . the old fashioned cocktail is a winner . i love the dark , cluby atmosphere and cool music .
0	there are so many things wrong with this gym that i could probably write a small book on its gross lack of customer service and inattentiveness to detail , but i 'll try to sum it up in under 20 paragraphs . pf puts far more emphasis on the customer it 's trying to court than the one it already has . basically , a sell-sell-sell attitude . once you are a member , you 're nothing to them anymore . -i 've tried to get the tv put on to no avail sometimes . pf has numerous tvs and often a big game will be showing where people are doing cardio but where people ( moslty men ) are lifting free weights , we 'll get news or golf . `` i do n't know how to work the tv '' or `` i 'll ask someone to do it '' are popular responses . i 've even been turned down trying to get an asu game on and that 's the local team . disappointing for a gym with satellite tv . - pf has lowered rates for new customers and done nothing for their existing ones . they 've even given equipment away to one of their other gyms meaning you 're getting less for your money . - trainers hold special aerobics classes inside the gym . no , not inside the aerobics room , inside the gym where people work out . it 's not unusual to see people doing wind sprints up and down the hallway or a group of people doing ab work in front of a machine you 'd like to use . -for years this place did n't provide paper towels . if you wanted to clean down equipment or your brow , you had to buy a towel or bring your own . the bathroom only had heated dryers or toilet paper . it now has paper towel dispensers but some are often empty and workers rarely care . patrons here do a great job cleaning up after themselves . - pushing supplements is more important than pushing you to work harder . this location has a very hard time keeping female trainers . women are constantly being hired , but they do n't last long . i 'm told being a trainer there is very difficult because you are not just required to recruit a stable of people to train , you have to sell them supplements as well . pf sells its own brand of supps and trainers will tell you how wonderful they are , better prices than stores , etc . i think the trainers are competent , i 'm told they 're required to sell stuff though and convincing one that apex is better than name brands and much cheaper is not what we want to hear during our training . - loose or damaged equipment is often left unattended . from week to week some of the same dumb bells are loose and i once reported a bent bar on the bench press and no one there cared to remove it . i told multiple employees too . - aerobics classes are subpar and so are the times . some of the classes are titled one thing and then when you get into the class they 're doing something else . i once did a kickboxing class and the girl had us doing wind sprints and some kind of standing aerobic movements that did n't involve punching or kicking . many of their better classes start at like 5 p.m. it 's almost as if their schedule is geared around students . there 's a high turnover rate at this gym too . from the front desk girls to the trainers ( many of the male trainers have been there a while ) to the managers . there 's literally a different manager there every few weeks and the guy who introduces himself to you on a wednesday and says 'if you have any problems my name 's bob , '' will be named steve a few weeks later and mark after that . competitive pricing compared to other gyms , convenience and decent , clean equipment keep me going there . unless this gym is really convenient for you or the price is well below what other gyms are charging , check into your other options .
1	the food is amazing . if you 've eaten at another bianco restaurant , imagine that .... only better , with more options . the service is not great . slow , they forget things , etc . the portions are small . we went on a saturday night and had our choice of inside or outside table with no waiting ... so i think that issue is sort of hit or miss .
0	i was n't impressed . the oxtail chili cheese fries was very good but the miyagi-san 's grass fed wagyu burger and ronin burger were not . both burgers were relatively tasteless and whatever taste was there was interesting . it is definitely not worth a taxi ride from the strip .
0	atrocious ! i 'm a lover of all that is sushi and so when i had one of my common sushi cravings and i just happened to pass by this place , i said to myself , `` why not . '' big mistake . i was actually just going to get take out cause i did n't feel like eating there . so i went to the bar for take out orders and was not even greeted by the bartender with a menu for like 15 minutes ! then when he finally gave me a menu he has the nerve to tell me , `` i 'm running a little bit late and i have to set up for tonight . do you mind just writing your order down for me ? '' at first i thought that was so lame , but being a server myself it thought , `` yeah , why not . it happens . i 'll give him some slack . '' so i specifically wrote down what i wanted and was still very nice to the bartender . he took the paper i wrote my order on and i had to wait . then when my order finally came he got two things on my order wrong ! he did n't even take off his mistake . i was more than willing to not take it with me . duhhh ! it was n't what i wanted . whatever ... this actually happened a few months ago and i can barely remember all the things that i was so mad about because i know that there were more things that i was quite upset about . i was really livid . i 've never been this unhappy about take out in like .. forever ! sushi was n't even that great ! yuck ! overall , i would not recommend it . i would actually recommend against it . no wonder the place is so dead all the time . i drive by this place all the time and they never seem to have too much business .
1	a great garage with a great owner . george goes above and beyond to provide quality service , fair prices , and detailed explanations of what 's wrong with your car . a recent experience demonstrates the honesty of this shop . i had some engine lights turn on and auto zone ran a diagnostic that suggested some larger problems but after taking the car to george i found out that it turned out to just be a dying battery . there is no other place in town i 'll take my vehicles .
0	the two stars are for service only . otherwise , the food does not get stars at all . what have you done , haus murphy ? ? ? i 've been coming to this restaurant since before it moved to its current location . i lived in germany for nearly 4 years , and the food was amazing . i found haus murphy when i moved here and was overjoyed that the schnitzel was very close to the `` real '' schnitzel in pruem , ge . but , someone has gotten hold of the ingredients . perhaps the quality and pride in the food got lost somewhere in all the times the restaurant has changed hands . they have either decided to cut back on good , quality ingredients , or just do n't care anymore . my last two visits left me wanting . as another reviewer put it , the food used to be really good , but now it 's `` meh . '' the only good part of the meal was the mushroom demi glace . that was really good , and covered up the blandness of the dish . the portions have really been cut back , as well . tiny bit of potatoes . no bread basket anymore , unless you pay for it ( way too much money ) , and the dessert was bland and too gooey . strudel crust is supposed to be flaky and crisp ! service was excellent. , however . we sat on the patio , and some moron allowed his two little daughters to run up and down the patio , screaming and dodging in and out of the tables and wait staff . one waiter was terrorized by these brats , as he had to swerve several times to avoid colliding with them . he was nearly tripped with full plates in his hands , but never changed his expression . just carried on . ( people , please teach your children how to behave in a restaurant ! ! ) i know we wo n't be going back . husband was not happy with the amount of the bill compared to the unremarkable food . i 'm sad .
0	i think my lunch salad was made last night , it had no dressing and i waited 25 minutes to be seated . i 'm all set . the only neat thing is every dish is under 475 calories . good concept , but it falls short . really , really short .
0	the food .... the food is excellent . as it was on our last meal there . i was impressed before and i was impressed again with my food . the fish sandwich was cooked perfectly , the bread was crispy yet soft . my side of cheese grits with jalapeno was creamy and not over powered by the jalapeno . my wife loved her farm vegetable plate . i snuck a few bites and had to agree .... tasty . our party was there for 3 hours . i feel like i 'm being nitpicky when i complain about not having my water glass filled , but as my wife has mentioned before ... i go out not only for the food , but for the service/experience . and my water glass was filled once ... let me correct that .... i had to ask for my water glass to be filled 3 times . i do n't know if she was the only server , but she was non-existent . after we were seated , literally 15 minutes before she made herself known just for drinks . other than that , we basically did n't see her except when she stopped by to ask us if we wanted dessert . our food was brought out timely , but it was another 15-25 minutes before we got our drinks until our food order was taken . again , a number of factors could have been involved . it was busy last night , maybe a server called in sick , maybe they were trying to convey a european sense of dining , however , i was so thirsty when we left , i drank nearly a gallon of water when we got home . this place has excellent food and on our previous visit , the service was great . so we 'll go back i 'm sure . this was just an oddity i hope .
1	my wife and i had breakfast here while staying at the wigwam . the coffee was great . we both ordered omelets which were good sized and packed with ingredients . very tasty and a good atmosphere .
1	i love this location ! it is extremely easy to get to and i often find myself here to check out their new styles . the prices are very reasonable and the staff is helpful .
1	john was awesome , very helpful , friendly and honest . came out the next day . affordable pricing , nothing shady . thought my door was beyond repair , he literally brought it back to life . would recommend to anyone who has a problem and thinks there is no hope .
0	this is for the location inside of the mirage . i havent been on yelp in a few to write reviews , so this review is from mid-sept. the main reason i am giving this 3 stars is because of the service or lack of decent service inside the mirage . as always , cpk is good and i havent had a bad pizza yet . on this visit , i had the jerk pizza without onions and peppers , and it was great . price was a little high , but again it was in the mirage . everyone else was satisfied with the food . the server ended up getting on pizza wrong brought out a pasta dish . it took about 10 minutes for the pizza to come back out when everyone was close to half way done . there was no half off or other comp for the mistake . the other issue was is that i paid for everyones pizza with my cc , and noticed it seemed high but didnt think anything of it . when checking the final bill which was lower , the server actually added the pasta dish and charged me but had it removed .
1	i liked their crab legs . i was second in a huge forming line . they are cracked , so no work has to be done . sushi was very fresh . they have really cute bite sized desserts , so you can sample a lot of things . the dessert section is hidden away from everything else , so i think there is a good chance a lot of people forget about it . they have gellato in many different flavors like sour cherry . very cute desserts . i do n't know what kind of dessert i was eating . white chocolate with edible silver balls and soft center . good what ever it was . i am very picky , and i found a lot of stuff i could eat . however for the price , i think i like the bellagio better . their is also a buffet on the stip with circular aquariums at the buffet with tropical desserts that are out of this world . just ca n't remember the name of it : ( i just remember you take an esculator down to get to the buffet . if you love sushi todai is a great fish and sushi buffet for reasonable prices . they have chicken and beef too !
1	went here early * * * sunday * * the food was great/drinks ! the hostess and servers where perfect young and energetic . sat at the large patio great weather !
1	it 's one of those places where they make their own noodles by hand . you the spin then slap the counter with the noodles , and then they pull , bend , pull again , bend again , and pull again . sure it 's in the food court of eaton center in montreal ... however it 's fresh pasta and whatever culture you look at , fresh pasta/noodles just freaking rock . there are only about 8 menu options . noodles , with some meat ( pork , chicken or beef ) with delicious baby bok choi , broth and of course the noodles . for a food court restaurant which permits the owner to print money without putting a good product , i ca n't find anything wrong with this delicious fresh noodle bowl . we 're talking straight up , no-frills noodles but it works . me likey : d
0	their main goal is to upsell you on everything they possibly can ... not care for your pet ! we took our golden retriever for 3 1/2 days , when we picked him up we asked how he did ... the man said 'next time you should really take advantage of the group play time ' ... that was it ? ? as we are leaving we notice there is a 'resident cat ' wandering around with a major butt infection ... my main purpose in writing this is- our poor sweet dog came home with dog poop on the back of his coat ( all crusted in ) and it was not cleaned by the staff -- he either sat in another dogs poo or his own , but he was not cleaned up . our dog is and has been potty trained since we 've had him . the first night home from the `` resort '' he had major diarrhea in our bathroom and it had blood in it- we then noticed he was doing the butt scoot ... ? ? ? seems there are some infections going around there ... shady ! ! ! we will never take our sweet animal there ever again ... they do not care for the animals properly , who knows if they even ever let him outside or gave him water for that matter . beware ! ! ! considering calling the humane society to have them checked out .
0	came here for lunch with some coworkers . the place was pretty packed - we waited about 20 minutes for our food to finally come out . the food was pretty decent . i had the chicken fajita and it was very tasty and made me very full . i 'll try the nachos next time as my coworker had it and it looked fantastic !
1	excellent food and causual atmosphere . we visited as a group of three from portland , or . we enjoyed the quesadilla , poblano chili 's , tomato salad , pulled pork , tamales , and margaritas . the service was excellent and the food was delectable . a friend in portland referred me and i 'm glad she did .
1	my opinion of this best western completely depends on your expectations and what you 're looking for . very reasonable price considering the free breakfast , free wi-fi , social hour , and a decent pool . we arrived with a young child however and they need a little open space which is something these rooms do n't afford . overall .... pretty good , if it was just the wife and i we would return when looking more for a decent place for a great rate . if we we 're back with the kid we 'd pass .
1	amazing company ! the best one in vegas !
0	i stopped in here last night for dinner with my girlfriend . i had been wanting to come here since i randomly caught it on an episode of `` diners , drive-ins and dives '' and last night was the perfect night for us . the outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had . the inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens t.v 's on the wall , a u shaped bar on one side , booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room . my girlfriend and i tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths . the bar seemed quite full for a tuesday evening and our waitress ( the bartender ) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves . after only a short wait , she was at our table taking our drink order . i was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd . for dinner i decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies ( 3 ) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap . our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw . the pierogies were absolutely enormous , almost as long as my hand and fried slightly , topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce . our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined . they tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty . by the time we were done with them , we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist . my sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild . i topped it with hot sauce and like a true pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better . my girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that i took gave me a nice buffalo flavor . the bottom line for me is that i am glad that i came here and might be back again depending on what i am looking for . the food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $ 22 and it exceeded the expectations that i had given to it whenever we walked in . however , with that being said , the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so i would n't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted .
0	we 've been there twice . both times i 've walked away unimpressed . the carnitas in the burritos are tasty , so is the chicken that comes in the burritos . however the overall experience is unremarkable . there 's a salsa bar with several different types of bland salsa . the service , while really polite and warm is very slow . they have good servers there , just not enough of them . i kept noticing both times how my server was working just about every table i could see . as for the cost , dinner for 2 plus tip , was about $ 30 . i can get the same amount of food with meat every bit as tasty at chipotle for $ 14 . considering the premium paid over that at juan jamie 's , especially adding in slow service i do n't think it 's worth it .
1	went in for a stereo and speakers . i was attended right away and it was installed in about 1 hr for a fair price .
0	such high hopes , but alas . the look and feel of the place are absolutely charming and bistro-authentic . appetizers ( tartar and dried meats ) were adequate at best and fish entrees mixed ( one served ice cold ) . forty-five minutes between courses , for pete 's sake ! admittedly this was saturday night , but it did not help to see the fellow who introduced himself as the general manager incessantly texting . al fresco deck is lovely but the interior was super-hot , to the point that cooks could be overheard complaining . with time they may get this right but a ways to go before fulfilling very promising potential .
0	there is a reason the flights are so cheap ... they charge you 100 dollars if your bag is over 50 pounds but they 'll give you a trash bag to put your items in to check and then you do n't have to pay . oh , i guess that extra five pounds really does n't make a difference then does it . why would i put my belongings in garbage bag to get tossed around ? i even to them i was military on leave orders and it did n't seem to matter . awful airlines ... i 'll pay extra to fly with alaska .
1	i love whole foods ! the groceries are soooo fresh and decently priced but the only drawback is the employees ... they 're kinda rude and do n't have much of a personality ... the cashiers do n't hold much of a conversation , they seem so miserable working here ! even though the employees are lame , it wo n't keep me from giving whole foods my business that 's why i am giving four stars ! !
0	clean inside with pretty decor . never busy with great service . the tableside guacamole is devine . yummmm ...... the margarita cheesecake is a straight up hangover cure . the cancun sauce is unique and delicioso ! not the best mexican food i 've ever had , but it has a small soft spot in my heart .
1	the fountains of bellagio . something everyone visiting vegas should have seen at least once . the show takes about 10 minutes , is free and runs every half hour right out fron the bellagio casino . i like it best at night , along with the lights it 's really beautiful , a nice stop while strolling the strip . great photo ops , not to be missed !
0	i would have liked to add this gastropub to our regular rotation given the proximity to our home , but it 's not going to make the cut . we did n't experience anything supremely negative or offensive to provoke scathing feedback on food , service or atmosphere . yet the asking price is just astounding given the quality of all three features . first , service was very friendly . after some confusion with the hostesses about sitting at the community table , we opted to sit at the bar . the large table commonly referred to as a `` community table '' is n't actually a table they will seat multiple parties at - an odd policy . the bar inside was full , but the hostess reassured us that the patio was air-conditioned in the summer and very pleasant . so we obligingly headed outside very open minded about their ability to cool the space on a late afternoon in july . we quickly realized it 's next to impossible to cool an outdoor patio in the arizona summer , and , accepting own naivet\u00e9 , we sat outside anyway . the bartender was very sweet . while i perused the beer list , i kept squinting at the price thinking , `` is this for a pint ? $ 7 ? '' compared to other venues who claim to have a diverse craft beer selection , these brews did n't resonate strongly with me . settling for an api , i then chose the shrimp mac n cheese and a side of asparagus . both were okay , but $ 11 for a tiny pot of mostly sauce and seriously overcooked noodles that fell apart at the touch of my fork ? my husband really did not enjoy his burger which was sort of a mess , but the cheapest option amidst the entrees priced anywhere from $ 25-30 . i started to get the feeling that we patrons are actually mini-tenants disguised as diners . i understand that this remodel must have been expensive and the rent ca n't be cheap , but after paying $ 70 for 2 people , we did not walk away feeling even remotely satisfied . for the same price , you could have an exquisite meal at a gastropub in old town from a creative menu with stellar service ( i.e . citizen public house style ) . for a much lower price , you could sit on an amazing patio and have decent food with a fun crowd ( i.e . ohso style ) . we wo n't risk another subprime experience at such an expense in the future .
1	i 'm spoiled rotten . where do spoiled rotten people go to enjoy themselves away from the privacy of their own home ? the bellagio . it 's one of the nicest hotel 's in the whole world . how many places can say that ? it has more quality diverse dining than anywhere else in las vegas . nothing about the bellagio is overlooked in your stay , the room service is to die for . i 'm so addicted to the bellagio waffle and freshly squeezed orange juice . if you wan na go out to eat you have fix , yellowtail , noodles , sensi , prime , micheal mina , and so much more . i could spend days outside in the pool , it feels like you are in a castle . yummy strawberry mojitos . warm towels and evian spritzers . i feel so much relaxation there , almost a sleep like coma . definitely good for my tan . shopping , shit . if i won the lottery i will move into the bellagio faster than you can say 'congratulations . ' there 's a lifetime of shopping , chanel , gucci , ysl , and so much more ! the rooms here are off the chain . amazing views in the executive suite , the spa tower is large and luxurious . everything inch of this place is grand , fabulous , all around italian palace that still feels like home . watch an unreal show like '' o '' . if you decide you wan na get a nightcap , go to the carmel lounge drink some whiskey or aged tequila . get even crazier at the bank nightclub ! i think i might even get married here someday , i love it that much . p.s look in the bellagio poker room , you might see my boyfriend adam playing . stop bye , have a drink .
1	love it here ! ! ! must try their hot & chunky salsa ! but you have to ask for it ; ) taco 's rock ! ! !
0	i live around the corner . .. and dread every time my teenage says ... can we go to kfc/taco bell . .. the service is the worst i have ever been to ! i will never get the 20+ minutes we were in line ... i actually had to download this app so i say something . please someone hear this ....
0	dont believe the hype ok so the reason i came here was because of all the reviews and honestly this place is not all that . first of all you have to wait for an 40 minutes or more to be seated and the service is very slow . only thing i liked about this place is the hurricane roll ( the extra star is for this roll ) . the fresh was not as fresh as some reviewers said . oh and because we were sitting thing there and talking with friends with have not seen for awhile , mind you this is shortly after we paid the bill , they asked us if there was anything else we needed kinda their way of telling us to get the eff out because there were people waiting . i am sorry but if we were at any other place , they wouldnt make us feel that way . they are never getting my business again . get a bigger spot !
0	it 's a good ole southern home cooking joint on the west side . the biggest plus is the prices . not many places still have dinner meal for less than $ 7 with 2 sides and a tea ( their dinner specials come with tea ) . food is typical . grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough . better off with the fried pork chop . and when i said pork chop i meant super thin cut ones . country fried steak 's gravy was the whitest i have ever seen ... thus a little bland . it reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies . nothing against grannies ( or moms ) , but i have found out in the 2 decades i have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful . but knowing so still does n't stop us from wanting granny 's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter . what is off in quality at gardenia is made up by the `` sweetie/honey '' southern hospitality and down home appeal . it 's a solid spot for a low budget meal . you will be happy if you have the right mindset and expectation .
0	where do i start with this club ... ? first let me say , 935 has been around for years and def has staying power ! this is a club for teens and young adults , like really young adults ! only playing rap and hip hop , ie lil boosie , rick ross and young jeezy . two different dance floors each with it 's own bar and music . vip and table/bottle service available , but they can get pricey and go pretty quickly especially if there 's a major artist performing . thursday is college night , you only have to be 18 to get in but any other night you must be 21. do n't try to sneak in or use a fake id because security is checking and there are charlotte mecklenburg police on site . a major downside to this club is the parking . they 've got one small lot that gets full very quick and they charge a crazy amount of money to park in the lot . if you know the latest rap tunes and looking for a good time this may be your new spot !
1	love this store , whether to purchase stuff or just get some good ideas on how to decorate . the staff is always super nice and helpful and always have lots of great stuff in stock .
0	so i totally should 've read the reviews before i went to lunch today . i wanted to cross off another place on my triple d list so roberto 's is close to my work so i went to check it out . i ordered the el pastor plate which has meat , rice , lettuce , beans , and a tortilla . the el pastor meat was actually good i enjoyed that but the rice and beans were really bland . i judge a mexican restaurant by how their rice and beans are because if they care about those items then there is usually a lot of love in the food . so overall this is just another run of the mill mexican restaurant and it 's in a gas station so no points there either . i will have to go to anthem to try the real roberto 's so i can really cross it off my list .
0	we ordered the mixed seafood platter but found that it had been `` too '' deep fried and therefore too heavy for us . we should have ordered something like a grilled fish . friends of ours rave about this restaurant so we 'll have to try it again and next time be more selective about what we order .
0	i 've given this location a try twice . they screwed up both orders , once giving us a happy meal with an empty box where the nuggets should have been . skip it .
0	we 've been eating here since the place opened about 3 years ago . the food has always been good for counter service diner style food and its usually 4 to 5 stars . never had a problem with quality or value for price . i personally love the pastrami burger and country omelette . the place reminds me of the counter service diners i 've been to in downtown chicago in many ways ( anyone reading this old enough to remember the `` cheeseburger '' sketch on snl ? ? ) . however- service is something that could improve . they seem to go through staff like paper towels . i think that may be part of the issue and its a sign of a core issue in management/ownership . ordering at counter is usually not a bad experience , but i have to agree , that jim 's wife is not a warm and fuzzy person . i have been working in service for the last 30 years and i would n't have lasted that long if i i was n't welcoming and accommodating to my guests . i do n't frequent another area diner at greenway and reems for that very reason- poor customer service . yesterday was my worst experience there ever . it was very busy , which you would expect for 10am saturday . my 7 year old son really wanted to have breakfast there , so despite the crowd , we ordered . every table was full and most were waiting for orders .. i figured it would be a wait , but maybe only 10 minutes longer than usual . i was mistaken , it took almost 1 hour from the time we ordered until our food came . this was breakfast . quick and easy to prepare . 1 hour ? ? ? ? when our food did arrive , nothing was wrong with it , but our server , was obviously pushed to her limits ( only 2 servers working that morning ) . she forgot syrup for my sons pancake and i had to get up and get . no one behind the counter even apologized , even though i was obviously put off i had to get my own condiments . the water i ordered from her never came either . very poor service to say the least . i understand , bad days happen at every job , but maybe they could have been proactive at the counter and let people know how long the wait time for food was going to be ? since you pay in advance here , its difficult to get a refund . and then last night on facebook , instead of posting an apology to their loyal ( an inconvenienced ) customers , they posted marketing pictures of their food . really ? ? maybe an apology with an offer to bring in your breakfast receipt for a discount on a return visit would have been a better idea ? we will return , but you 're on final notice with us jim 's . we want to patronize local businesses , but food alone does n't cut it in this business . you need to provide friendly , expedited service too !
0	typical la fitness . this one has a lap pool and decent equipment . if you want to go when it is n't busy go around 11-3 and 9 to close . from what i seen those times there is n't a lot of people there . i hate waiting for weights or machines to open especially when you have people that keep talking and hanging out .
1	still a fan here ! shop cardenas weekly to get dinner goods for taco night at our house ! this place is close to my work so i 'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats . the selection is still great , and i 've noticed over the months that more and more non-latinos shop here ! good job people ! cheapy like me ! their produce prices sure beat the local albertson 's and vons and smith 's by a long shot . the only other place i get veggies is the asian market but that 's only because those yummy types of veggies are n't found here at cardenas . go ahead , ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears ! you will get a look of confusion . well , that could also be because the stocker does n't understand english very well . in either case , you 're out of luck . cardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your mexican needs . besides the large supermarket area , you still have your juice bar , bakery , deli , and tortilleria stations within the store . the tortillas here are pretty good , i 'm spoiled now ... i only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos ! they taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago . really makes a difference in your mexican dishes . the juice bar is tasty , with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices , or a fresh fruit smoothie . it 's better if you know a bit of spanish because the drink orders can get confusing . got what i thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie , but they for some reason added beets ! tastier than i thought it would be but still , could have done without them . cardenas bakery goes all day long . when you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven . tip , always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens ( usually will be on trays where the ovens are ) . i find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while , and lord knows who 's been touching them or who 's kids boogie face got on them . a sign that says 'please use tongs ' does n't always fit the bill ! i am often here for a quick lunch at the cardenas deli , especially when they run their weekly specials . $ 5 sale for a burrito al pastor ? $ 3 for a ham torta ? often with a free drink ? i 'm there ! i enjoy most of the fare at cardenas , and it 's great they have a free salsa bar to partake with each meal . as of late , they have taken out the sliced cucumbers and sliced radishes that used to be regulars at the bar ... but it 's ok. they probably had to because of food cost , or because of people like me who love to stock up for some healthy snacking ! no problem though , looks like more pickled jalapenos for me ! i am probably there for food at least 5-6 times a month . i love me a torta with a mix of tomatillo salsa and cardenas hot sauce for dipping . muy delicioso ! cheap and easy , that 's my motto . well , for grocery shopping at least . cardenas fits that nicely . if you see me there , come by and say `` hola ! '' i might just be able to understand you .
0	the food is delicious ! ! ! ! oh . wow . yes . the food is a tasty treat . i got the toad in the hole and it 's in the running for my last meal . beer selection is also delicious . i love that they have 5-6 beers on cask . there is enough variety to please beer drinkers of all shapes and sizes . so , why the 3 stars ? oh , because it took 90 minutes for our food to come . it got pretty frustrating watching people sit down after us , eat , and pay the bill as we sat and twiddled our thumbs . we actually did n't twiddle- we drank . and got drunk before the food came . classy . our server was a nice dude- he took 10 % off the bill ... but i 'm pretty sure he forgot to put our food in . ultimately , i will be back because this place is the cutest . i am sure i 'll have a better experience next time .
1	very ono ! we ate kalua pig tacos , huli huli chicken burritos & pulehu beef bowl . makes me feel like home . definitely recommend !
1	you ca n't beat the atmosphere at this place . i bought a google offer for here a while ago and stopped in on a sunday afternoon . there were some people inside but it was n't too crowded . i started in the antique shop wandering around and then made it into the restaurant . i had an ice-cream soda and it was divine . next time i 'd probably split one as the drinks are large . i did n't eat anything but the food looked yummy . i also wandered to the vintage shop next door . it was fun looking around and reminscing .
1	very simple place . i like that when i want indian food i can just come in order and it would be ready with in minutes the price is fantastic and the flavors are very tasty . it is also close to my house so thats a plus . it is very clean on the inside and the employees are very nice . i will be back to enjoy this great food .
1	they were great and helpful . we had our youth soccer shirts done here . they got the shirts to me on time and exactly how i wanted them to be . very affordable and would definitely recommend them .
0	the good news is the restaurant seemed clean , the steak sub was better than expected and the fries , which were requested crispy , were very good . but the reality is i probably wo n't be back . it is obvious that they cut a lot of corners and i do n't eat out to get lower quality than i could get at home . the fettuccini alfredo with broccoli was well proportioned with pasta ( the cheapest part of the dish ) but mainly broccoli stems with 2 florets with what tasted like watered down jarred sauce , the mashed potatoes tasted instant , the soup was canned , coffee was never refilled , service was mediocre and atmosphere was lacking . it 's not horrible , but nothing to get excited about and although i usually have a 'give it two tries ' policy , i 'm pretty sure i 'm breaking it this time . life is too short for mediocre !
0	umm , no thank you . this was definitely the worst eating experience i have had in las vegas . i ordered a club sandwich , which i understand is not their specialty , but i did n't have huge expectations . the sandwich was huge but not layered at all . huge pile of turkey covered in bread , huge pile of bacon , wedge of iceberg lettuce . basically ingredients that you have to assemble yourself . oh and did i mention it cost $ 27 . ultimately had to complain to the manager about my disappointment . annnddd , my friend did get the pastrami which was also not very good .
0	we came here after a failed breakfast attempt at bouchon ( who serves lunch at 10:30 anyway ? ) . yeah , it 's a glorified version of the cheesecake factory . the hostesses seemed bothered that they had to actually earn a living by seating the likes of us ; i actually think that they rolled their eyes when we approached . conversation seemed forced , perhaps some requirement of grand lux ( so , where are you guys from ? ) , rather than genuine curiousity . i ca n't believe the waiter actually suggested the breakfast buffet . $ 15.95 will get you eggs , bacon , sausage , fruit and yogurt * yawn * . after previewing the buffet , i told the waiter that i preferred something 'not so basic ' . i asked his opinion on the chiliquiles and the huevos rancheros . he said that the chiliquiles were good , but an americanized version . i ordered the huevos rancheros . freaking delicious , i tell you . the sauce was spicy and the black beans , onions and bell peppers were a fabulous addition . the waiter was helpful at first , but disappeared before our meals arrived . what the heck ? damn you , bouchon , for stopping breakfast service at 10:30 !
0	this starbucks is awful . they do n't listen when you 're ordering do n't apologize for having to repeat yourself 5 time . their rude and unworthy of my business .
0	nice place , nice atmosphere , and i 've always had good service here but - for me - the bread is mediocre . i 'm guessing they are intending to go for a very moist , 'heavy ' bread , which i 'm sure some people love . i 've just discovered wildflower bread company and their bread is 'perfect ' for me - drier , lighter , but still with moisture and 'stretch ' or 'bite ' .
0	went on saturday night . hit for $ 100 on two separate occasions playing keno on $ 20 worth of betting . all table games had a $ 15 minimum . the place was crowded and it was difficult to get in a craps game or get a seat at the black jack table . it seemed like they could 've opened up more tables to accommodate the players standing around waiting for a seat . the dealers on the whole were a bit shaky with numerous recounts and mistakes made for and against the player . the poker room was packed and again it seemed like the room could 've been bigger for more games . all the bars are cool and different so its fun having a drink at each one . if you order a drink at a table be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes for your drink unless you tip extremely well . i will have to check this place out during the week to see the difference compared to a post-bucco game saturday night .
0	the food quality has worsened a lot in recent months . must be a new chef . almost every dish has less taste and less meat . too bad .
1	so this place was just awesome ! come prepared to spend some bucks though .. we had all the reccomended dishes from fluke sashimi w/truffle oil and capers , softshell crab , garlic yellowtail , soy black cod w/foie gras , baked mussells w/butter aioli . we also did scallop hand rolls and kumamoto oysters ( my wifes fav ) too which is our favorite whenever we go japanese . all i got ta say is they know what they are doing here and you will not be dissapointed they aim to please your tase buds here for sure
0	our service was extremely slow the night that we visited . we waited , and waited , and waited for our food . i tried to give them more of my money by trying to order more drinks while we waited , but our server did not jump at the opportunity to run up the check and get a better tip . so not only did we wait for our food way longer than my patience could handle , we also were left hanging with dry cups for most of the duration of our wait for our food = ( once the food came out i was not impressed with the carne asada . i probably should of just stuck with the tacos . i was very disappointed that i wasted my time and money at this place with all of the other options for great food in vegas .
0	samurai sam 's tries hard at creating some asian inspired food the three of us came here last week , each ordering something different . i had three chicken tacos which were good , but had virtually no meat . as you can see from the photos , it 's hard to find any . lots of veggies though . as for my friends , they each ordered different types of teriyaki bowls . both came with a lot of rice , but again not much else . sadly , you can get nearly twice as much food at panda express . it 's hard to justify coming back , our bill came to $ 24.70 , including two soft drinks and one water . so , two stars and yes , we have had better . sorry !
0	no stars . i took my nye dress in right out of the box . it had a bow attached . when i went to pick it up , they had creased the bow into what i can only describe as looking like one of those chinese folding fans . i asked them to steam it to get the creases out and was told they could n't until tomorrow at 7am because their machines were turned off . this happened at 5:30pm and they 're open until 7pm . i explained i work 7am-3pm . they said they close at 1pm nye . basically they were too lazy to fix the mistake by taking 5 minutes to steam it . i asked them to work with me on their price and was told they could only take $ 1 off . on top of all this , they 're definitely higher priced than polo cleaners down the block on silverado ranch . now i 'm stuck trying to figure out how to fix their mistake on my own dime and time .
0	when our department has to entertain guest speakers or job candidates , the bread company always becomes the default dinner/lunch location . embarrassingly , i 've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit ! my department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants , but the bread company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners : ( 1 ) location . for people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus , this restaurant 's location is unbeatable . ( and since it 's next door to an espresso royale , you can grab a coffee after your meal , if desired . ) ( 2 ) atmosphere . most college restaurants resemble a mcdonald 's playroom for adolescents : neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture , with underlying scents of urine and vomit . while the bread company does have a hint of grunge , it also invokes a strong sense of urban , artistic chic . there are real paintings on the wall ( not poster prints ) . at night , they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting . ( 3 ) price . i think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask . this place is pricey when compared to most campus restaurants , where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars . lunch generally runs around $ 7 to $ 10 , which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests . ( and still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at timpone 's , the other `` nice '' restaurant in the area . ) all of the food is fairly conservative , with obvious combinations of flavors ( brie + portobello , turkey + pesto , etc. ) . i think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests ; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food ( but also nothing exciting ) . the presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality . for lunch , i always go with the egg salad , which is creamy , well-seasoned , and always satiates my craving for egg goodness . in the early evening , sometimes i stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends . the cheese selection is quite good ( you 'll find stilton , gouda , manchego , etc . ) , and the beers are all microbrews ( if you 're into that kind of thing ) . dinner selections include fondue , pastas , pizzas , and some specialties , but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown champaign/urbana . in terms of baked goods , i am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread . yum ! at most places with a baking reputation , i always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies , but i almost never find myself tempted by the ones at the bread company . their treats always look colorless and hardened , as if they were made by an angry grandma . overall , i 'd recommend this to people who like simple , light food . if you are cheap and do n't care about indie street cred , you could probably get the same food at panera .
0	i was never a fan of ayce sushi . even after reading the good reviews about this place , i still was n't interested in coming here since i already had a favorite sushi spot ! however , we had family in town a few weeks ago who asked us to bring them here , so i finally got to see what it was all about . so many reviews here already , so i 'll try to keep mine short and sweet . a few things i would like to point out ..... first , we got lucky with the wait time . they told us we would be waiting about 40 minutes . but because a big party left , it opened up like 3 tables and we only waited about 20 minutes . i thought it was kind of cool that they text you a link that shows your place in line and how long you have waited so far to keep track of your time . second , we unfortunately got a table that was close to the entrance door . it was so crowded and people were waiting inside the narrow entrance way ( as if this place is n't tiny enough ) . i got annoyed because it felt like the whole time , strangers were watching me eat . sorry , but it sucks when you cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder ! lastly , i 'm sorry , but the sushi just was n't that great . i ordered a few rolls , but nothing stood out or gave me a reason to come back again . they may have sounded fancy on the menu , but the taste was disappointing . however , i will say this . their rice to meat/fish/veggies/what have you is great . they do n't pack on the rice or are not stingy with the other ingredients , which some sushi places definitely do . anyway , glad i finally tried it , but no thank you . i do n't mind paying more for sushi that i can definitely enjoy elsewhere !
1	the acts were great ... the type of stuff that you would find making it onto the further rounds of america 's got talent altogether in one show ... with a good variety ... good character cast and some stuff i 've never seen before . paid $ 23 ( tip included ) for a mojito in a thin glass . it was a good mojito and if i was n't a local but just here on vacation i would n't mind , but being a local , i think of all the food that could buy . =p overall the entertainment exceeded my expectations , i was n't sure what to expect .
0	i was hosting a baby shower and ordered food from roberts . every time i called i felt rushed off the phone like they could care less if they had my business . customer service is poor . so i am setting up for the party and notice mold yes mold on the fruit and cheese platter . then i notice that i only have half my order of grape leaves . i called them and wendy walks into the party with a replacement platter . by that time my guests knew there was an issue with the food . how embarrassing ! i agree with a past post that they are a bit rude at times too . they may be known for their cakes but i would steer clear from the catering . never again
0	this was bad pizza . i ordered a large pan pizza with a greek salad last night for delivery to my hotel . i ate one piece and had a terrible taste of yeast or something in my mouth . the dough was the heaviest or densest dough of any kind i have ever had . the pizza must have weighed 10 pounds and was 90 % dough . the sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce . two hours later my wife arrived and i told her not to eat it and throw it all out . that was a $ 35 pile of yuk . i had a belly ache and diarrhea all night and half a day .
1	good peruvian food . granted i 've only tried a few places , but my bf is peruvian and we both agreed this place was legit ! we ordered the arroz con pollo ( chicken and seasoned rice ) and the anticucho de lomo ( beef kabobs with sides ) .... two popular peruvian dishes . both were yummy . i really liked the peruvian rice ... and the kabobs were very tender and tasty ! ! it 's worth the drive and experience . on the flip side , i did feel the dishes were a bit pricey for what they were . however , i realize peruvian food is hard to come by here .... thus , rarity comes with a price .
0	if cab number 546 pulls up , wait for the next cab ! ! i have never experienced a more reckless driver in my life -- speeding , violently switching between lanes , jerking the car around . we asked the driver to slow down , and his response was that if we did n't like his driving , he could turn around and take us back to the hotel ( of course he turned around to say this us , and we had to ask him to turn around and watch the road ) . he then proceeded to drive unreasonably slow in the left lane , despite other cars honking at him . to make matters worse , over this course of this ride , our driver ate an ice cream , finished a couple bottles of water and was on his cell phone ... terrifying .
0	this review is just based on walking through to get to marquee . this place is very nice on the outside . on the inside , it 's a little dark but nice and spacious as well . it was very crowded on a saturday night .
0	wow , lots of hate on here about this place . gave me second thoughts about coming here , but we had coupons . service was very good . food was reasonably good , but that 's kind of what you expect from a chain . i had the chicken under a brick , and it was just fine . i did n't care for what my mom got ( chicken scallopini , i think ) , but she likes that . my wife had the eggplant parmesan and enjoyed it as well .
0	i am a big fan of a few things : gin , men 's boating shoes and mainly , pedicures . i get pedicures probably 3x a month , i 'm a junkie . i 'm a big fan of the `` asian '' run nail salons , especially around this area . however , charlie 's just plain sucked . the place was n't clean , the pedicure was weak , the `` design '' they did on my toes was n't worth $ 5 , and the woman doing my pedi did n't even stay in the lines , i had to come home & clean up the magenta splotches on my side toes . one perk ( sole reason for 2 stars ) is that they did that razor dead skin thing ( which may or may not be legal ) and i think anyone willing to deal with that deserves 2 stars on yelp . all in all : too much competition out there to give crappy pedicures ... go down 1 block to another cheap nail place .
1	a new japanese / sushi place off ft. apache near trop . a nice , quite and very spacious place , with great friendly staff . had the saba shio yaki dinner plate . plus , i added the prawn and vegetable tempura for $ 4 extra . i also tried a spicy yellowtail roll ... amazing ! ! will be back .
0	must have been an off day but still pretty good . better luck next time !
0	my first q'doba experience also happened to take place in madison , wi where i would visit a good friend of mine while living in the chicago area . this was back around '99-'00 or so , i believe , and i 'd never experienced a chipotle to compare it to . i really enjoyed it at the time , so much so that when i moved to michigan i would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one . i was pretty psyched when the one on rural opened up out here because chipotle never sits right in my stomach ( not that it necessarily stops me ... but i always dread the impending doom that eating there brings ) . unfortunately , this was n't exactly the q'doba i remembered , and it 's just sorta average . i like the chicken , but the steak is blah . queso is ok , but i 've had much better . this is the one place where i actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa , and i like the hot as well . no salsa complaints here . i usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at chipotle , which consists of three tacos , a drink , and chips and salsa ( queso at the q ) .
0	not a big fan . somehow have been here 3 times for lunch and each time it is just mediocre . i keep ordering the sushi lunch special and it 's just never that great . this last time , it was very slow at lunch and it took forever to get our food . i probably should just give up on this place . i do n't know how i managed to eat here again as i told my co worker on the way there that i did n't like it . hunger addles my brain .
1	my daughter actually dragged us to this place , that alone was a miracle that she liked a place sooo much to take us there , lol ! the place is nice `` mom and pop '' feel to it . when you first walk in , it looks like a little take out place . then , you look to your left and you see this adorable patio type dining area . very pretty old world decor to it . i felt like i was in mexico eating . my son did n't know what to get , so he asked the waiter what he recommended and he told us the # 8. so my son ordered it and loved it ! the menu is n't huge but there is plenty to choose from . salsa was delish ! the only downfall is that if you are planning to go with a larger group , more than maybe 6 people , you might have a problem getting a table . definitely worth checking out !
0	the restaurant itself is beautiful , modern , and has a great space for private parties . i had the chardonnay by the glass and unfortunately thought it was overpriced for such a brassy finish . i was excited for the green gazpacho and the presentation was fantastic , but i was confused by the addition of minced almonds which kind of texturally ruined an otherwise extremely promising starter with a nice kick . the texture confusion continued with the main course in a gnocchi that was gritty , along with it being under seasoned . the flavor profile and presentation were excellent though . again , overall , nothing was bad , just mediocre . if you 're trying to impress a date with food , just go to isabela up the street . if your date is more into decor , go here . they both have the spectacular view .
1	so i usually have a good experience here . the chefs are very nice as they were today , but if you 're not at the sushi bar the service is much slower when it comes to the sushi . overall not bad , but could have been much better service .
0	it 's a decently good sized store with lots of cheap stuff that is almost fashionable . there were lots of people in the store and people buying quite a bit of clothes . not certain why i ended up dropping dough but somehow i felt like i just needed to have something new to carry around and bring home i guess .
1	usually i 'm a starbucks girl but the iced chocolate coffee i had was delicious ! i look forward to trying more things !
1	do i look electrified ? i should because i was shocked at how much i enjoyed a meal here . in town for a couple of days and wandered over to station square and decided to drop in here for a meal . i 'd eaten here once before and it was unmemorable but figured it was worth another shot . sat at the bar where i received fast and friendly service . my glass of club soda was never empty , which i appreciated . i ordered a pasta dish and it came out looking like a kraft mac n cheese reject , but then i tasted it and it was very good . the sauce was nice and spicy and the chicken was tender and moist . they talked me into the brownie sundae for dessert and like a strong wind , it blew me away . okay , so this is n't fine dining but if the food is good , the service is great and the price is reasonable , then that means four stars in my book .
0	service is a negative 5 .. atmosphere is 5 ... paul wells , the one man band is great ..... service on the other hand was the worst i have ever seen .... i was never offered even a water or a wine or beer or a cocktail or a cigar . . heck the food & beverage management from orange sky restaurant ( kieth ) came down to talk with us regarding my situation . he did offer a free round of cocktails that we kindly refused . after that he offered a free appetizer at the restaurant we had reservations for the next night . while walking to the restroom at the end of our night i saw the server and at that point asked her name . she said it was michelle . . i then asked why shy never offered us any type of service ? she did not respond .... i then asked `` do you not like us for some reason ? '' we are a mixed race couple . ... her response was a very big obvious smile and walk away ... is shadows racist ? ? ? ? are the sunday night wait staff racist ? ? ? if not , we felt they were ....

0	is the food good ? no . is the service good ? actually , yes . on monday night my 3 friends and i had several margaritas ( because they 're 1/2 off ! ! ) and dinner there . the bartender was very nice and the drink was appropriately strong , and the table waiter was also very pleasant to 4 of us . the place was not that happening on this particular night - i think it 's partly because of the holiday emptiness the college town experiences + ultra cold night - so no body was kicking us out of the door in hurry . we stayed and chatted long after taking care of the bills , and they did n't seem to care . has the food been authentic or anything close to that , the dining experience would have been a bit more pleasurable on palate , but over all , not too much to complain about .
0	a friend of mine highly recommended stockton dermatology , so i called to schedule a check up with dr. stockton after finding a strange new spot on my skin . i also wanted to have an overall exam , since i had never been to a dermatologist before . the staff said that there was not an appointment available for 2 months . i was worried about waiting so long since i had something i needed checked asap , but made the appointment anyway . when i showed up for my appointment 2 months later , it turns out i was scheduled with a physicians assistant , not even dr.stockton . she was absolutely horrible . i had several areas of concern , and she had no idea what any of them were . i also wanted to have a small skin tag removed , and she said she i would have to come back for another appointment to do that . i scheduled the next appointment , but when i found out that it was going to cost $ 600+ to have a small skin tag removed , i cancelled . i had a horrible experience with this office .
0	this place is not the grind , zinburger or even delux burgers . not even close . the owner thinks it is but he should at least try these places and then upgrade the beef and the preparation and the knowledge of the service . only then could you possibly justify the prices ! please get a clue , i live a block from here and old really appreciate the grind ii not another amaccapanes ! !
1	smashburger is my absolute favorite . i think it 's equal to in-n-out , if not better . i suggest the sin city burger . worth the pay ! ! ! !
1	this is some of the best food you will ever taste . the service is excellent ! ! ! no need to run down the list of their dishes i have had everything and its all done to perfection ! ! from the prices to the portions this guy knows how to treat a customer !
0	went here yesterday to get our sushi fix after a nice day of hiking icebox canyon . our party of 6 was famished and was quickly seated for lunch . it was n't very busy as it was a weekday and we were having a late lunch . `` the sooner i can sit down , the sooner i can get started on stuffing my face ! '' is what i say . i know it 's difficult to have a large party go for ayce , but when the staff forgets about what you ordered and constantly have to be reminded of it , you know there 's some organization issues in the back . there were a couple of dishes that did n't even make it to the table before our check did . regardless , it was a good start , but the staff could n't handle our giant appetites towards the end . some notable dishes we had involved fresh fish and good flavor combinations . their maguro ( red tuna ) was excellent that day ! i 'm normally a fan of salmon , but the nigiri to order was the maguro . the redder , the better ! i also really enjoyed their spider roll ( a classic ) and their double d roll . the double d roll was listed under their shrimp tempura special rolls and had great intermingling of flavors along with a little kick at the end . it was one of our favorites ! another plus was that they do not pack on the rice ! now on to the not-so-great dishes . the shiro maguro ( albacore ) that we ordered came seared when we were under the impression that it would have been raw . upon eating it , you could definitely taste a distinct fishiness , which should n't be the case if it were fresh . they also topped it with what tasted like the garlic sauce they usually put on top of garlic tuna . since this was my first time here , i was n't sure if this was their norm to sear the shiro maguro . i honestly think this fish was on its way to going bad , so they needed to serve it but mask the extra fishy flavor . another one that was n't so appetizing was their super white tuna , which is n't listed on their menu but somehow had it when we asked for it . it was a little disappointing because the freshness was n't there . there were a couple of other nigiri that just did n't cut it to my expectation of freshness , but these two were the most distinct . i would like to see this business succeed because the ambiance , decor and cleanliness of the restaurant is excellent . the staff really has potential to excel ! our server was very accommodating and attentive , but unfortunately the lunch staff in the back could n't accommodate our large orders . i probably wo n't be back unless they make some changes to their organization and quality . p.s . if you 're in a bind for choosing your dessert , get the green tea mochi . it appears to me that it is homemade and you really taste the yummy green tea flavor ! you wo n't regret it !
0	this panera ( gosh , they popped up everywhere ) is standard panera i 'd say . smaller patio on the sidewalk and not the most inviting of patios in the small strip of a larger shopping area with lowe 's and walmart . i usually find someone will come and smoke near you if you sit outside here for a little while ( must resist the urge to slap the person ) . usually clean but have found the internets here a little slower than other panera 's . bagel 's are pretty good but get chewier as the day progresses and i do n't usually make it to a panera until the evening . find the food to be a little pricer for the same fare as jason 's deli or mccalister 's but always pretty fresh and good . love the chicken noodle soup though , my favorite ! !
1	this place usually serves restaurants and depanneurs but anyone can go in ; no membership required and the selection and quality are better than any crummy costco . shop with your room mates or with a bunch of friends and save yourselves a bundle . even if you just want to purchase small quantities of certain items for yourself it 's worth the trek . best buys are cheeses , pasta , cereal , spices , anything you can think of for a party and frozen stuff including pasta and veggies . for canners and pickles it 's a paradise . i ca n't believe it took me so long to write a review of this place - it is , quite simply , the hidden gem of st-henri .
0	what can i say . disappointed ! ! very disappointed . especially after reading the yelp reviews . i did a lot of research on where to eat in las vegas . i did not want to pay the $ 200.00 plus price tag of some of the top top rated places , but , i am a foodie and wanted a memorable meal . first , my partner and i had a reservation , and were seated at an extremely large 4-6 top table ( i usually appreciate a big table ) however , this was completely impersonal . by the way we were eating at 6:30 p.m. so it was not crowded . we asked for another table and were seated at a banquette . the server arrived , but acted as if he was not expecting company . the best experience was with the sommelier , whose name unfortunately i can not remember . he gave great recommendations for glasses of wine and even brought tastes for my partner . he was very friendly and nice to talk to ( more later ) . my partner ordered the kobe beef burger and i ordered the san francisco cioppino ( imagining that this would be stellar given michael mina 's roots ) . the burger was terrific , the fries however , were over salted ( i am a salt lover , so really too much ) and frankly pretty ordinary . now to my cioppino , first , it was obvious from the first bite that the fish and shellfish were pre-cooked , no , really . i could not believe it , also , the temperature of the whole dish was off . the `` broth '' which is actually more like a tomato saucea was not hot enough , too thick and just bland and ordinary tasting . the combination of the pre-cooked fish and shellfish was really not good . i only ate the lobster tail and the scallop ( also not cooked correctly ) . the sommelier came by towards the end of the meal and asked how everything was ( the server never returned to ask ) . i asked him if he really wanted to know and i told him about the above . i saw him tell the server , who never asked us and just brought us a trio of sorbets ( the chocolate was yummy but the peach and mango tasted like sharon 's . ) overall , i would never recommend this restaurant or eat here again . i was glad to take the complimentary copy of wine spectator with michael mina on the cover , but would be reticent to try his restaurants again .
1	i have never been to a dry cleaner before and have heard horror stories about how they smell funky , lose/ruin your items or just plain screw up . this was not the case here . the store is located in a new shopping center next to some lunch destinations , so it seems a little out of place , unless you drop off/pick up during your lunch hour . the inside is nice - it 's clean and new . everything is automated and seems well organized . the two different employees i interacted with were nice and informative . the entire process was simple and efficient . it was so simple and easy , my husband said we should dry clean everything - until he saw the price . luckily , since it was my first visit , i received 25 % off my order . if i ever need something dry cleaned again , i 'd definitely stop here .
0	i was elated when this place first opened up used to look forward to going there for brunch the food was great even though they were inconsistent with their dishes and the service was not up to par but as time went by the food got worse . they started getting cheap on the ingridients . the location and decor is really nice and the outdoor seating is a plus . that 's why the two stars . i have to say since being disappointed a few times this place just pissed me off ! this place is cut !
1	wow - i was totally impressed with chris and his crew . we got in everywhere we wanted to go - communication was easy and fast . my cousin and i had a great time at the palms and foundation room . i 'm sure i 'll make my way back to sin city and will definitely hit up chris and his team before i go . thanks guys ! ! ! ! !
0	if i could give a negative star rating i would . i will say that i have had 4 previous experinces with 2 stylists who were great . they were patient with my 3 year old and gave him a great cut . then today happened . like the other reviewer stated long wait time , stylist looked at us and walked into the back room . when she finally appeared i wished she had stayed in the back . my 3 yr old sat for the trimmers but started to cry when she got the scissors . i kept looking at his hair and something was off , i finally realized she went over an inch too high with the clippers and it was uneven in the back beyond repair . how do i know this , my parents owned and operated a salon for 20 yrs , i spent many days after school sweeping hair ! when i called out her mistaked she claimed it could be blended . finally another stylist came over and had to give her instructions on how to fix it . that tells me she is an inexperienced stylist . she continued to make it worse , now my son is in full meltdown and if she moved any slower she wouls be stopped . i finally told her to buzz his head . then she refused to clean up his neck and trim his ears all the while saying it was his fault she did an uneven cut with the clippers . really we blame 3 yr olds ? she continued to argue then stomped into the back room . i packed up my kids , some 20 something mgr appeared and while she was asking what happened stylist 2 chimed in . at this point i an livid and yelling . long story short they jacked my sons hair to the point it had to be shaved , never once said sorry and continue to blame it on him . i left without paying . the punch line , i called my husband and told him the story and he asked me what she looked like . i described her and it turns out that 3 weeks earlier she cut my husbands hair and jacked it so bad that when he walked through the door i burst out laughing . it was probably his fault for moving.lol i will never be back an will tell everyone with an ear to avoid this place like the plague .
1	excellent value , exceptional quality . absolutely the best ayce sushi in las vegas . we 've tried the others , but nothing compares to s21 !
0	disgusting . typical cheap , dirty , greasy americanized chinese food . clean your damn restrooms ! chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli . hot and sour was pure barf . dark .
0	i took my car into the dealership to get the first oil change ( new fr-s i bought in february ) . i also mentioned that the air pressure light would randomly come on but it was no longer on and the tire pressure was fine in all of the tires . the service staff member carefully looked at all of the tires and also stated they look fine , no noticeable issues with pressure , and he did not see any nails . he said they would change the oil and look at the tire pressure light issue . about 45 minutes later he approached me in the waiting area stating that there was a nail in my tire and that they took it out and tried to fix it but then they realized it was a little close to the wall of the tire and they could not repair it so i needed to purchase a new tire . then he handed me an invoice for almost $ 300 for one new tire . i explained to him that i did not authorize anyone to take the nail out of the tire and asked him why they would do that without first consulting me ? i did not authorize such work in the service agreement i signed . i have never had a situation where a service shop would do something like that without my consent . i explained to him that findlay 's actions were not authorized and that i am now being forced to purchase a new tire which sounds a little like a scam to me . his response was that if i did n't purchase a new tire they could put the spare on for me and send on my way . i asked if the spare was a true spare or a donut and he said he would go check . about 30 minutes later he came back and guess what ..... all of a sudden the story changed . seems the service guy did not take the nail out after all and he is just going to pump the tire up and put it back on the car . without even getting into how much of a scam this is , i told him the tire was not flat , or even low , when i brought it in so i do n't understand why the guy had to `` pump it up '' . he had no answer for me . i fully believe this was a scam to lead me to believe that i had to buy a new tire . had i not questioned the actions of the service and blindly took them at their word that the nail was removed , they tried to fix it but after it was out they could n't , i would have been forced to spend $ 300 on a new tire for their unauthorized work . to further my belief that this i a total scam , only after i refused to blindly pay $ 300 and questioned their actions did it come out that in fact they had not done the work they originally claimed to have done . i do n't know if it was because i was a single female and they thought they had a sucker on the line , or if this is status quo for findlay but either way it is so wrong . i got my car and i left . at that moment they lost me as customer and forever lost my recommendation .
1	food streats across from the el cortez was amazing ... so many people , live dj 's , cool booths and great food trucks . i had the fuku karai spicy burger and it was really good ! soft , spicy and yummy ! ! i also enjoyed the thick fries ....
1	went here for a friend 's b-day was very impressed with the meal . i had the ny strip steak ( $ 45 ) which was 3 big slices of steak ( cooked to a perfect medium rare ) , a wilted greens side , and also some new potatoes ( they were boiled , then fried , then smashed and brushed with butter and were freaking amazing ) . the table shared the spicy onion rings ( good but not $ 12 good ) , creamless cream corn ( not sure how it 's made , but it was really damn good ) , and both steak and duck skewers ( the duck was my favorite but both were good and decent sized ) . the prices are on point with most steak houses , and the entrees actually come with sides not just a la cart like most places . there was a ton of staff , our water glasses were constantly filled and questions were answered immediately . my only complaint and what is preventing them from 5 stars was their bread basket . it was 4 very hard , very dry basic dinner rolls , which was kind of a let down , but then again if the bread basket is the only complaint i have with a steak house , the place is n't all that bad !
1	service was great , thin crust pizza awesome and good red wine for $ 8 per glass . one pizza feeds one person for 13-20 cost range plus drinks and a salad or appetizer . the creamy mozzarella plus pesto was excellent and enough for two to share for $ 11 . food quality , service and atmosphere are far superior than a pizza hut or typical pizza place and yes you pay more ! i would recommend to them a kids pricing menu with games for $ 5 range and a family feeds four couple of pizzas and salads and appetizers for around $ 40 . wayne gorsek
1	mac n cheese was damn good . homemade bleu cheese was even better . service was a little weak , but overall the dive bar/ lounge atmosphere and great beer selections are solid . wish they would expand the menu
0	always have had good experience here but not tonight , dinner with group of friends had abysmal service . first waiter forgot our table and second waitress had a poor attitude when asked about very late food . food was ok but definitely not as good as in the past .
0	i hate to give a bad review but there is simply nothing much to brag about i 've tried this location 3 times and only came back for the second and third time hoping that it would get better but it just doesnt do anything for you right , the food is n't very well seasoned the only only thing that 's worth even bragging about is the strawberry shortcake everything else is just plain humdrum nothing special does n't leap out at you it has a name & catchy touristy gimmicks but other than that it 's not worth the price
0	i had eaten here about a year ago , after being out late . their chinese soup was delicious . we had heard about their 777 special ( steak and shrimp for $ 7.77 ) so we decided to come back for lunch after a unlv graduation . the waitress was terrible . i wish i could remember her name so i could warn other potential patrons . she took our order , checked on us once and then never returned until we asked the hostess for our waitress . we were parched the entire meal . a few of the other entrees we ordered were , an open faced turkey sandwich ( good ) , cheese pizza ( gross , no flavor ) , breakfast plate ( my daughter go sick afterwards ) , and the 777 special was ok. i do n't think i 'll ever return .
0	this place seems perfectly fine as you peruse the grain section . then i strolled through the produce section , which really should be the pride and joy of a store like this . the produce section is the core of a healthy diet - and this is a health food store . however , the blackberries were a little wrinkled . the salad a bit brown . i thought however i scored by getting 2 for 1 on avocados . they were not mushy , they had good color . when i cut into them at home , they were moldy and spongy and black and disgusting . all of them . gross ! ! ! i now wonder if i should eat the buckwheat from their shop - can buckwheat go bad ? ? ? they also had dr bronner 's castille soup which i love . their bottles however where cloudy . i have never seen a cloudy bottle of dr bronners and i have seen a lot of them ( they have it at trader joes in san francisco where i used to live ) . these bottles must have been there for years ! i am not going back there - for anything . it 's like the owner forgot he owned the store and never comes by . it is neglected big time ! yuck !
1	i love roberto 's and this happens to be right by my house so i come here all the time . the food always comes out fast and they always get my order right . this location is old and the decor is dumpy ... but i do n't go to robertos for the ambiance .
0	it 's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside . from my short visit it 's apparent their main clientele are transient .
0	after being asked by a fellow yelper to elaborate , here it goes . we approached the hostess and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair . when she jokingly said `` no '' i laughed and proceeded to ask for a menu to which she again replied `` no '' ! i guess this was her attempt at humor , however after the first time , it seemed to have lost something . by the way , she never really indicated that she was joking . so , $ 50 , 1 ceasar salad , 1 spinach chicken whatever salad , a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples , and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight . oh , in between sitting down and paying the check , the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold , soggy burrito and rubberized tenders . the waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled . while i understand we ate at an airport , this is unacceptable . next time i 'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before i waste a meal here . they 'll be hearing from me soon .
1	this place rocks my world . where to start ? the studio itself is absolutely amazing ... it 's like walking into a spa . there are four separate classrooms . three are heated and one is not . hot pilates and bootcamp are held in a large room and they can get pretty packed later in the day , but i think that makes for a highly energized class . trx , kettlebells and battle ropes are held in a slightly heated room but you barely notice it . the trufire , power flow and truyin are held in the highest heated room and you get an amazing sweat in while increasing flexibility . yin , ashtanga and vinyasa classes are held in a non heated room and it 's a beautiful relaxing atmosphere . you can tell each teacher truly loves what they do , and they want you to have the best experience possible . i ca n't even pick a favorite because they are all so absolutely wonderful . they each bring their own vibe and energy to the class so it 's always new and exciting . everyone is so friendly and accomodating and eager to help . you absolutely can not beat their prices . their class schedule is amazing ... sometimes the hardest part is trying to pick what class i want to take at a certain time ... this place is an absolute dream !
0	tooling around vegas late at night one is left with the conundrum ... do i want to spend $ 40/50/person+ and expect great food ( being disappointed with anything less ) , or do i spend less and take a major roll of the dice that my dinner might be better fit for a dog ? deciding that at least if a buffet is n't that great , you can still really fill up , we found ourselves on line for a couple minutes before entering this buffet at the flamingo . selection was decent , but hardly huge , and even the dessert area , while taking up a lot of space , did n't really have that much variety to offer . do we really need 25 feet of `` sugar-free desserts '' ? the drink service was annoying to say the least , as the soda hardly tasted right , and the servers rarely paid you any attention . why no open area to get your own drinks ? the food itself ranged from marginal at best ( lobster bisque , pasta ) to forgettable but decent ( poultry dishes , other seafood ) to fairly good ( green beans , fried rice , beef dishes ) . the desserts were hit and miss as well . in the end , for $ 25 a person , this was right on the edge of tolerable . one could fill up on pretty decent food , and that was the saving grace . however , i 'm sure it far from the best buffet or best deal available on the strip . it was essentially the hand we were dealt , and at least we did n't lose our shirts .
0	kobe beef tacos ! ! ! ! melts in your mouth , literally . the tacos came with a pineapple salsa that i didnt think was gon na go good with it but they made the tacos and i usually dont like fruity salsas . girlfriend got the chicken enchiladas and they werent that hot ( good ) . it had a pablano puree and it wasnt that tasty and didnt go with the enchiladas . the staff was really good and friendly , the server knew a lot about the courses and how they were prepared . ambiance was , eh . personally didnt really like it . all in all , i would go again but would be scared to venture the menu and would stick with the kobe beef tacos .
0	was there last saturday afternoon . not many people in the bar . music was way too loud ( or am i just getting old ? ) . disappointed that the only healthy option on the menu ( an appetizer of chopped veggies and low fat ranch ) were n't really served with low fat ranch . and the steamed veggies with my meal were loaded with butter , although the prep notes only mention `` steamed '' to make me think it 's a `` good for you '' choice .
1	service was great . we had to wait for our table but they quickly took an order from us at the bar for appetizers and drinks . the menu had plenty of choices and the food was excellent ! great atmosphere !
0	so i decided to order food from them for lunch for myself and a coworker . the ordering was easy enough and i was told it would be here by 1215 ordered at 1140am ... i though sure not a problem ... it got here at 1230 ... after i called to ask what was taking so long . no apologies or nothing ... if you say your going to be here at a specific time show up promptly ! it 's my lunch hour ! it was shortened thanks to you and your employees who do n't give a damn . 23 bucks for 2 half sandwiches and small salads after tip .. shoulda ordered something good for this price . i got the turkey sandwich and it was rather forgettable . i do n't think i will be ordering from this establishment again . shoulda just got in n out .
0	nice room . stayed here for 3 nights . early checking cost $ 50 extra . better than napping in the parking lot with wife , baby and mo in law in our tiny honda insight . not many places to plug in all of our chargers for cell phones so we took turns and used the restroom plugs . check in line was always long , with not enough staff to handle it ... check out was a mad rush too . vegas was n't very busy this time of year . end of march . parking was free . the ipod dock did n't charge the ipod and it had the wrong time . they had a fridge and safe in the room . no coffee pot in the room . the checkout was kind of weird . i suggest an easy checkout . get the folio under your door and just walk out if there are n't any problems with the bill . we ended up standing in a 30 minute line just to check out . good job ti , but i think for the price , i might stay somewhere else .
1	parking for viva chicken was a super hassle . ugh , i did n't have any coins for the meter and then i had to install some app on my phone and then create an account and the whole time i 'm hoping a meter maid does n't come by . okay , enough unrelated nonsense . viva chicken is right across the way from the presbyterian hospital 's main lobby entrance . inside dining and outside on their small patio . order at the register and pay , get your drink filled and then your food 's brought to you a bit later . i chose `` the great '' sandwich - a good portion of pulled chicken with the usual lettuce and tomato on a toasted ciabatta roll . it was excellent . the chicken was nice and moist with a good flavor . for my side , i chose the sweet plaintains which were perfect . plump and juicy and really flavorful . a great sandwich , i 'll hope to be back here again !
0	i could n't be more frustrated with this facility . we went here to avoid that big gym feel and this place is equal too or worse . first do n't get sucked in by the pool because the kids pool or slide is not open often enough or during times you could use . the lap look is always booked or full so if you want to take the kids swimming this is n't the place . they have a cool rock wall but no one is there to let you use it . the kids area is not appropriately staffed and the check in process is very insecure . say you decide you do n't want to use the gym anymore ? good luck canceling . you jump through loops designed to stop you from canceling and still they misplace your file and harass you for the bill you canceled . at $ 92 a month you can get alot better . avoid at all cost because i 'm still dealing with their billing mistakes .
1	mary ann martin has just moved to luxe salon studios . mary ann has over 30 years of vidal sassoon training and provides professional hair styling services at a reasonable price . men , if you want to get away from clippers , and have your hair actually cut by a professional , you wo n't be sad the next day ; when you look at your old cheap clipper cut and wonder why you ca n't find someone to professionally cut your hair . my wife uses mary ann for cut , coloring and styling which mary ann provides as well , but men you need to give mary ann a try . you wo n't be disappointed .
1	the food is pretty great diner food . however , the last time i was here the waitress whistled along to the song `` pumped up kicks '' . i now hope it gets struck by a meteorite .
0	the `` security guards '' are seriously the biggest dicks ever .... the parking is horrendous and they actually tow their own employees out of the designated employee parking . go to south outlets ... at least you know your car will be safe . security calls the tow truck drivers to tow their own people ... what the hell ? they are rude and no offense , but if there really was a serious situation that would happen at the outlets , they would be the first to segway outta there and leave you stranded and helpless .
1	vodka flights . caviar flights . both awesome . try the german caviar ! if you want to go extra fancy , they have an ice room ! did i mention the vodka from all over ?
1	after reading the reviews for this place , i decided that it was worth trying as we were checking out the venetian anyway . i got the kobe burger which was really good ! the meat was nice and juicy and the fries were crispy and crunchy . this came with shittake mushrooms , caramelized onions , and a side of togarashi aioli . the bf got the italian grinder which i had a bite of , and it was really good as well ! prices are about $ 12- $ 15 average for entrees , which i think is a good price for the food and relatively quick service considering how busy it was .
0	no longer serving food : / and not a huge selection of smoothies ... still nice to take advantage of a smoothie after a vegashot ! class .
0	ok. so i 've been eating at the location on 7th ave my whole life . decided to try the northern location . hmm ... upon entry , it looks like it used to be a chinese restaurant . knowing los compadres is n't exactly upscale , the food is what i expected and i love their beans as i always have . the salsa is different than the 7th ave location ( at least it seemed to be ) and i found that a little disappointing . the service ... was less than stupendous . `` are you ready ? '' `` do you know what you want ? '' oh and my favorite ... '' do you want your check now or what ? '' . not , would you like dessert , are you ready for your check , would you like a box or anything like that . completely rude . so . i 'll eat there again , but i 'll get it to go .
0	i come from a turkic background and i look the part so naturally i was greeted in turkish by the owner ( i think ? ) . i 'm thinking ok this is going to be a great place , very authentic . boy oh boy was i wrong ! mom had the lab kewab , and i had the chicken . priced very reasonably but i would have been willing to pay a bit more if that means that they can produce a high quality product . mom said her meat was chewy and hard . i tried a piece and i agreed . my chicken was bland and had a weird texture . the rice which is usually so so tasty at middle eastern/turkish restaurants was so lackluster . sorry husnus but this food was not authentic in any way .
0	i purchased a brand new fridge from them that was discounted due to 2 small dents in the door . the fridge was delivered and i thought all was fine . several hours later i returned home to a flooded fridge compartment and kitchen floor . turns out some of the fridges with water/ice dispensers they have in the showroom have filters in them - some do n't . in my case , there was no filter in the fridge when it was installed . when the ice maker kicked on , since there was no filter , the water just poured out of where the filter should be - hence flooding the entire fridge and leaking out onto the floor . i went back to the outlet and explained there was no filter and was basically told some have them , some do n't . since mine did n't come with one i would need to buy one for $ 50 . i spoke to the manager as this seemed ridiculous . the manager walked around the showroom , found a fridge that had a filter in it , removed it and handed it to me . i was grateful ... until i got home and it was the wrong size ! ! ! ! i called the outlet and spoke to the same manager who said there was nothing he could do , i 'd have to go to another parts store and buy one . i went to the parts store the next day , with the wrong filter in hand . the man there was extremely helpful and was shocked how the outlet store handled the situation . he looked up the model of fridge i had and agreed they had given me the wrong filter out of some random fridge . he gave me the correct filter free of charge and said he would charge it to the outlet store . i will never buy another appliance from an outlet store !
1	being in vegas for 5 days is not for the faint of heart or the wallet . so this time around , i opted for saving as much as possible and pocketing the extra cash ; so i did my research online and found restaurant.com gift certificates to use in vegas . and this happened to be one of the restaurants featured . time : my bf and i visited this place the very first day we landed in sin city and to our disappointment , it was closed . they are only open for breakfast and lunch , i believe . we were needless to say , a little disappointed and hoped that we would be able to use it . so we opted for the next restaurant.com location , raffles caf\u00e9 just a few walking minutes away . food : so we finally got to try this place on our last day there . let me say , it was well worth the wait ! i ordered the steak and eggs . it came with a nice size steak , three eggs , hash browns , and 2 slices of toast . it was an ample amount of food and cure to my hangover morning ! my bf ordered a lamb `` philly-steak '' sandwich on french roll . it came with fries that were lightly seasoned with something and it was heavenly ! i kept finding myself reaching over to steal them every once in a while . this place is a must , must , must visit ( with the restaurant.com gift certificate , of course .. unless you win big and do n't mind the splurge ! ) our originally $ 45 brunch , came out to about $ 22 ! when you think of it $ 11 for each person is probably one of the greatest deals you 'll get for the amount and quality of food received .
1	amazing nacho fries ! intelligensia coffee . awesome , friendly servers . and big juicy burgers . this place is soo good ! my friends and i had a great time here . the wait was short and the food was fantastic . we will definitely come back the next time we go to vegas .
1	sticker . sticker . sticker . sticker shock when i saw the bill ! thank goodness it was n't my turn . lol . everything was good . it 's in a decent location , to where they can change you premium solely for location , but it 's definitely a delight . everything was delicious . the service was exceptional . would definitely dine again .
1	ok , so after a few visits to this place , i figured it 's time to update my review . i do n't classify myself as a sushi connoisseur by any stretch , so i would say that does n't qualify me too well to review this for people who are . with that said , if you are new to sushi , and want to find what you like , this place is a good choice . i only wish i could get s steak with my sushi . and maybe a baked potato and a salad . : )
0	the segara boregi was absolutely delicious ... that being said , i expected more from the lamb and the chicken kebabs i ordered . it was n't even the fact that it was n't on a stick , it was the portion size . for the price i payed i expect more than 2 ounces of meat . basically i payed $ 9 for a bland portion of rice . the only reason i would consider returning would be to fill up on the appetizers .
0	it 's a kool spot i guess .. but i 've been going there for a few yrs now and the staff is great but the food is good at best but not great and this place is slowly getting worse .. bathrooms are never clean if you show up at 7am but wish them well but i 've given more than enough money to this place and its not getting better .. sorry guys
1	anna 's is fantastic , and pretty much can alter anything you bring in . i have brought multiple pants there ( dressy and jeans ) and have never had an issue with the final result . i have also had a few dresses and skirts done as well . on top of that i brought my wedding dress in to be fitted . i bought my dress as a sample so it needed multiple alterations , as well things i wanted changed ( taking off some beading ) and they also did the bustle- which was difficult on the dress i had . i could n't have been happier with everything they did ! although with specific employees some of the things i was saying was 'lost in translation ' but usually one of the younger girls was around to clarify what i was wanting . i will always bring my items to anna 's
0	thomas street tavern has a great atmosphere and is really a very cool place to go to but the prices are definitely not cool . i went on my birthday a few weeks ago and was pretty disappointed in the drink prices and the bartenders . they were really not very friendly and would n't even recommend any drinks to us . definitely a great atmosphere but not worth the $ $
1	barriques on monroe has always been one of my favorite `` office work '' spots . as a person who works from home , the free parking ( next street over ! ) , outlets galore , great wifi connection , tasty coffee and mediterranean plate keep me coming in ! but now -- - with the new space , so clean and bright , i 'm completely in love ! everything i 've ever enjoyed about barriques but with a face lift ! there is now a nice bar area to enjoy a beer or glass of wine and i feel like the tables are less cramped .
0	this will be short and sweet ! this walmart is always very busy . its clean and fully stocked . cheap prices but every time i go its an experience .... i mean it 's walmart so i got exactly what i expected .
1	having stayed at there other property the venetian i was anxious to try the palazzo . since is newer the venetian is seem cleaner and more modern . great rooms the casino is a little smaller . the staff is fantastic . beautiful decor throughout the hotel , check in was a breeze . i had such a good trip i stayed there again two weeks later and also had a great time .
0	i tried a slice of lemon cake ; it tasted very artificial ... kind of pinesol-ish . definitely not homemade . i also tried a few cookies that were ok , nothing to get too excited about .
1	oh what a terrific restaurant this is ! on this second visit ( for me ) i was joined by robyn n. , & i ordered what i suggest you try for your first visit , a carne asada torta norte\u00f1a with salad for the included side . ( skip the chips & order a 99 cent side of their delicious ceviche if you want a little something more . ) what you get here is stellar everything ! it 's a clean , it 's comfortable , the service is friendly & attentive , the food portions are generous , & the prices reasonable . you will leave full , & having just eaten some of the best food you have ever tasted ! yum ! ! : - ) ) carne asada torta norte\u00f1a $ 7.49 .
0	blah ! this was my 2nd visit to bravo , 1st time i got a grilled chicken salad & had to send it back b/c the chicken was pink . this time we started w/ the sangria rosa , way to sweet & was more like a daiquiri . i got the chicken caprese & the chicken was very thin & like rubber , i could barely cut it , the orzo had zero seasoning . so disappointed & we will not be going back ! only reason for 2 stars instead of one was because we had good service .
1	the caley sample room is a gem in the western side of edinburgh , with a loyal local following and plenty of folk who travel a way to get here . the food wins awards , the beers and drinks are varied and plentiful and it has the best table water in edinburgh ( stuffed with mint , cucumber and whatever else they think will help ) . the architecture 's a little odd , but that probably stems from its previous life as part of the nearby brewery . the exterior can seem a little uninviting and unfortunately it lends itself to smokers clogging up the doorway , but the pub opens up once you 're in . the restaurant to the right has plenty of covers , set around heavy wooden tables that bring a feeling of tradition and quality . to your right is the rest of the pub , with a long bar that stretches into the distance . good for a quiet midweek pint , or a busy friday night , they host regular live music nights and other special events . the staff know they 're stuff about the menu and the drinks on offer , which is all you can ask . fortunately i 've always found them friendly too . it 's well worth your while calling in to the csr if you 're in the area - near fountainbridge , the canal , gorgie farm and the other delights of this side of town .
1	i am a fan of culvers , but this location is not as awesome as the ones in minneapolis and wisconsin . however , good service nonetheless , excellent burgers and mmm culvers frozen custard . it just ca n't be beat .
0	omg ! finally ! a pizza shop that does n't charge $ 8 for a head of lettuce and a hand full of veggies . the food is pretty good and very affordable . the only problem i have is that my workplace puts in a $ 300+ order every friday and they never throw out any deals . not that they have to but it would at least show that they value and appreciate their customers ' business .
1	this is a great place ! my first time in a couple weeks and loved it ! reminds me of matro 's steak house . i think these guy were some of the prior owners of mastro 's . we had a table of four . crab bisque for the starter . the steaks were perfect . crab cakes were great ! the lobster mac n cheese was good . the cream corn was great ! service was very good ! he was attentive but not too much . not aggressive , humble and friendly service . just how i like it ! the bar looked like a good place to hang out . highly recommend this place .
0	do not eat here . they changed my tip and charged me $ 28 for lunch . absolutely ridiculous .
0	i came into this office tonight for an abscess tooth . i have had a few so i know the difference . the pain is unbearable and your gums form a pocket after you have had a cavity for some while . i do n't have insurance and i do not have 50 or would 've went to a dentist . let me add i came in for antibiotics , not hard core pills . let me say this place is horrible ! after claiming i have gingivitis from the female doctor on staff at 7:30 at night to not giving me a prescription because i would n't pay 50 is basically holding it hostage . i could understand if i was trying to get vicodin but an antibiotic ? the lady in charge of billing kicked me out ! i will be going to the director having a law background i know that umc has a sign on the wall stating that they will help everyone . what they 're forgot at the bottom is anyone with money . by the way already at another hospital and have been seen and what so you know i have an abscess tooth , not gingivitis . you will have to pay a copay if they find you as not an emergency , which gingivitis would be considered as not an emergency . the nurse there who has blonde hair i will be writing the director for her because she belongs in a way better environment . gingivitis is where all your gums are inflamed and your gums are bleeding .
0	i wanted to love this place , i did n't . solo dinner , sat at the bar and that was my mistake . food was amazing ; fillet oscar , creamed spinach , brussel sprouts , bread pudding . there were three bartenders behind the bar providing service for five of us ..... i felt completely ignored , to the point i spoke to management . they do n't know they have a problem if no one speaks up . he knew it was bad . he talked to me for at least ten minutes , the entire time both my coffee and water were empty and no one did anything ! he finally said something to the bartender , and admitted he was embarrassed and sorry . i am guessing the dining room is different . i say again , food was amazing , i will be craving that creamed spinach !
1	food is ok but service is good , i mainly come here to watch the football game and have a few drinks tvs on every wall with different games going on and the patios big screen it 's awesome .
0	i was recommended this place by a friend who went to asu . we were n't super hungry so we decided to share a southwest burger . the burger was decent , nothing to write home about but it was n't disappointing either . my bf got really weirded out by the texture of the chili but that 's him . the highlight of the night was the sampler . my bf really enjoyed making his way through the sampler and getting a chance to try all the different beers the brewery offered . i could n't try it but i enjoyed how happy it made him . the environment was pretty fun . no ac in the building though which kinda sucked in the hot weather . not sure if i would come here again , it 's just your average brewery .
1	so las vegas - i am not a virgin let 's just say . i think i have stayed at most places on the strip with the exception of a few and planet hollywood was one of them . so when we planned a little unemployment vacation ( yes myself and three other family members are currently without full time employment ! ) i decided to book a room here . i have to tell you i loved the vibe . it was very fun , young and the music just made you bop your head wherever you were in the hotel ! my family and i have a routine - which some will think is funny but oh well . we rate places on a few criteria - 1. the pool , 2. how big the room and more importantly the bathroom is and 3. can we do everything without leaving the hotel for the entire stay ? i would say planet hollywood gets 5 stars for this ! we all loved this place - the mall is an extra plus for the restaurants as we all know the casino restaurants are not cheap . our room was very nice - clean and it slept all 6 of us ! ! lol . the pool was fantastic and we even had a star sighting - ashanti was lounging by the pool right next to us in the vip section . pool waitresses were very friendly and kept the drinks coming . i would say the only thing was the pool temp - it was a bit cool but with hot weather i am sure they figure we can deal ! ! overall our stay was great - the staff was friendly and we had a blast . i even hit a straight flush on three card poker ! whooo hoooo ! ! !
1	we are doing low-carb and the salads here are very good ... the ahi salad is very good , and my husband enjoys the cobb ( no blue cheese and avocado on the side ) he gets ranch , and it is quite tasty , and i get the avocado , yay ! have you had ahi down the street at hank 's in gvr ? sadly , or wonderfully , the ahi at sierra gold far surpasses the ahi at hank 's .... for many $ $ less , go figure ! the beers are cold , and the service at the tables is good as well . not too much , not too little ... we usually see the same servers so they know us , but tonight we had a new server and she was equally as attentive , and got us our happy hour beers before the end of happy hour , so of course ... we were happy !
0	another raw food restaurant in phx . yeeehh ! it has a wonderful atmosphere and decor in a quiet shopping center in the northeast . the menu is limited , but the items are tasty . good fresh plates of green veggies with nuts and seeds made to order . the guacamole is delish ! very tasty onion crackers ( it 's named onion bread on the menu , but it 's dehydrated paper thin and wo n't hold a sandwich , plus only 2-4 triangular pieces are served with the meal ) . my two points of criticism are : 1 ) the desserts are over priced - $ 10 for a small slice of cake . i 'll try it once , but not again . 2 ) too much oil on the meal - with so many nuts and seeds , no oil needs to be added . will eat there again in the far future .
1	we very much enjoyed our dinner here but will echo what another writer said , which is that the meal goes very fast ... almost too fast . i wish they would leave another minute or two between the courses just to give folks an opportunity to truly appreciate all the fine favors of the dishes . the chefs move so fast and announce the dishes so quickly , that some of the meal felt like a blur . the only other suggestion i would have would be for them to do a bit more of the preparation in front of the diners instead of just the plating . some of the various processes they talked about sounded really interesting , but we did n't get to see that aspect of the preparation , which was a bit disappointing . i expected that they would be cooking in front of us , not just preparing the final products . other than that , the food was spectacular and the service was outstanding . when we asked questions about the various dishes , the chefs were more than willing to explain how the dishes were made . i wish they gave more explanation up front , but i guess some diners are more interesting in the process than others and the chefs are just trying to keep everyone happy . unfortunately , we had some real duds at our dinner - four guys who managed to be late for dinner and then showed about zero interest in the meal . i could n't believe how rude these guys were , especially given the cost of the meal . but the chefs were gracious and did n't seem to mind all that much . all in all we had a wonderful dinner and definitely recommend the experience .
0	-this location is closed due to a fire-was disappointed to find a boarded up front entry here today , website says it is closed `` indefinitely '' , but there are several other locations in montreal .
0	mom came in by ambulance on friday with a fractured femer on the left leg where her prior hip repleacement from 2005 had taken the hit from her fall . the old hip was removed and a new hip with a longer leg shaft was inserted . she has been out of it for several days but wednesday she finally walked and thursday she was more herself again . the food has been good for hospital food and the nurses have been wonderful . no one enjoys waiting around the er or waiting for tests and all of the other things that happen in a hospital . but this is a very nice facility and staff . and believe me with dad having a stroke and various surgeries and mom being the $ 6million woman with this her 6th major surgery i have experienced lots of hospitals !
0	i 've been to three different sushi bars since i moved to vegas a month ago and this is easily the worst . the california roll was barely passable for more than something out of a vending machine . the other rolls were very bland . i do n't feel i should have to add soy and wasabi to get flavor from a roll . there are much better choices than this in the same surrounding area . maybe i just went on an off-day , but with the variety , i wo n't be back .
0	would not recommend this place to anyone seeking good seafood . we started with crab cakes that were sub par . my husband 's steak and prawns were weak . the steak was not sirloin quality and the shrimp smelled and tasted badly . the manager was kind enough to knock off about $ 8 for his meal , but the plate was so bad the entire entree should have been deducted . my snow crab legs were good , but the side veggies were not . they had a strange lemon flavor which does n't normally accompany green beans and zucchini - which was over cooked . squishy zucchini is never good . overall our only positives were the side salads . the restaurant itself is also very dark , the lights never seemed to get brighter . our server was pleasant but very slow . the place was not that busy so we are still not sure what took so long for the food and check to arrive . we wo n't be returning .
0	holy schlamoly ! this place changed . the first time i came here back in 2004 it was a brewery . it was cool , it was fun , it was affordable . the beer was good and made there ... fast forward to my last visit in 2010. it 's a lot more ... douchy . i 'm not sure what made them make such a drastic change . the place used to smell of hops and malt ( which smells like burnt wet oatmeal if you have n't had the pleasure ) . now , it 's just like any sports bar on the strip . gone are the tanks , the smell of brewing beer , and that brewpub feel . and it is freaking expensive . unless you make it for happy hour - which unfortunately we were too early for . i talked this place up and was sorely disappointed by the changes . i really had no reason to come to the monte carlo other than this spot . we had to walk through that hotel/casino that smelled like old lady perfume . i had such a headache after that adventure . my advice - avoid this spot if you are looking for a unique place to have a pint . or , if you have to go , go during happy hour .
0	i know urbana is supposedly the artsy-fartsy birkenstock side of cu , and so , while i understand why art coop would elect to move there and into the creepy old and largely deserted lincoln square mall , i just miss their presence on campus . ( doggone it , when i was a fine arts design major , the coop was conveniently located on campus and staffed by some of my quirky classmates and i felt at home inside the coop . now , not so much . : / ) the prices are not great , definitely higher than dick blick . and the assortment of weird and wonderful papers and tidbits also seems to have dwindled . frankly , it 's just as easy and more price effective to shop on line for the run of the mill basics . i miss the old school art coop . : (
0	very friendly staff . sucks you have to pay for wifi . room decor is outdated . the water pressure in the showers was really bad .
1	if you are looking for an new optometrist or need new glasses , please check this place out . the entire staff is very friendly , professional , and helpful . there is an small yet perfect selection of frames , so it does not feel like a glasses factory . i care about the earth and this place is one of the few in the area that carry eco-friendly frames from eco and drift . i highly recommend the establishment and will go no other place for my eye care . thank you to all the staff at eyecare plus . keep up the great work !
0	i wish i read the other review before i decided to go in . ) = they got me with their `` receive two services for free '' flyer from the mail . i paid $ 42 for a brazilian wax , eyebrow wax and underarm wax ( i got eyebrow and underarm wax for free ) which i did n't think was a good deal at all granted the quality of service which is no quality . i 've paid more or less the same amount for all three services in the past before tip at regular price . i 've been waxed all over the country ( most of them in l.a. ) and i have to say that european wax center gave me the worst waxing experience ever . their employees were super nice , but you can tell that they 've been overly trained and are literally speaking off scripts . they also tried upselling me everything from overpriced products to purchase of membership and future services . that just takes the personal experience away which is very bad because body waxing is already uncomfortable enough so the environment should be personal and warm . it also bugs me that they did n't tell me exactly what `` european wax '' meant before getting me naked . it 's a no strip wax which only dries at certain room temperatures so it was chilly in there , and there was nothing they can about it like turning up the heat because the wax only dries in cold temperatures . i asked for a blanket or towel and they could n't even provide that . once the wax dries , it hardens and they pull that off . the wax they 're so proud of could n't even handle taking off the fine hair so they had to go over every area at least twice . that 's not only painful , but also ineffective . i asked the aesthetician , aja , how long she 's been waxing and she said `` less than a year '' . i did n't have to ask her that ... i can tell she 's inexperienced . not only did she leave ingrown hair , she also left a bunch of hair behind . i would 've insisted on having it corrected so i can be completely bare ( which is how wax hair removal should always be ) , but she already went over every area at least twice so i was in pain . she was careless , heavy-handed and paid no attention to detail . stray hairs were left behind everywhere and my eyebrows are now uneven . there is no way i would recommend this establishment to anyone , nor will i ever be back . i 'd rather go natural !
1	definitely a good place to walk your dog or go for a little jog . they have a whole bunch of different trails and little benched areas you can sit and just watch the sunset . i love how they have doggy bags throughout the trail and little bathroom stops on the way . a lot of people i see here are taking pictures and others are biking or with their dogs . it 's a pretty nice area to just go for a leisurely walk . the only downside to this area is that there is a lot of flies and mosquitoes in the area . beside that a fun place to walk around
1	great food , superb service , wonderful menu . my go to place for an elegant date night ... as yelp says `` yay ! i 'm a fan . ''
0	after all the hype about hakkasan i could n't have been more dissapointed . the club is definitely nice , and the djs great but the service was horrible . i have never been to a club were the security and attendants were so rude . my friends and i were able to get a table from a promoter which was awesome at first . because we were getting a table were told we had to be there by 10 ( about 4 hours before calvin harris went on ) after standing in various lines and multiple check ins we finally got in the club - and to the table . however 20min in a security guy came up and told us that the 2 guys who were with us ( 12 girls ) who had just paid $ 100 each were not allowed to sit at our table ... i saw another group being told the same thing , unless you specifically paid for your table , guys were not allowed , which made no sense . 30 min before calvin harris came on , another security guy and another man with a clipboard came up to our table flashing flash lights and demanding we leave - we were not allowed to sit at the table and had to move - they were yelling at us continuously telling us to move with absolutely no explanation as to why . after arguing with the man and demanding he at least tell us why we had to go - he told us an owners friend had bought out the table and he had to give it them 'or else he 's lose his f * * * * * * * job '' as though it was out fault . i know that this is not unusual in clubs , to be asked to leave a free table ( given by promoters ) when someone who can afford to buy it comes along- but the workers their were so rude about it , as though we had snuck into the table and stole their alcohol . after leaving the table we went down into the crowd which was so crowded my friends and i were literally stuck in the same position for 10 min , absolutely unable to move , at the same time the bottle service attendants are shoving you from behind - i remember asking one of them , who was carrrying a large stack of cups to a table to `` not push me '' to which he responded he 'll `` push me if he has to '' and then did . another friend was repeatedly yelled at and threatened to be kicked out because she was leaning against a surface close and kinda connected to the tables - her back was turned to the dj and crowd and it was clear she just needed somewhere to sit for bit in addition , water bottles ( 8oz fuji waters ) were $ 8 dollars each , a redbull was $ 9 - as they made us get their 4 hours early because we `` had a table '' we all sobered up pretty fast - which meant you had to spend i cant imagine how much on drink from the bar .. which costs a lot ! overall , i would never go back here - the club itself was definitely cool , but the workers there all seem to be on power highs from working in the `` hottest '' club in vegas , its just not worth it - i have been to las vegas multiple times and to a lot of different clubs but have never experienced such arrogant and pretentious servers and security . - they literally ruined our night i would recommend surrender , xs , or any of other clubs ! they 're cheaper , less crowded , still have great djs and actually treat you like customers not uninvited guests . if you 're not ready to drop 5k on a table , chose somewhere else to go .
1	this school has been an amazing part of my daughters development ! ! ! ! we thank roy , kathy and the rest of the staff of ccm for all that you have done for us and alessandra ! i would hands down recommend this school to anyone !
0	ordered steak and blue salad -- definitely not impressed and do n't recommend . tasteless with ground up steak bits , barely recognizable as meat .
1	i had a kitchen sink leaking and i called precision plumbing . dustin rush came and did an amazing and thorough job . he was very personable , friendly , and helpful . in addition he installed a new reverse osmosis system for me . everything is running great and i 'm happy ! thanks dustin !
1	the best vintage shop in champaign ! scott and amanda are always up for a chat about mid-century furniture , and are lovely people . furniture lounge is simply the best shop to go to if : * you are redesigning your home and need furnishings , lighting , decor * you are trying to find a unique gift for a friend or relative * you love thrifting , antiques , or vintage * you love mid century modern design * you want to look at something interesting and beautiful ! they recently started taking credit via square reader in their new downtown champaign location .
0	ordered chicken fingers and fries on special for $ 5.95 . the chicken fingers were the kind of chicken you find in a $ 1 mcdonald 's chicken sandwich . the fries were completely tasteless . no salt . for the price , jack in the box or farm basket is much much better . will not eat here again .
0	great buffet . i think i gained 5 lbs before the check came . i just changed my mind and took away a star cuz i remember the steak or whatever meat they were serving was not that good .
0	my friends and i went to vegas this past weekend for one of my friends 22nd birthday . we clubbed hopped and ended the night here . in order for us to get into xs we first had to go to tryst to get a stamp because they were n't having a guest list at xs . we got here and waited in line . there were like 5 check points within the line and we had to get our ids checked at every single one and get stamped , do they not trust one person to check ids ? my friends definitely wanted to go to xs because afrojack was playing . i wanted to go because my sister said it was a nice club . we got into the club and it was super packed . it was so hard to move . i was so irritated because the people that were there that night were so fucken immature . my friends and i were standing in a crowd and then people rush on over to the section we were at and start jumping , screaming , and pushing to get to the front . while they 're doing that , you got the security in front of the crowd pushing everyone back . i 'm stuck in the middle being pushed forward then being pushed back -______- all the other clubs we went too gave us free drinks , xs did n't . my buzz was killed from all those people who were pushing especially this little asian girl . i 'm asian and the asians that act and look like her make me not want to be asian , they make me embarrassed . we did n't even get to go outside to check out the pool . i 'm going to give this club another try when i am back in town . hopefully it is n't as crowded and has classier people .
0	i would love to tell you about all the great things i discovered at this hotel ... but they cancelled my reservation ? what ! ? what ! ? that does n't happen ! but it did . yesterday i made a reservation for two nights : even gave them my credit card info and received confirmation . today i get a call telling me they `` actually do n't have those rooms '' available for two nights . the person i spoke with did n't even apologize or offer to put me on a cancellation list ( like other hotels offered ) . very odd , very odd .
1	5 stars is based on one 2.5 hour visit so far , with a friend on a sunday morning in january . coffee , food , and atmosphere were excellent . my 16 oz . pour-over coffee ( $ 3 , ethiopian , filled to the rim ) was smooth and good enough to drink black , which i never do , though part-way through some bitterness showed through and i added some half and half . ( my favorite pour-over is probably songbird . ) friend had an iced vanilla honey latte and had high praise for it . we both grabbed strawberry muffins ( $ 3.50 ) and liked them ; they were moist without being too much so . atmosphere : very comfortable ; it was easy to have a long conversation here ; the floor to ceiling window has a nice , peaceful view . clean ; simple ; modern . wifi slows as it gets more crowded , which is to be expected . parking is a hassle , but i 'll be back .
1	our room faced the bellagio shops which was absolute torture . i 'm pretty sure when i die , heaven will reappear in this exact form ( chanel , prada , louis , dior , tiffany 's ) . so when my friend told me she was considering purchasing a prada bag , i almost died ( of envy ) . so we went into the store and the sales associate charles punzal was the absolute sweetest . he was patient and pulled practically every color option of saffiano leather totes we asked for . definitely made the selection process a lot easier on us , and we left with the most gorgeous , black purse . would recommend coming here and asking for charles to help you out if you 're thinking about making the financial plunge into timeless happiness .
1	i took my car in last week for a regular check up . very pleased . came back today because my poor little tercel 's rack & pinion was dying . work done on time . no problems so far , i 'll check back if there is . both times i went in i noticed that the customers waiting were happy- coming and going . good customer service ( especially with new guy up front , the owner was swamped before he got there ) . they seem to get a lot of repeat business . i am very happy with them and will be going back : - ) i only give 4 stars `` just in case '' - i never give 5 stars for that reason . it is clearly an established shop in a prominent location .
1	excellent fresh thai food . do not let the looks of the outside of this place fool you .
1	from the us perspective i think there 's a lot of hype surrounding l'express because it was written on a couple of short-lists of must-eats in mtl - probably most notably in nyt . pre publicity it seemed like a great place to know to eat , a wonderful bistro with all the trim - indulge in anything , enjoy a cigarette between courses and lose your concerns in a great meal . indulge in everything but self consciousness . the food is very good - reliable and delicious over years . authenticity may wane with acclaim here ...
0	customer service was bad enough that i feel compelled to write a review which i have never done before . the plumber came out and repaired the problem but left our water shut off at the house valve , no big deal really , but when we called in to see why we had no water and the repair was completed ( even though the plumber never notified us he was here ) , and wanted to see if the plumber was on his way back and the receptionist was extremely rude . she told us that the plumber had left the water off because that was how he found it . mind you both my roommate and i are off today , have used the water today and neither of us knew where the valve was or we would have turned it back on . this is where super receptionist comes in and tells me `` what do you think my guy is a liar ? '' multiple time to which i finally responded `` yes , yes i do ! '' it was a very simple fix , once she told me where the valve was i flipped on the water and life went on , but beware , if their guy messes up at all you will get defense secretary of the year on the other end of the phone .
0	this place sucked ... the service was terrible , only went because my niece raved about the place . we got there and waited almost 20 mins . before we saw our waitress , the food was pricey for what seemed to be everyday mexican food . but the service was just terrible ... i was not impressed at all .
1	this place wins the coffee shop favorite of the area . gianni ( the badass barista ) is phenomenal at making a high quality drink . he 's doing a great job teaching the other two owners how to work the espresso machine to its best potential . the environment is welcoming , eclectic , and comfortable : workspaces on the left , lounge on the right . the stage filled with mics , drums , and turntables is what brought me back to this place , and the ping pong table in front is probably the best idea i 've seen for a coffeshop with so much space to use . this is a great place with great product run by great people .
1	if you want to commit suicide by soda and sweets , come here and get your supplies . rocket fizz is a great place to find odd sodas and candies that bring back childhood memories . i visited a similar little store in st. george once , so finding one here that 's bigger and better is awesome ! if they have the jelly belly strawberry jam soda , grab one . they 're goooooood . great prices , a plethora of soda to choose from and great candies . i love the fizz .
1	`` a tall drink of brunette and a bugs bunny special '' a week ago my parents sent me a birthday card . enclosed was a check and short note : 'it 's your birthday . do n't behave . ' i 'll do my best , maw and paw . i worked late that cloudy monday of march , and after work i stopped to get my crown vic 's oil changed . then i went to the bank , then to the car wash , and then proceeded to drive around in a funk . did n't want to go home , did n't know where to go . was n't up for the strip , was n't up for one of my regular watering holes . i had n't told anyone it was my birthday so i was free from required appearances . so i drove down 215 , windows open , music off . i saw green valley ranch hotel/casino in the distance . it had been a few years since my last visit so i decided to stop in . after parking on the top floor i strode through the massive doors . the casino floor was pretty empty . typical for a monday at an off-strip casino . i plucked a twenty from my pocket and stuck it in a wheel of fortune machine . no lie : i sat there for over an hour on the same twenty . made it up to 95 bucks before watching it whittle down to nothing . no matter . i might be a lot of things but hard up for cash was never one of them . it was around 6 pm and i was hungry . i kept thinking of my parents ' request not to behave so i decided to drop some major deniro at hank 's . i walked in , found a seat at the bar , and stared at some ncaa basketball . a word about hank 's : it 's expensive , tastefully decorated , sanguine . here 's a look : http : //greenvalleyranch.sclv.com/dining/hanks/ ? utm_source=yelp & utm_medium=social & utm_term=gvr & utm_content=gvr-properties & utm_campaign=gvr-yelp not a lot of seating , great wine selection , pretty servers . as for the latter , mine was a tall drink of brunette . wondrous curves with tresses to match . what a masterpiece . i asked for a glass of red rock and looked through the menu . all sorts of interesting and pricey selections . the decision : crab cakes to start , dry aged bone-in ny -- medium , mac and cheese . i gave tall drink my order and she moved like a swan to fill it . in the meantime , i sipped my drink , watched the games , and smiled at tall drink . enter crab cakes . kind of on the small side , one with a small garden atop , some yellow sauce beneath . i wish they had been larger with more sauce but they were good . not too dry , not too moist . enter steak and mac/cheese . both were too salty in my opinion . the meat was correctly cooked and had good flavor . but too much salt . the mac and cheese had a fantastic cheese taste but too much salt . i guess people must like their food salty but i 'm not one of them . nevertheless , i did like dipping my meat in the cheese sauce every third or fourth forkful . such an act would likely cause gourmets to pass out but i do n't care . and despite the sodium content i did manage to temper its power with some good old black pepper . i ate every crumb and asked for a dessert menu . easy choice . bugs bunny special , aka carrot cake . what 's up , doc ? ! and wow was that a big slab of decadent goodness ! fine cream cheese with a nice dollop of whipped cream on the side . fantastic ! i finished my beer and asked tall drink for the bill . it was around 100 bucks and with tip even more . but i was told not to behave , remember ? anyway , i paid and rose to leave , but not without smiling at td a final time . i 'm sure she awaits my return with patient desire . and i shall return one day . perhaps with an even greater desire to misbehave ....
0	i was on vacation and forgot my medication , so i came here on a random tuesday to get a prescription filled . there was only one pharmacist working , so a simple prescription took about an hour ( the medication is already pre-packaged ) . it was a bit frustrating to wait so long for something so simple . other than that , it 's an average walgreens but there are peddlers outside , and the clientele inside can be a bit odd . it 's nice that this location is open 24 hours .
1	where to begin ? ! el dorado and ariana made my wedding day super special for my husband and i. we were looking to do a small reception for 50 guests and it was absolute perfection . they worked with us via phone , email , txt , and always catered to our every need with a smile on their face . the space is just perfect , roomy yet cozy , contemporary , casual yet fancy . whatever you need , they can make it happen for you . they printed personalized menus for us , had a cocktail hour set up for us , and were open to changes up to 2 hrs prior to our event . the food- omgosh the food ! ! ! every single guest of ours , from grandparents to two year olds loved every bit of food , so tasty , so fresh , and the presentation is phenomenal . this is some of the best food i 've had even in comparison to some nice places in la . drinks- the drinks are just as fresh as the food and are all so tasty . margaritas/mojitos made with real fresh lime and pi\u00f1a coladas with fresh blended pineapple . i just ca n't wait to go back . el dorado is a must go to restaurant in las vegas , hidden right behind the mall near the wynn and behind circus circus . so near the strip and far enough to avoid the large crowds trying catch a table . probably a 5 minute drive away and such a quiet relaxing place to enjoy great cuisine and drinks . my husband and i can not thank you guys enough for all that you did for us , and we will be sure to make a visit at least once every trip we make out to vegas .
1	i have been coming here for a few years now and it is a great place to grab some quality mexican food , and for the price , you ca n't beat it ! i recommend the rolled tacos w/ guacamole or any of the breakfast burritos .
0	the service was good but i ca n't say the same about the food . my food was super greasy and it just did not taste good . the prices are kind of high too .
0	dans la commerce au d\u00e9tail , parait-il , le principal facteur est la localisation . cet \u00celot plac\u00e9 judicieusement pr\u00e8s de la piste cyclable et entre le canal lachine et le march\u00e9 atwater \u00e0 certainement un avantage durant les jours ensoleill\u00e9 de la belle saison ! c'est d'ailleurs la principale raison de d\u00e9gust\u00e9 une glace ici puisque le produit lui-m\u00eame est correcte mais pas exceptionnel .
0	dear lord . we 've been sitting here 45 minutes and got 1 drink and still no food . it 's saturday . and it 's empty . we are only staying to see how long it takes at this point . completely horrible experience . i may not stay at the hotel again i 'm so upset .
0	hostess ' are lame when it comes to seating , so just tell them were you would like to sit before you get moving to your table . every server i have had here has been awesome , and they do n't card you if you come with a middle aged man with a black amex : d
0	after hearing so much about this place , we went to have breakfast there.it is way overrated ! ! ! ihop 's pancakes are way better .
0	we are in the midst of a very stressful transition , moving across the country from charleston , sc to portland , or , in order to access better educational and therapeutic resources for our daughter camille , who has cerebral palsy . one of us airways ' gate agents , connie owens , took it upon herself this morning to make our travel even more difficult , stressful , and inconvenient . i do not have sufficient words to express my absolute disgust and disappointment with ms owens ' lack of compassion , flexibility and courtesy . we have flown with our daughter many times in the past eight years , usually taking us airways because their crews have been unfailingly helpful , sympathetic and courteous . until now . camille is now twelve years old , nearly 100 pounds , and almost five feet tall . she is non-ambulatory , non-verbal , has autistic-like sensitivities , and often will require one or more diaper changes on a long flight . consequently , we always sit as close to the back of the plane as possible , as she is much too large to change in the tiny bathroom , and past flight crews have been very accommodating in arranging to either block off the aisle , screen off the last row of seats , or allow us to use the floor of the galley when everything is locked down after service . we were explaining this to the flight crew and ms owens when she took it upon herself to insist that that absolutely could not be done , that we were only allowed to change camille in the bathroom , which is physically impossible , and to aggressively verbally berate my wife christina over wanting to make some arrangement so that we could get to our destination with a minimum of discomfort and inconvenience to ourselves and our fellow passengers . her aggression set off our daughter into a loud and prolonged screaming fit . rather than wait for the meltdown to pass , or to back off and give us a chance to calm our daughter , ms owens immediately contacted security to have us removed from the plane , which was unnecessary , humiliating , and a tremendous inconvenience . the security manager , mike , was extremely kind , courteous and helpful as he assisted us from the plane , and consequently rebooked our flights for tomorrow , and set us up at a hotel near the airport . nonetheless , this has made a difficult and stressful trip even more so , and has caused us to have to scramble to rearrange things at our point of arrival . we are also stuck in a hotel without most of our luggage and some of our prescriptions . this has been , overall , a horrible experience , and certainly will make us think twice before flying us airways or its affiliates again . in addition , i can not imagine that ms owens ' actions were in any way acceptible per the ada . i attempted to call to make and resolve this complaint , but the agent and supervisor i spoke with insisted that it could only be addressed through a web form , promising contact in one to three business days , which is infuriating . on the positive side , yvonne j , another gate agent , was tremendously helpful and compassionate . we also received assistance from an airport maintenance man , whose name i did not catch , in replacing a bolt on the wheelchair that broke as we were bringing it up the gangway . special needs flyers and parents - have you had similar experiences ? advice ? insights ? how do i get people to treat my child like a human being ?
0	great outdoor patio ... the praise ends there . terrible service ruined my evening with a group of friends . seriously , slowest service ever and they did n't seem to give s * * t. it was n't busy and it seemed as though the staff were working against one another . weird concept . i 've been there more than once and this is my first bad experience , however , my friends have warned me that the service is brutal . sorry i 'm not sorry .
0	small pastry counter by the elevators just of the casino floor of the mgm . staff have cute uniforms with aprons and hats . signage advertises their coffee , pastry case contains typical french-influenced breakfast baked goods and a separate case of cupcakes . all have good presentation . opted for a coffee and a treat . coffee was very basic , brewed and waiting hot . not something i 'm willing to shell out the same price as starbucks for- and there 's literally one in the lobby . despite signage about their cronut , they did n't have any in stock either of the two days i popped by . cupcake was dry and had a distinct taste of refrigerator instead of freshness .
0	this is a good gap outlet at times . normally , we come out of this store empty-handed because the prices were too high . the last couple of times , though , we have found some good bargains in there clearance section . the store is clean and organized . the employees are okay .
0	i 'm changing my review to a one star ! my boyfriend found out about this shop when the owner came in to buy a battery for his truck and invited him to check it out . these past few months we 've owned our vapes we were pleased with the service at first .. big smiles and personable staff . today we stopped into a different vape shop that 's right around the corner from our home . reason being my boyfriend 's vape has been acting weird and hits weak . well the guy behind the counter was ever so polite to check it out . he then pointed out this vape is a complete knock off after showing us their display and what looked to be a nicer version of what my boyfriend has . we 've pretty much chucked it up as a loss since i know they do n't want to hear it from us . i get it , it 's retail business but selling people junk should be a crime . i 've come into this location and mentioned that my vape has a burnt taste to it . i was then told i was vaping `` too long '' and that 's why i get that nasty taste . so i started counting how long i use it , each rip . i also clean it vigorously with a q tip and make sure the tank is n't leaking again , which it does frequently . i 've been replacing my tanks over & over until i finally stopped using it for a month or so out of frustration . that and the fact i know from reading previous reviews they do n't want to own up to anything or help anyone . fine ! i rather take the $ 75 loss and take my money else where . i should of known the day this guy barged into the shop yelling about how they sold him a $ 300 dollar piece that was junk . this guy was livid , ranting about how he owns his own vape shop where he 's from and he paid a taxi driver $ 60 bucks to get there from the vape convention that was going on . i thought the guy was crazy . after finding out my bf 's piece is an $ 80 clone ? i 'm in disbelief they could do that knowing we were looking forward to coming back and spending good money . super pricey , wo n't recommend it to anyone i know ever again .
0	last saturday we had lunch here and it was just ok ! now i can say i have been there ! ! ! ! ! the only reason i give it two stars is because our waitress was great ! you have to order exactly what is on the menu ... we asked for onion rings instead of fries and they said `` no '' . you have to pay $ 14 for onion rings no substitutions ! i tasted my friends burger with blue cheese and i have never had something more disgusting than that ! ! ! i tasted the burger with the pastrami and the description on the menu was better than the burger ! i had the chili with corn bread ... marie callender 's is better for half the price . the food looks great but the taste is not worth the money nor the million calories that guy 's food packs ! there are thousands of places in las vegans that are much better than this place ! have a drink , enjoy the experience and eat somewhere else !
0	the worst collection of art suited for those who know very little about art . this gallery is neither progressive , provocative , or intellectually stimulating . it is perfect for charlotte .
1	best croissance that 's all u got ta say .....
1	on sunday morning we went and got montreal bagels and then walked to this park ... it 's a bit of a hike , but the weather was nice ... to see the tam-tams ! my sister had really hyped the tam-tams to me , so i went in a bit skeptical .... but she was right ! i ca n't really explain why this was so fantastic , especially because really it 's a bit ridiculous . this is a big park and i do n't know it well enough to direct people to where exactly you need to go , but by the large monument ( the one featured on the picture for this attraction ) , you will find a group of drummers that set up here every sunday . depending on the day , there may be more , or less . apparently the group can get pretty huge , but either way , they all gather around in a sort of circle ... and drum ! the environment is very `` come-as-you-are '' ( read : hippy ) , but it 's such a laid back and accepting atmosphere . the drummers just sort of jam together , playing all sorts of different types of drums and bongos . people go and dance in the middle ... kids go and pound on the drums ... lots of people get high ! even not high , this is a pretty fun thing to watch . it 's mesmerizing somehow . again , i ca n't explain what made this so great . we just sat back in the beautiful weather , snacked on our bagels and watched the craziness unfold around us . it was so unique and so weird .... but so musical ... it was just cool to be a part of it !
0	5 stars for the fun that i had . 1 star for the racist promoters/security we had to deal with . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - yes racist . let 's see if you guys agree with me on this . it 's halloween . you can wear whatever you want no matter what race you are ! is this not racist when one of the promoters , made 2 of my friends buy surrender tshirts for $ 40 each ! you may ask why ? because they were too revealing .. wtf .. revealing ? ! ? they are guys .. they just had a swat vest on that was zipped up ! the only thing showing was their arms ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so they bought it to not get into a fight . then , we got into the club ... they got hot and took off their shirts ... security or the promoter supposedly were following/surveilling them around the club for some apparent reason and told them to put their shirts back on or they will get kicked out of the club ... wtf ? ! ? ! ? my friends were pointing out to them all those other white guys that were like half naked and had even more revealing costumes than they did ... it did n't matter to them ... so they put the tshirts back on once again .... ridiculous or what ? ! ? ! ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - otherwise , this place is a mini version of xs , but somehow i had way more fun here than xs this past weekend . we went on a friday night , and even though we are not allowed to put our feet in the pool , it was still spacious and beautiful . music was awesome on friday night . hot gogo dancers .. small dance floor but hey , you are here for the atmosphere of the whole place ! i am glad i have been able to come here during the day and during the night now ! they give you stamps so you are able to go in and out !
1	the only bad thing about this place is that they only accept cash . other than that this place is on my number 1 list for having the best burger i have ever eaten . to describe the burger i had was sooo juicy inside , the outside was chared crispy from the open flame , the bun was air fluffed soft and the cheese was very cheese . i would take a bite i can see the juices from the burger drip . everytime i think of this place my mouth begins to water : -p
0	i love breakfast food and was told this is the place to get it . i ordered the biscuits and gravy and it was terrible . it was more grease that gravy . i had to hold back throwing up . the potatoes that come with it were great but they did not hit the spot and i had to run to cvs to grab a snack to hold me over till dinner . skip this place , go to matt 's big breakfast .
1	went there a couple of nights ago . decided to dine in . they seemed pretty busy with take out and delivery and so the service was a little slow . the lady who worked there , owner ? , was very friendly and the food was very good . i thought it was better than average american-chinese places . portions were big and they used lots of fresh vegetables . lately , i have seen some small local restaurants , that have only one person taking care of everything : answering the phone , taking take out orders , and acting as a server ( bring out food , filling up drinks , etc. ) . i do n't understand why they insist in offering service for dine-in . i wish they would opt out of that and let customers order at the register . that would make things so much easier and faster . in addition , customers would n't have to wait forever just for the menus to come out or to get a refill . just an idea ...
0	my friend and i had lunch buffet there since two free buffet vouchers were included in the room package . however , i would n't eat here again even if we get another free buffet offer . there was very few choices and they all tasted so so . the ribs were dry and collard green tasted weird . there was a little fly on the sweet shrimp sushi enjoying its meal . how appeptizing ... normally , dessert section is my favorite , but the dessert selection was just okay . if you were to spend $ $ on a buffet , harrah 's has a much better deal and their buffet tastes much better !
1	me and the boyfriend were going on a date night to postino for their $ 20 bottle if wine a bruchetta deal . the wait was 40 minutes so we decided to go have a drink at lgo while we waited . we sat at the chefs table and were greeted by our server emma , i must say emma was the nicest server . we asked her a ton of questions about what her favorite dishes were for when we come back . she was so helpful . we ordered a bottle of wine , its a much better deal than a glass . they sell wine in their shop next door . you buy the bottle at retail price and there is no corking fee . we got a bottle for $ 13 ! ! you can not beat that . after chatting with emma for a while and seeing the food around us we ended up taking our name off the list at postino . ( we still love you postino the wait was just too long ) . emma recommended the padres pizza which is not on the menu . it was delicious . no sauce , four cheese blend , prosciutto , and fig ! the salty/ sweet combo is great ! ! we started with the shrimp ceviche and it was the best i have had ! ! the shrimp was plump and not sparse in the dish . lgo had a warm , cozy environment that is inviting . emma was fantastic ! the food was yuuummyy ! ! we cant wait to go back and try a different kind of pie !
0	the wife and i decided to give which wich a try since we were driving past and really like subs . we 'll keep driving next time . overview ( copied from their website ) : `` guests use red sharpies\u00ae to mark up pre-printed menus on sandwich bags . they select a sandwich from one of 10 categories , then choose the type of bread , size , cheese , spreads , and vegetables . the sandwiches are prepared to guests ' exact specifications and delivered in personalized sandwich bags . after they 've enjoyed their wiches , guests are encouraged to draw on their bags with the same red sharpies and hang their 'artwork ' on the community wall . '' at first , this seemed like a cool concept , but we were quickly frustrated by the fact that , having just spent time deciding what we wanted to eat and marking that info on the bags , we then had to stand at the counter while an employee inputted each of our orders -- item by item -- into the system . it would have been much faster for us to just place our order at the counter in the first place , rather than repeating the process twice . we waited nearly five minutes for our sandwiches , even though there was no line in the place . while i understand that time and care must be put into making sandwiches , i 've been spoiled by places like jimmy johns and potbelly where sandwiches are made quickly and taste great . which brings me to the taste of the sandwiches . meh . i 've experienced better . the bread was , at best , forgettable ( the wife hated it ) . the meat ( pastrami ) was overly salty , and the sauces lackluster . overall , to the question of `` which wich ? '' i reply , `` pretty much anyone else 's ! ''
1	if you like the one in ny , you will like this one . what i like about it is that the service is great , the ambience is awesome & the food is good . this is a place to go , not just because you want to eat , but because you want to indulge all of your senses . the hubby & i went here after a show to share a small meal & enjoy the place . everything was great . the only thing i can complain about is that the ny location has ( or had .. i do n't know anymore because i have n't been in a long time ) a bigger cocktail menu which included a mojito menu . i specifically remember a blackberry mojito which was amazing . unfortunately , they do n't have a mojito menu at this location .
0	do n't order the fried pickles : / if they were n't free with the yelp check-in offer then i would 've complained . everything else was just so-so , but i guess not terribly bad for a hotel resort joint . the ice cream sundae was tasty at least : p
0	i have eaten at blanco 's about 6 times in the past year . generally the food is good , and there are some dishes that are better than others . the chopped salad is very good , the green chili pork enchiladas and very good , the chips , when warm are better than most , and i have had several tacos ' that are great . i like the atmosphere , and the d\u00e9cor of the building . it is a shame that j. alexander 's closed next door , as that take some energy and ambiance from blanco 's . my chief complaint is the seating/reservations system ( or lack there-of ) . generally , there are about 4 young ladies who stand around the hostess stand , taking names , seating people , etc . it seems that there are about 2 too many . there seems to be no-one in charge and looks very hap hazard . two visits ago , we called ahead to check the wait , and they told us they could take our name , and as we were 10 minutes away , it would only be about another 10 minute wait once we got there . when we got there , it seemed our name was added then , and we waited 30 minutes . we were made to feel that they were not honest with us . we had dinner here over the weekend , and had another issue with getting seated . we arrived and there was only one couple seated in the wait area . we put our name in , and said first available . we were told 10 minutes . there were several open tables , both in and out . we had requested not to sit at a tall table , as we had someone who could not do that . there were 4 of us . as we are sitting there , and it is now going on 20 minutes , we see a couple being seated at an outside table for four . then another couple who was seated at a high table . both couple came in after we did . when i questioned the hostess about this , she told me that the couple seated outside had requested outside seating . when i asked her why `` first available '' did not beat an outside request , she said she was sorry , but had seated them first . she then found us a table to sit at . i am not sure how long we would have waited , and how many people would have been seated had i not spoken with her . it was just a poor start to a meal , and we had brought guests to experience the restaurant . i have eaten at many other fox concept restaurants and find them excellent experience . blanco is just not where it used to be , and with all the other choices for restaurants in scottsdale , not the best choice anymore .
1	i have been a member of this gym for a few months now and love the location . it is right near my office so i just go over to workout during my lunch break . the locker rooms are very nice . there is plenty of equipment and all the equipment is new , nice , top of the line . the place is just very , for lack of a better word , nice inside ! there are views of uptown all throughout the gym . i have also taken a few group exercise classes here and the instructors have been excellent . they have a functional training room upstairs which i use alot . it has ropes , trx suspension , kettle balls , trampolines , etc . cool room ! my only gripe with this place is that , in my opinion , it is n't that female friendly . little things like : -all the cardio equipment has tv capabilities but there is only like 5 channels available and half are sports channels -they play like super action , blow somebody up movies in the cardio theater ..... however , the majority of time there are just females in there ! -the only free weights are in the corner ( it 's kinda a tight corner ) upstairs . however , upstairs it is 99.9 % dominated by males . i lift multiple times a week and am usually the only female up there . many times i have felt like i was being stared at . these things above are n't that huge and the benefits of this facility majorly outweight these small complaints .
0	service at this denny 's was dismal . after waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10am , the manager did n't even apologize for the food coming late . food was mediocre . location was pretty sketchy . only go to this location if your desperate .
1	hands down best gyro in pittsburgh in my opinion . possibly the best gyro ever . even at 2am when there 's a line of drunk people waiting , the staff is quick and efficient . clearly they 've been doing this for awhile . the fries are not the best , but for some reason i always get them with the gyro because they taste so good together . the gyro is so jam packed with goodness that when they hand it to you you do n't think it 's that big ... until you unwrap the foil and start eating it . i always eat mine so fast that i nearly choke . i can think of no sweeter death . i used to frequent mike & tony 's on a regular basis when i lived in the south side . now that i do n't , i try to stop by whenever i happen to be in the neighborhood . i just ca n't resist .
0	i am at awe to believe that this hotel is rated 4 diamonds ( as claimed plastered onto the walls of the lobby ) where do i start ? first , the walls are paper thin . on one side of the wall i hear a couple arguing . on the other side i hear chinese people arguing at 4 a.m. the showers are so loud , i mean do i have to know when everyone around me is taking a shower ? second , the carpet and bed sheets are filthy . there were pink stains on the carpet and there were red stains on my bed sheets that i do n't even want to guess what it could be . the pillows are probably the most uncomfortable things i 've ever slept on . the shower was dripping when we arrived and it has to be adjusted a different angle every time we use it to get the dripping to stop . on top of everything , the hotel charges $ 22.40 a night for the `` resort and hotel '' amenities . are you kidding me ? this was nowhere close to a resort experience for us . i think the travelodge across the street would 've been better or just the same experience for a cheaper rate . never again .
0	i think this place owns the hot dog place , which makes sense . no one seemed to really like the pizza , and everyone was shooting here for a $ 2 hot dog . too bad the hot dog wieners are slim like slim jims . just okay , but great if you are short on time and funds !
0	verizon stores and their system of herding their customers must have been designed by some machiavellian-type person who watches from afar , with hidden cameras placed in all locations , and watches what transpires inside the stores like some sort of `` big brother '' experiment in human behavior . when i walk into a verizon wireless store because my unfortunately-named verizon glyde ( all i can think of is a personal lubricant , how about you ? maybe i have a dirty mind ... ) with a touch screen no longer wants to be touched ... the `` greeter '' scowls at me , tells me it 's gon na be at least an hour and a half , and then adds my name to the bottom of the queue . i instantly notice that it smells of excrement ... and that , quite literally , the store is crawling with humans . it 's like a bus station . there are sad-looking people on benches , huddled together for moral support , crying in the corner , and laying in a puddle on the floor . i relegated myself to sit by a wobbly-looking display with outdated products , hoping i 'd be left alone to wait out my sentence . i have rarely seen the likes of the despair that i saw in my two hours of waiting in the verizon store . i bore witness to two different women using verizon phones , calling customer service in tears , bawling about how the reps at the store refused to help them . i should have taken this as a sign . i watched a person pick off a really large scab . i saw a really together-looking dude get to the point of a breakdown when a rep jumped another customer in front of him in the queue . i mean , there was almost a brawl . i saw three crickets , a spider and a roach ... and this was all before my name was called . the service rep could not , no , would not , fix my phone . he took one look at the glyde and started to laugh . `` this is the worst phone verizon ever produced . i ca n't fix this thing . i wo n't even be trying . sorry , girl . you need to get yourself another phone . '' rep then proceeded to detail my options . a. buy brand-new expensive phone . b. buy pre-owned expensive phone . c. be phoneless . `` surely you must have a clunky zack morris-style phone to donate to a damsel in distress ! '' i protested . no dice . `` not even a loaner until my next paycheck ? '' not a snowball 's chance in hell . it 's ever so obvious that i was never going to get my phone fixed , and no matter what was wrong with it , i was going to be told that i had no choice but to purchase an entire new phone . i think it 's more than a little messed-up to not offer your customers solutions and options instead of backing them into corners . i 'm between paychecks , and could n't justify paying the evil overlords of verizon hundreds of dollars for another pos , so i am now incommunicado , and am totally bummed .
0	food is good service sucks . super slow ! not good for people who work here and have times breaks . i wish they would pick up speed . 15 mins for french fries is out of control . get it together ! ! ! ! so i can enjoy your food .
1	finally found good chinese in las vegas . prices are excellent , too . go out of their way to please ... i wanted a particular item ... they made it special for me . of course , language skills are always a problem with most ethnic restaurants ... but for everything that matters , it is great food at a great price .
1	the food is delish ! their pizzas were far superior to any others i 've had here in vegas . their chicken wings and garlic knots could both become my new addictions ! also , the service and customer interaction was perfection , which seems to be a detail that is all too overlooked in life ! biaggio himself is such a wonderful host that he makes you feel like family rather than a customer . also , they deliver all over town , yes all over ! i sure hope they open another location near my southwest home so i not only get the yummy food , but the awesome biaggio experience !
0	i really dislike it when i go to a resturant and do not get acknowledged . 10 min . is just too long . then to serve tepid beer and not offer a glass . not good ... not good .
0	im a hotel bouge . i work for the industry and tend to be very critical with hotels when i stay at them . first and foremost i will comment on the actual hotel itself . beautiful . charming and the rooms are very cozy . my boyfriend and i stayed here for my 30th birthday and christmas 2012 and we loved that it had a small kitchen complete with everything you need to make your own food . a luxury we used twice . however , there is a lack of service here that needs to be pointed out . after our first night. , housekeeping came in the middle of us having breakfast . i told them to come back in about an hour and we should be done . we got dressed and before we left the hotel , i called to request the room be serviced . when we came back , it was not serviced at all . all our dirty dishes and such were still hangin around . no towels refreshed . the next morning , we had to clean our own dishes before leaving . they have huge heavy doors at the main entrance and no doorman helping open doors for women , elderly , or anything . people are forced to haul open these huge doors while carrying their luggage and such . amenities and hotel comfort gets a 3 star review , but service lacks and loses two stars for it .
0	my hotel room was being flipped by a man when i returned to my room . i actually caught the man in my room going through all my belonging . it turns out it was the maid that let him in the room . then the flamingo ( every manager i have spoken to and there have been several ) argues that they are not to blame and will compensate me for my room charges . i even had to insist for a room upgrade after they moved me to another room after the incident ( as they call it ) . they were not sympathetic at all that my belongings were all gone through and that it was their maid that let him into my room . now if something would have been stolen then they say it would have been a different story . thank god i caught him in the act . i warn everyone , never stay at this hotel ! !
1	we loved ! dat phan was hilarious
1	this is one of the best coffee spots ever ! the people are incredible and the food rocks ! i am there at least once a week . it is an fabulous place to meet with your friends .
0	i 've only been here once and i like to give places a couple tries if i 'm left uncertain . from my experience the food was `` ok '' . nothing to rave about , nothing memorable . the ambiance is cool and hip . it was kind of dead for a las vegas restaurant but then again it was a monday night . i 'd give it a 2nd shot if i didnt have to pay for dinner .
0	on one hand , the sea life aquarium is an aquarium . if you 've seen one , you 've seen this one . on the other hand , it 's in a mall . that 's right . an aquarium in a mall . i mean concord mills is n't your typical mall , so what did you expect ? the attraction ( they say that a lot ) is run by a group that has a few of these - this is apparently the sixth in the us , and there are another couple of dozen scattered around europe . so you may have seen them elsewhere , but this is the first in the area . the closest in the us is halfway across the country , so there 's that . first , you buy your ticket . it 's not cheap ( though you can save a few bucks if you buy online , or if you buy an annual pass if you want to go a lot ) . expect to spend a good percentage of $ 100 if you have a family of four - and well more than that if you hit up the souvenir shop on the way out . on the way in , it 's not unlike a disney attraction - you get a little countdown timer , and cute animation and everything . only the images are n't centered properly , so the porthole of your sub is n't exactly where it should be . ignore that and pretend the room is moving , so you actually feel like you 're in a submarine , so that when the doors open , you feel like you 've moved , when in reality , you 've gone nowhere . a bit more money in this department would do wonders . even a visit to a disney property would help explain why it 's needed . regardless , you then enter a cave-like aquarium , and the fish are n't bad . they say there are thousands of them , and there could be : but there are n't a huge variety . if you 've been to the nc aquariums , you 've seen otters and beluga whales and all sorts of wildlife . not here . just a bunch of fish . even the touch tank only has a few starfish and some hermit crabs ( admittedly , they are big hermit crabs ) . but you can see a bunch of those at wings when you visit myrtle beach , it does n't cost you anything , you can get your favorite team painted on the shell and if it dies you can usually get a free replacement . there are a couple of nice displays - the horseshoe crabs are perhaps the most active i 've seen anywhere , and they do n't look dead ( like they often do ) . the rays swim , rather than burying themselves . the blacklight display of jellyfish is cool to look at , but you can see things like that in spencer gifts ( at least , i assume you can - perhaps i am dating myself ) . and the sea horses are always fun to watch . perhaps the best display is near the end , where you can walk through a tunnel and see the head of poseidon attached to some tentacles in some strange mythological mash-up . most of the sharks were hanging out here , including the only hammerhead i saw the whole time . one word of caution : the displays say not to use flash , which is fine because it usually reflects off the tanks . in fact , all of the plexiglass reflects horribly , so you get exit signs , display signs and the lady from waukegan in your pictures . try and take one looking up in the glass tunnel and you 'll get nothing but led lights and no detail on the fish because the lights are above you - in other words , pictures are almost a no-go here . but it is a reasonably interesting half-hour , especially if you have little ones . that 's right , i said half-hour . while it 's a big place for the mall , it 's not a big aquarium . you can stay about as long as you want , and you can cut through at the end to go back around again and again , but you probably wo n't stay very long overall . keep that in mind , and understand what you 're paying and you 'll be fine .
1	i do n't think too many people know that this place opens at 2:00 one day a year . that was today , thanksgiving , and it was the best thanksgiving dinner my new mate and i ever had in our lives . if you did n't have thanksgiving dinner here , i do n't believe you had the best . nice , comfortable booth in a nice , comfortable room with exceptional service from nice , well mannered people . woohoo ! is right ! ! !
0	i was pretty disappointed with our visit here , we were expected so much more . the food was actually pretty good . we got the appetizer sampler combo and there was plenty of food on it . the avocado eggrolls are the best ! i was not a fan of the california club flatbread appetizer pizza . i like the texture of the crust , but not a big fan of the toppings . i did not think the aioli that was drizzled on it went well with the pizza . but , you may like it because my girlfriend loved it . the big disappointment was actually the beer surprisingly . i actually enjoyed my hefeweizen very much . light , full-bodied and flavorful . the red i tried was n't very good however . my girlfriend 's stout was a huge disappointment . it was actually one of the worst stout we have ever had . not a lot of flavor and had a weird aftertaste . i actually had better experiences with the bjs in california more , i do n't know why . each chain is a little different i guess .
0	i do n't expect a fancy parade of amazing service , offerings of exotic produce or a team of personal shoppers fawning over me when i go to the grocery store . given that grocery shopping is already the bane of my life , i have really low expectations for the place where i purchase my impressive assortment of top ramen food products . seriously , i 'm not shopping for organic baby prawn medleys and goose liver patte ' ... i just want to get in and purchase my run of the mill poor person foods like canned beans and frozen dinners . so when i say low expectations , i mean really low expectations . so it really says something about the smith 's that i would rather saw off my own foot than shop for my failure cuisine at their grocery store . when someone that has been beaten by the poverty police and kicked in the face by life as much as i have does n't want to shop at your store no matter how great your prices are , you have got some problems . i do n't actually notice that the prices are much different than any other store in the area , though . to be fair , i may not be noticing prices because of the instant seizure caused by walking into the herd of people always grazing around in the smith 's . the prices seem to be the same overinflated prices seen everywhere else in las vegas . same high prices , same fake discounts . the parking lot at the smith 's is absolutely insufferable . it 's like parking at walmart , but without the option to park really far away in hopes that your car wo n't be needlessly assaulted . you can always count on smith 's to give you that uneasy sensation you get when leaving your car in a suspicious lot . any sense of relief you feel when finding your car unscathed at the end of the shopping trip will quickly subside when you try to leave and a number of cars pass behind you , almost collide with you , get in your way and speed . despite the anger and road rage you will feel in the smith 's parking lot , i think you can really count yourself lucky that none of these citizens of our fair city ran you over as a pedestrian . when you get inside the store you might actually just have a panic attack and die . i always hope that is what will happen to me when i see that battlefield . to say that smith 's has an overcrowding problem is a laughable understatement . smith 's makes every day feel like black friday : you will bump into other people , wait in line to look at things and have trouble navigating the store through all that human garbage . i guess that is not too bad when you think about the hand-to-hand combat that could ensue should smith 's ever hold true to the black friday tradition and place an item on sale . ( they are keeping us safe . ) bring your hand sanitizer for all the awesome contact with humanity you 'll be having at the smith 's ! i think the owner must be friends with the fire marshall because there is no way that place is n't over capacity at any given time . if it were n't for all the food in there i 'd say it was like a third world country . except , i guess third world countries do have food but no one can afford it . so it is pretty similar to a third world country . without the charm . i guess it is not fair to hold the business responsible for the fact that so many people descend on the store like the apocalypse is upon us . however , i can and do blame them for not staffing the store properly and relying almost exclusively on self-checkout . this causes all those people to become trapped in the store and creates a feeling desperation and taints the air with the smell of sweat . it also fills my heart with hate . there is always a huge line of frustrated people clogging up the isle in the front of the store . there is only one isle with a person checking and it 's always crammed , so people start to self-checkout with way too many items or when they are way too stupid to operate the sophisticated check out equipment . i hope the person who thought of self-checkout was put to death for his crime against humanity . once you are able to get to the front of the line , expect to get held up at least once because even of you are not purchasing alcohol the bagging area is very weight sensitive . in fact , smith 's is so concerned that you are going to steal from them that they force you to wait for an attendant because you dropped a ten cent packet of koolaide . then you have to wait for an eternity because smith 's has left the same person in charge of 8-10 stations and there are clearly a ton of people who should not be using self checkout to begin with . look , i 'm not classy , i do n't have any pride , i 'm shopping at smith 's for crying out loud ! grocery shopping is a horrible chore and i hate it with a passion . unfortunately smith 's makes a chore feel like a war . i should n't have to take a nap afterwards .
0	ok so this is the first time we have been here so not sure if all the locations are the same . we started off with the egg rolls and they were the best egg rolls i 've ever had . then came our entre , we ordered the shaking beef & pork lo mein for my husband and i to share . my husband loved everything but i could n't eat any of the meat because it was extremely salty , both the beef and the pork in the noodles were very salty so i just ate the noodles . with that said i would n't take any one with high blood pressure to this place . i do n't have high blood pressure and i could n't eat this meat . if for some reason we decide to give this place a second chance i will have to order a vegetarian meal .
1	mouth watering dishes ! all of them ! yeah , i 'm the type to pick off everyone 's plates . do n't judge me ! and i 'm such a sucker for outdoor patios ! ! vegas weather does get a bit crazy , but you have a choice of sitting in the indoor patio ! what ? yes ! ! get the steak and the sandwiches . all of them . take it togo if you ca n't finish it cause it taste equally amazing hours later in traffic or on the plane !
1	delicious !
0	worst service i ever had ! our party waited over an hour and a half for food to arrive , we waited 20-30 minutes for chips & salsa and even for them to bring us drinks ! ! when we complained about the long wait the manager and owner did not want to hear it ! it was obvious they do n't want to improve their restaurant by listening to customer suggestions . they were rude and flat out did not care to insult us paying customers for letting them know their food took too long ! ! we will never go back , good mexican food can easily be found anywhere and this place was pricey and the food was mediocre , so you wo n't be missing anything by skipping this place and going somewhere else were customers are valued !
1	i read a good review of this restaurant in the new times and as i love to try something interesting , i had to try it . to my surprise i knew the owner , esther , from when i worked at phoenix college and she was a student there . she 's always been a hard worker and i can see how much effort she has put into her restaurant venture . the restaurant was very clean and neat , and esther was a very gracious hostess to all the customers . i had the pepper soup , which comes with a little dish of habanero pepper puree if you want to make it spicy . watch out ! only use a tiny bit because it 's really hot . then i had a caribbean meat pie . it was really good -- spicy and savory . then the yassa chicken . the chicken itself was deliciously flavored , and then topped with with olives , onions , and bell pepper sauteed in a mustard sauce , then served with rice . it was very good ! i want to come again and try some of the other dishes . i highly recommend this place ! esther is a sweet lady and she takes good care of her customers . i wish her the best of luck with her new restaurant .
0	i know this place intimately ........ good customer service from all the airlines , great fast check-in of luggage and the airlines are usually on time . food is mediocre though . baggage claim can be a bit of a wait though ... usually 20-30 minutes .
1	i have been to the foundation room numerous times over the years while visiting vegas and mandalay bay . it is quite a large area as there are many rooms you can sneak off too , provided you are on the vip list or possibly know the right people . the view of the strip is awesome and that is what most people come up here for . the cost of drinks are quite steep , but it is vegas and it is the foundation room , but just be prepared . it would be a great date night for you and the special someone , especially on the slower nights which are usually tuesday/wednesday .
1	excellent food and presentation . they 're going for that new orleans flair . i personally have not been yet , but i could only imagine from the ambiance that nola provides . i went on a wednesday and there was a live jazz band playing . had the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection . it came with cream spinach and potatoes . the spinach left a bit to be desired , but the meal itself was still delicious . for an appetizer , i had the bbq shrimp . 6 pieces of the juiciest most succulent shrimp ever . the place was a bit pricey , but i 'd say it 's worth it .
1	great lunch at julian serrano .. me and my fiancee 's last meal before leaving lv . every single thing we put into our gaping maws we loved ...... lobster gazpacho , goat cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers , fried potatos with chorizo and fried eggs , seafood-saffron rice , bread with tomato and machego cheese , tuna/raspberry skewers , lobster/pineapple skewers .... i definetily want to come back for dinner when they have a more extensive menu . the pitcher of sangria we got was $ $ $ $ at 44 bucks , but it was huuuuugge . service was very good and our server made good recommendations .
1	they are under construction so it 's a little confusing , especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper ( but as my husband commented , maybe the cookies are really good ) . anyway i wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice ! and it was n't that fake nice , they were actually happy upbeat people .
1	went there for lunch and the food was fantastic ! there is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking . their ice tea is a black/passionfruit blend that was very refreshing . very trendy decor and i would definitely go back !
0	the teppanyaki ( steak & shrimp ) was very good and our chef was a lot of fun but i really did not like the sushi . i actually thought it was my least favorite sushi in vegas . the service was good , the staff attentive and friendly but i would not go here for sushi ever again .
1	where would i be without my tj 's ? ? ? i go for everything ! wine , coffee , cheesecake , cookies , and food ! not to mention wonderful flowers !
0	we were planning to eat elsewhere before but since they were full , we decided to eat at mbgfr . we were seated right away and our server was very nice and attentive . we started off with the hummus ( i think jalapeno ) and then each got our own chicken souvlaki pita . everything was a-ok and i 'll probably return .
1	the all-you-can-eat buffet is the best value in town ! i just love the onion bhagis and potato pakoras . i believe there are always at least 2 chicken dishes and a tandoori chicken , the standout was the chicken keema aloo . i 'm not a big fan of okra , but what they did with it and onions was very nice and subtle . they also had a squash dish that had nice , firm pieces of yellow squash in a wonderful sauce . this was also the first time i tried their dessert ; it was gulab something : perfectly round balls of fried deliciousness in a hot , syrupy goodness . i could just have these for breakfast like pancakes ! i did n't even get a chance to try their condiment bar . trust me , you will leave very full .
0	this place is nothing but sucks ! i ordered the dry chicken , microwaveable- '' mexican '' rice bowl and it was disgusting . the veggies were mushy and over `` saut\u00e9ed '' almost drowning in oil and the fake , industrial-tasting flour tortillas are so gross . to make things worst , i get two perrier waters and it came to $ 8 for both ! no thanks ! and when i tried to return them , ms. patty who rang me up , gave me so much attitude . i could care less about it , i am not paying $ 8 for carbonated water . she said `` i have to get the manager * rolls eyes , gives me the `` you little punk look '' * , and i said `` i have an hour layover , so i 'm not going anywhere '' horrible experience and i beg you , please just go elsewhere . i ended up getting free water from sbux , instead of throwing away $ 8 . hopefully las gets better food and soon . just go to the slot machines and make better use of your $ $ $ there .
0	just came to pass the time with a drink . nice location on the grand canal inside the venetian , great ambience . the margarita , advertised as `` the best in town '' , was definitely not , but for $ 5 at happy hour , was a good value . chips were standard out of a bag probably , but the salsa was good with some roasted pepper in there . update : despite not being a featured happy hour drink , i ordered the jalape\u00f1o-infused margarita . much better , the ingredients seem fresher ( the classic was too syrupy ) . the jalape\u00f1o-infused has fresh orange and cilantro in it for an interesting twist .
1	i 'm giving smashburger a 5-star rating primarily for the quality of service i received when eating there recently for my first time . the guy working the register was friendly , and when i was 77 cents short he covered it for me , thus saving me a trip back to the car and another hit on my debit card . the girl who brought us our food was also very hospitable , getting me several condiments for my fries , and even suggesting i try their chipotle sauce ( which i did , and it was decent ) . she also offered to get me a to-go cup for my drink when she noticed we were finished with our meals . it 's rare , especially these days , to feel like the employees actually enjoy their jobs and take pride in making sure that the customer has a good experience . as for the food , i got a 1/2lb bbq bacon cheeseburger , and it was pretty damn good . reminded me of a fuddrucker 's burger moreso than , say , in'n'out or five guys , definitely a little different than the norm when it comes to burger joints . i had the smash fries , which i thought were delicious with the seasoning they used . if you are looking for a burger but you 're sick of the norm , give smashburger a try , you might just be pleasantly surprised as i was .
0	if i could actually rate gllounge negative 3 stars .. i would . the manager & lash technician should take a course in customer service . i booked a appointment & arrived to be told i had no appointment ... instead of acknowledging their mistake , we ended up going back & forth regarding the `` imaginary '' appointment at 10am . also there is a huge language gap as the manager speaks below average english . i will not be back nor would i recommend this lounge to anyone wanting to be treated like a valued customer .
0	some staff were helpful . some seemed uninterested , the shuttle bus drivers were very nice . the room was clean and the hall decor seemed updated and fine with me . the shuttle service to downtown madison was a big plus since this hotel is not walkable to much . the rental bikes out front are fabulous when the kiosk is working . the beds were very comfortable but when the temperature in the room went up a bit and got warmer we could smell urine . we were on the pet floor ( without a pet ) and so we assume that was what it was . we could never find a luggage cart .... there was a wedding saturday night , we went and complained about the noise from the partying guests at midnight and it quieted down . we went and spoke to the guests ourselves at 1:30 again when they `` forgot . '' we had a fire alarm go off from the drunken wedding guest at 2:45 a.m. there were elderly folks and parents with babies all over the front drive and the manager or staff never came outside and told us a thing . i finally went in to ask and he admitted it was the wedding folks and it was a false alarm . i know it 's not their fault , but they could have handled that better . a `` sorry '' at some point about the noise or alarm would have been nice . even nicer would have been if the manager had offered us a deal if we came to stay again or free breakfast since we literally got zero sleep saturday night . the wi-fi on the 4th floor was pretty darn mediocre even though the manager said it was fine . i could n't download my e-mail to my phone ! here 's the thing , i can get a hampton inn for about the same price . i get free breakfast , a clean room and no rowdy wedding folks there so i 'm not sure that this was `` nicer . ''
0	ok , this place was really weird . i wanted to like it , but it 's very expensive and kind of confusing . we got there about 10 minutes before the last call for breakfast orders . our waitress confirmed we 'd still be able to order breakfast . she handed us like four menus , explained nearly every item on each one , and almost all of them had a catch ( something missing , etc ) . then we got a second waitress who took at least 15 minutes to get to us . we were not allowed to order breakfast . the food was n't bad by any means , but it was n't anything special .
0	i was not going to write a review because i felt i would n't be able to add to what was already written but then i saw the ticket prices ! ! $ 49.99 ! ! ! wow , i did n't pay for my tickets so i was able to watch the show with very little expectations . song selection was good , all the cast sing well but the script is weak and is just filler to get you to the next song . if i paid full price i would 've been quite upset . granted at that price range you ca n't expect grade a quality but there are so many better options in or around that price range . i think a fair price is around $ 30 a ticket
0	drinks special can be a good deal if you like to drink fast . the club is in an ok location and is a pretty small venue . the comics they get are ok but you get what you pay for . not a bad night out if you have already seen all the cool shows in vegas . the seating is banquet style chairs and if in the back you will have a hard time seeing . doing vip is a must ...
0	this used to be my favorite clothing store anywhere which i visited on every single trip to vegas about twice a year . they used to carry royal underground , true religion and locman watches . however , on my most recent visit today , i found that all these brands were no longer carried and there were much less shelves and displays than before . what happened ? ? ? i know that they had moved royal underground line to another store at the encore , but to my surprise that store was totally gone ! anyway , i would have given this store 5 star rating a year or so ago , but their selection has gone down the drain . please bring the good stuff back .
0	not the usual hilton standards . the building is new but the decor is old style , really . the hallway is of dark reddish brown walls and our room had a black toilet . there was no hot or warm water the morning we were to check out , date 4/4/13 . the staff kept saying that we had to keep our water running to get the hot water up to our floor , done that , not working . anyways , there are lots of better places to stay than this hilton failure . the only good point is that we were connected to the mall .
1	had a catered dinner here with 40 colleagues . food was very good , service very good . great location - even enjoyed a live string quartet playing in the `` courtyard '' outside the restaurant 's entry . definitely would go again .
1	this place is tons of fun ! i stopped in with my family to have oysters and beer and we ended up eating and drinking for a couple of hours . great ambiance , friendly service and good food .
0	sadly , another case of bad service happened again ! and all i really wanted to do was enjoy my furry watching ! furry what , you say ? the annual anthrocon aka furry convention that happens every june at the david l lawrence convention center . people dress up , in costume .... as animals . enough said . so to take in the primal action i had my sights set on a front row furry watching table near the window . we sat down and our server came around to ask for our drink order . we were n't sure what we wanted , so we said we needed a sec . after about 15 minutes we 're looking around for him and he 's nowhere to be found . finally , he reappears and says he has a family emergency and someone else would be taking over . fair enough . so we order our meals from the new chick . i got the coconut chicken salad which actually turned out to be decent ! nice and crisp coconut exterior and moist chicken inside . there was a good amount of chicken but i think i would have preferred a little more lettuce and veggies . i just felt as if the salad needed a touch more . but the most important part , the chicken , was great ! so we get ready to pay , there 's 8 of us , and we 're not allowed to get split checks because they want to include gratuity . i 've worked as a waitress before , so i 'm understanding on whatever they need to do . obviously it does get a little confusing on both ends when you have 8 people paying at once with different cards and cash . we set aside a $ 20 from someones payment inside the payment sleeve . she came back , exchanged payment from someone else , fiddled with the payment sleeve and left . somehow , that $ 20 in the payment sleeve disappeared . we thought she must have accidentally put the $ 20 with her other tips , that 's the only place it would have went because it was n't on the floor . we checked multiple times . only way it would have disappeared was when she was collecting money . again , i know how it is collecting a billion different forms of payment , so these things easily happened . in the end she told us she would just put in one of the orders as a `` walk out , '' which was nice of her . but when we asked if she could add up all her checks for the day to see if she had the extra money , she would n't do it . it obviously worked out for us because we did n't have to pay extra and perhaps for her too because she 's potentially got $ 20 extra bucks now ! plus , we had some prime furry watching action , so i ca n't complain too much ! !
1	i did n't stay here so i ca n't talk about the rooms . i was there for an event . the meeting rooms were clean with a good air conditioning system ( it works and you did n't need an engineering degree to adjust it ) the lobby was spacious and clean as well . looks like they have coffee for the guests as well . live it up you are in las vegas for cryin ' out loud !
0	ughhh ! i am going to restrict my american apparel shopping to the internet . when i spotted this shop , i thought it was a fake ! i never imagined the stores would look like a cross between a broken-down bodega , a plato 's closet , and a salvation army . i was actually waiting for the smell of mothballs and `` the indignant '' to overwhelm my senses . i picked-up the usual goodies ( like knee-high sporty-socks and ironic scrunchies ) , but as i was swiping my card , i had the feeling of being insanely ripped off . this was a $ 60.00 bill for something i could probably get for $ 10.00 at a flea-market ( there is always some crazy tube-sock dude at those places ) . sometimes , the environment can really affected one 's perception of the product . ( i think we have all bought an obscenely priced pair of sunglasses because a really `` nice '' sales associate knew just how to sweet-talk us ... umm , that will never happen here . so , no worries about that . i hardly heard the `` cashier 's '' voice ... she literally just said the total . end of conversation . where is the manager here ? ) . the place was less-than-clean ( seriously , it 's called a swiffer , put down the iphone and use it ) , poorly organized , less-than-inspiring ( bare walls and metal hooks ) and staffed by people who clearly do n't want to work there . ( put down the phone , try a greeting , attempt a smile , ask your customers if they need help , clean a little , thank a customer when he/she makes a purchase , and grow the & $ % # up ! ) what a waste of space ( we were the only people in there ... maybe because there are really nice stores on the strip with super friendly employees ) . seeing this made me lose complete respect for this brand . ( and , employees , the place is n't hipster chic ... it 's dirty and ugly . i know it may be difficult for you to tell the difference , so just ask yourself , if your stupid iphone fell on the floor , would you put it back up to your face , or would you drop it in a vat of purell ? yep , there you go ! get cleaning ! and , try it with a smile . )
0	brunch : went there for brunch once and it was eeally ok. we could n't even get a clean glass of water . imagine ! and the food was good but nothing `` woah '' about it . in my opinion , this place is a bit overrated and overpriced for the menu they have to offer . i will give it a try for dinner . let 's hope this time it will be less disappointing .
1	the only real reason why i visit vegas in the 1st place . drink of choice is of course the 190 octane , highly recommended . it 's like drinking jamba juice and boosts replaced with tubes of everclear . believe me guys adding that extra shot will do it just right ! i know it did for me : p so who 's down for a random vegas trip , i know i am !
0	eeww is all i could think of as i walked the halls of this school for a tour . most of the classrooms did not have windows . all rooms were dark and dingy . the floors were dirty and the carpet old . the entire school was very quite and did not hear the normal chatter from little children . not even from pre-schoolers . the playground for pre-schooers is a joke . completely walled up . the school might perform academically but i think at a high cost of the childs other development including social skills and physical development , being verbally expressive etc .
0	leaving work and noticed that my tire was flat with an arrowhead shaped piece of metal between the tread . pulled it out and used the fix-a-flat since i do n't have a spare . pressure held after i aired it up and drove home . next day removed the tire and took it to mcfall 's , i showed them where i removed the shard and you could see where the goop had come out when i inflated the tire . they said nothing was wrong with the tire and there was no puncture , maybe somebody let out the air ! took the tire to discount tire where they found the leak ( right where i told them it would be ) and patched it .
1	ah , a bit of deutschland here in usa . beer is good ( duh ) , food it depends on what you order . i was born in germany and raised off schnitzels and wursts so i may be overcritical on some of their items , but the weiss wurst and sauerbraten are pretty good . what makes this place a great hang out for me is the biergarten .... 1. awesome view 2. lots of seats 3. bathrooms close ( lots of beer = lots of trips ) 3. i can smoke cigars 4. great scenery . inside is load with music and people dancing . always amusing to watch and take in the atmosphere . i plan on spending time here for the world cup for sure .
1	love this place it 's the perfect neighborhood bar . great craft brews , my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch . food is great as well , i usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great . i have had entrees a couple times and they are also good . service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink ! !
1	classy and beautiful with pretty girls , pools , and poles i 'd recommend bottle service here for convenience
0	rudist assholes i have ever seen . even for old town ! and that says a lot . my buddy and and i went in to have a couple of beers and bet on the horse race . we each had about 5 large in our pockets to bet . the place was empty and they basically asked us to leave because we did n't have a reservation . really ! at 10:30 in the morning ! do n't , patronize this place . there are too many other places in the area that understand what customer service is all about . there was one young ladies review that petty much summed it up . shithole !
0	love the food . not a big fan of the environment . the chef/owner/namesake antonio park is charismatic but he lacks a staff around him to really make the restaurant work . excited to see what it can become but not terribly impressed with the dining experience thus far .
1	mamma better slap me , because i just sinned ... let me explain , i just got spoiled , i was rewarded with delicious food , and i did n't do anything to deserve it . you heard me , landed in charlotte and after checking into my hotel , i decided to b-line it to mert 's ; because there was a need in me to have some good food , and i got delicious food . first let me comment on the service ... it was genuinely amazing . i was promptly seated , and the hospitality was refreshing . the server helped me patiently figure out what was good , and we settled on southern fried chicken , collard greens and mac & cheese . the cornbread came out first , and it was mildly sweet , and tasty . let 's break down the meal . fried chicken : from the moment i took my first bite of the chicken breast , it was perfect cooked , juicy and hot , the meat was lightly battered , and the batter that was on it , was seasoned well . it was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken i have had , not dry at all . i would eat this every day , if i lived here , and i did n't have to worry about eating fried foods . recommendation , eat it , yum . collard greens : i 've had collard greens before , and this was good as most . admittedly , never had it with tomato before , but it was still delicious . i liked the flavor , and the greens were tender , soft but with a nice bite . the portion of the side was right , and complemented the chicken right . mac and cheese : yes sir , this stuff was creamy , delicious , sauce done with tons of cheese flavor . it was cooked right , because you do n't see any sauce/oil separation . in fact , all you do is taste the various textures , from the small clumps of cheese , to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente , but not much after . it 's like creamy goodness , yummy heaven , sometimes , i think you can make mac and cheese just the entire meal . here we go , i love good food ... but like a good infomercial ... there 's more ! what in the world is a sweet potato cake ? that 's lovely stuff , i had some , and it 's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing . i think they spiked it , crazy amazing , not overly sweet , the texture was nice , and it melts in the mouth . here 's the kicker ; i ate all the food and this does n't really happen much , but it was perfect portion . i 'm 6 ' 1 , about 225lbs , and i thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy ; but nope , it was just the right amount , and all for 15 dollars , with a coke . like many other yelpers , kick ass food . location is n't easy to find at first , but you want food , and you are in downtown , make this a perfect spot , for you and all your friends .
0	poor customer service . when i asked if they were able to check stock at another near location for a product they were out of , the lady threw up her hands and asked me if i knew where the next closest location was and simply told me `` i do n't know '' . she then told me if i waited she might be able to look it up . so i waited and finally just left when i realized she had no intention of returning to help me as she decided to help another customer . it seemed to me that having 3 customers in the store was too much to handle for 2 employees .... being that i just relocated from out of state , i 've quickly learned this is not a place ill be returning to , regardless of its proximity to my house . i drove to the mesa location and received 5 star customer service .
0	sorry yummy yummy , i 'm hoping what i ate stays in my tummy . we had food delivered ( which was free of charge -- nice ! ) and it arrived close to when promised . it was almost cold , which seemed a little odd for a quick delivery from 3 miles away . other than being cold the food looked really good , but the little lady immediately noticed the cashews she had paid an extra $ 2 for were not included in her meal . boo . then i had my first bite of general tso 's chicken ... and it tasted like battered packing peanuts ! holy great wall it was bad , worst generals chicken i ever had . no flavor whatsoever . i was starving so i doused it in hot sauce and soy sauce ( do n't even try the duck sauce -- not sure of it 's composition but not good ) and scarfed some down and tossed the rest . and now i sit here waiting , wishing , and hoping my iron stomach comes through and i avoid any double dragon action over the next 12 hours . wish me luck .
0	$ 18 for a bowl of soup with a 1/2 pound of spagetti noodles , two thin slices of beef , a pinch of basil , a pinch of bean sprouts and a pinch of cilantro with a couple hot peppers . maybe it was because it was the end of my four days in vegas and it gets tiring to be hammered with overpriced food day after day after day , but this was the final straw .
0	this is my neighborhood sprouts . the one time manager of this store used to live downstairs from me and i had no clue what he did for a living until long after he accepted a position with another company . after i found out what he did i mentioned i had only been in 2 sprouts and had liked the produce in the first one i went to ( 83rd and t-bird ) but when the new one opened at 51st and peoria , on my way home , i had been disappointed in the quality of the produce and had never gone back . he explained you do not want to buy meat and produce from a place that does not have lines at the register because they do not turn the inventory fast enough . he suggested i go a little out of my way and try his old store which does a much higher volume . if i am in the area i will also still stop by 83rd and t-bird as they do even more volume . some of their stuff is a little high priced but for price shopping i go to wal-mart or costco . so what do i like to buy there ? produce , pork brats , fish ( friday i got swordfish ) , several times a year they have buffalo , chocolate covered raisins ( i really have to watch myself ) . they have muir glen ketchup ( no corn syrup and great taste ) . i have tried some of their breads and chips and not been impressed . i do not go often but i am glad i took my neighbor 's advice and tried them again . and i have never had more than 3 people in front of me in line .
1	i have never stayed at a towmplace suites before and since the week i stayed in tempe was spring break it was a tad bit difficult to book a hotel room . this was the only hotel that had a room available even with my marriott status . it is a smaller version of the residence inn with a small kitchen . i am not complaining at all , the front desk person was the most helpful though giving me directions to the nearest whole foods market etc . and because of my platinum status with marriott she gave me free items in the marketplace , much appreciated . so . with that said , it is a good option if you are a business traveler and if you are traveling to a busy city with limited hotel rooms available .
0	my rule of thumb lately is not to review fast food locations unless they meet following criteria . service is outstanding or food is amazing . or my service was horrible etc . i am writing this review in hope management sees this , cause this will freak out alot of people . i ordered some stuff to go . i got burgers and a raspberry tea witch sounded good honestly . the burgers where average bacon was burnt like deep fryer bacon . that was n't the fries where cold . and the topper i started drinking the drink on the way home witch is like 5 mins even less depending on traffic stop lights sigh -- i will leave those for another story . the drink tasted good however i started noticing hard chunks of something i think maybe mix or something however you can tell there pods with a string attached normally needing to be blended longer so not to leave these is a cup . espic a white cup that shows up . i dont have food poisoning or any of those signs . however when you see this me being from phoenix i tend to freak out espic not knowing what i ingested , so i hope management can see this . i do not need any type of reimbursement just letting company know .
0	i think i 'm about the only person who lived in charlotte who is not a cantina fan . i 've been there several times but i 've always been disappointed . likes : it 's a fun atmosphere , buzzing with energy . the margaritas and guac are good if you 're willing to pay up for them . dislikes : so expensive , even when they 're running `` specials '' like about $ 18 for a pitcher of margaritas . i had pork tacos one time : the food is sub-par and the quality is not great . after that , i just got drinks there . it 's always packed , which can be good or bad depending on your preference . take it or leave it : leave it . it 's trendy but majorly over-hyped and over-priced . i would expect better quality from a `` fancy '' mexican place .
0	small limited very reasonably priced friendly employees unique speciality items but not intended for your complete shopping needs this location is steady busy with lots of parking
0	24/7 local video poker sports bar , everything you 'd expect . it seems like i 'm always just stopping in for a cheap breakfast , the pt 's platter is way better than its ihop and denny 's counterparts and the waitresses are much friendlier . unfortunately , i always get sucked into the video poker machines and end up leaving with a full tummy and an empty wallet .
1	best nail salon in vegas ! affordable and great quality ! i go to le and she 's so sweet and does an amazing job ! my gel manicure lasts for three weeks ! and i just go change it because i get bored with the color ! no chipping or peeling like other places ! best price in town !
0	scratch my last review . if i could give 0 stars i would , but 1 is the minimum . well , i guess i can give 1 star for the poor service guy that had to deal with my pent up frustrations from enduring the dis-functional service at airpark jeep . where to begin : they never entered in the $ 2300 service/maintenance/extended warranty plan that i bought with my jeep into my vehicle profile at the service shop . so i paid for 2.5 years worth of oil changes etc . for no reason ( even after i claimed i had one in the beginng ) ... then i found the agreement when i moved 5 months ago and i was not reimbursed the full amount because they pay a reduced price . for their failure to get off their lazy tush and see if i had a service plan , i ended up paying more for oil changes ... sure am glad i bought their stupid $ 2300 maintenance plan . epic failure # 2 : the manager failed to call me back ( called 3 times ) after i found the paperwork for the warranty and asked about my plan and how to get reimbursed properly . epic failure # 3 : i called the director of the whole dealership to complain about the manager that never called me back and their stupid warranty 'service ' plan , and he never called me back either . epic failure # 4 : my car has 43 , 200 miles on it and for the last 4 oil changes and 1 battery change everyone failed to mention anything about the 30,000 mile preventative maintenance ( which could have been done gradually over multiple visits ) , so today when i went in for an oil change and new brake pads , they informed my i had $ 941 of service that needed to be done because the 30000 mile stuff was n't taken care of ( they had 13000 to make me aware of the preventative maintenance ) .... last time i checked that is why you take your car in for regular maintenance so you distribute such costs over time and take care of your car so you do n't end up having a problem ! ! ! ! bottom line : do n't go to airpark jeep ever for anything ! the service department here is awful and i have no respect for the guy who sold me the crappy service plan either . and the management seems to be worthless considering they never call anyone back . i have bought 3 new cars and 2 used cars and have never had any problems like this from any other dealership . also , i hate writing reviews that trash a place ; sometimes people have a bad day ... my experience with airpark has been bad for 2.75 years . congratulations airpark jeep you earned yourself a hard to achieve 1 star review !
1	was in madison for a show at the frequency and decided to perform at the open mic here . the audience was lucky because i totally killed . i 'm just kidding , but i really did totally kill . i 'm joking about how awesome i think i am but the real joke was when i performed here , meaning that i told several awesome jokes that the crowd really enjoyed . a really awesomely attended show and the local performers were really funny . seriously though , i fucking killed it .
0	i 'm losing faith in this brand . i scheduled an appointment for new tires and when i arrived i was treated very rudely by kyle telling me i had to move my vehicle from in front of the building , yet when others parked in the same place , nothing was said to them . when my car was finally taken in , 30 minutes past my appointment time , it only took 15 minutes for them to install the tires and i was out the door . i contacted the corporate office about the appointment situation , it 'll be interesting to hear what they say .
0	we used to go to hash house for breakfast all of the time . we loved their french toast and gigantic waffle . however , in the last two months , we have stopped going as the last 3 times we went , the meat and eggs were entirely too greasy for some reason and the waffle was doughy ( not cooked enough ) and my french toast was burned . it takes an incredibly long time to get food re-done and honestly , i have to evaluate if the value is there as the breakfasts are pricey . i do n't need a ton of food , just good quality of food as they used to have . i gave them three stars as everyone should try them once , and my hope is they return to quality as then i will gladly return to the restaurant . until then , so many other places to have breakfast in vegas for far less $ . we also tried them for dinner to see if there was a difference with the kitchen perhaps but nope , over salted food and my now my bacon and french toast were both burned .... twenty minutes later , still chasing the server to check on our food ....... dropping another star on this review soon .......
1	my buddy and i came this place after attempting to go to another vietnamese restaurant , nam sao and found out it was closed due to fire . when we walked in the first thing i noticed was how clean it was . some places i have been look dingy and have an off smell . not this place . i ordered a rice vermicelli bowl with grilled pork , pork skin and egg rolls . we ordered spring rolls to share and my buddy got a bowl of pho . my friend was so impressed he told me to taste the broth . it was amazing ! layers of flavors and you could taste the herbs and spices . i decided then and there it would be the next thing i would order there . and while i was craving the bun , i was regretting not getting the pho . however , my dish was great . the pork was grilled perfectly . some places seem to have a real problem overcooking pork when it 's thin and grilled . the egg rolls were very flavorful as well . my friend has already recommended this place to some friends and i 'm dying to go back .
1	simply breath taking .. went here with hunny for dinner .. it was simply beautiful .. we had someone greet us at the doorstep , very courteous and friendly . i love the atmosphere there because it 's so relaxing , tranquil , and seems away from it all . dinner was beyond my expectations i had lobster bisque , not too creamy , i liked that . they often have some great vegetarian options as well .. i had the edamame/ scallion ravioli and martini which was delicious . hunny had the fillet minus the bacon .. oh ... this place has some of the best views of camelback and paradise valley . upon arrival , you can feel your shoulders start to drop and let the relaxation begin ...
0	the place has a cool atmosphere and people are generally nice but beware of the incredibly slippy tile floors - not even kidding . also , the area with the dj is far too small so do n't expect to stay on the dance floor unless you want to feel like a sardine
0	the sandwiches have taken a huge downhill turn . avoid , even though they are dirt cheap at $ 2.99 . this location uses stale bread , end slices of tomatoes , brown lettuce and the most minimal amount of turkey possible . pathetic excuse for a sandwich.if your desperate , it still is boars head , so strip the turkey and use your own bread and condiments .
0	chose this restaurant because gordon ramsey is so damn tough on his show looking for top quality tasty food , so of course i would expect a restaurant to bear his name to be awesome . what a disappointment , hubs ordered a steak , very pricey , but very flavorless . i ordered the tomato bisque , while it was tasty , it definitely was n't worth over $ 13 for a bowl of soup . waitress seemed uninterested in her job , only took our order , and gave us our bill . she was n't the one to bring our food , and never once checked on us during the meal to see how we were doing . as my first trip here to vegas , i am going to say that all of these restaurants really are not great , but what do they care ? 90 % of their business is tourist ! their money does n't come from repeat business .
1	the menu changes everyday , which makes it tough when you find something you like ! we had a liver and heart pate ( tasty , it reminded me of liverwurst ) for dinner i had the 1/2 chicken ( great ) , it came with a spaetzle and mushroom side ( great ! )
0	this place always makes me feel like i 've returned home to juneau , ak but in some kind of alternate universe . expect tacky up north decor that is pretty endearing . also , as a bonus : pinball ! last i checked they had two pinball machines in the back corner . service is hit or miss and never spectacular but it 's a great place to catch a football game , or ring in your favorite drinking holiday with a small/med group and a decent place to catch some folky music .
0	my husband and i and another couple from out of state , who had never been to las vegas went to dinner @ giada 's on the night of sept. 30. we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary . i had made reservations a good month and a half before this date . our time was 5pm . i am a big fan of giada 's on the food network , and i knew the food should be great ! i thought she would never put her name on a place that was n't going to be a wonderful place to celebrate an occasion . wrong ! ! ! ! we went to the bar while waiting for our table , 3 glasses of wine and a tip , $ 54 . we were seated , and i requested a window seat ahead of time , but they put us at a side table where the shutters were barely open . we were given a wine menu , a food menu , then a tasting menu . we were told we all had to order the tasting menu or no one could . confusing ! we were told to order several dishes and share them family style . our waiter asked if we wanted to speak to the sommelier , which my husband declined , because he knew of most of the bottles on the list , and which one we wanted to order . he brought the wine over , and our one friend declined to have a glass . the waiter said , `` maybe you would like a scotch instead ? '' our friend said , `` as a matter of fact , i would '' . the waiter said , `` i was joking '' . he brought the scotch . we then ordered our food , the waiter suggested the antipasti plate . we each placed our order , then the waiter said that would not be enough food for you all , so i am going to order you a lemon spaghetti also . aaaaaa , we did not ask for that ? ? ? in the mean time , the sommelier came over . again , we did not ask for him . the food all came out , but took along time . portions were small , but over all , the food was good . then things really turned . we sat for a least 15 minutes with our dirty , finished dishes in front of us . finally , we stacked the dishes in hopes of being noticed . someone finally came over and removed them . there was no mention of dessert to us . our waiter came back over and asked if we wanted to see the dessert wine menu . by that time , we were ready to move on out of there . enough ! between the bar bill and dinner bill and 2 tips we spent close to $ 500 , and to top it off there was never a mention on `` are you here for any special occasion ? '' we took the manager 's card . i emailed him a few days later . he responded saying he was out of town and would call me in 2 days . no call came . 5 days after that , i emailed him again . he responded with , a sorry , i am out of town . i will call you tomorrow . well , guess what ? ? no call ! ! maybe if they had a manager who was around more , the poor service would not happen . not worth your time and money going there .
0	i will not be coming back here again . horrible service ...... my table was being watched by the manager and it was awkward . i felt so freaked out i was scared to order anything . not vapor friendly either . do n't eat here .
0	the trop is now a hilton property - a doubletree to be exact . i 'm not particular about where i stay in vegas , so on a recent weekend trip there i decided to book here since it was on special for 20 % off . the rooms are large and the bathroom is spacious as well . i loved that you can open the windows and the fancy shutters on them . pros : a separate check in line for all hh members and a separate room for diamond and other vips , separate breakfast area for hh members ( smaller buffet plus omelets ) , cookie coupons ( those cookies are damn good ) , great location . cons : if you 're a hh member , the $ 20 resort fee is a bummer since you 'd get those benefits anyways . overall , if the price is right , this is a great place to stay on the strip .
0	okay , gave them a second try and i 'm afraid it was n't much better this time around . this time i ate it right away ( a short drive back to work , less than 10 minutes ) rather than refrigerating it like last time . still with the stale bread ... what gives ? can someone tell me if the bread is supposed to be a hard crust-style bread or if it 's supposed to be soft ? the end that was not cut was super hard -- crunchy like a cracker . what a huge turn-off . i got a vito this time , hoping to salvage my last experience . again , still not much in the way of flavor except for the onions . i would have figured the salami would have contributed flavor-wise ... not so much . pretty much i ended up with a stale onion sub . ugh . jimmy john , i 'm sorry but i 'm so not impressed .
0	if you are in need after hours , then it 's the only place to go . but avoid it if at all possible . the place looks seedy and dirty . the manicure and pedicures are mediocre at best . i 've been 3 times in an emergency and never felt really pleased , but i got it done . it 's expensive as you compare to the average salons . i paid $ 55.00 ( $ 65 with tip ) for a mani-pedi . my normal place charges $ 35 for both , but they are not open after 7pm . so , do n't expect much and use them in emergency only !
0	i tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews . i enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest did n't so much . i will note that they do not have air conditioning . i was melting ...
0	food might have been good , however they were out of rice , guacamole , and oh ya , carne asada .
0	this is my first time to this hampton inn location . the set up is typical of other hampton inns . but , the staff is friendly and helpful unlike some other locations i have been to . i arrived before 3 pm and the front desk was able to put me into a room right away without fuss . the room is clean . i went to the fitness center in the late afternoon and discover the fitness closet instead . it was mislabeled as a fitness center . it was a small space with three pieces of equipment and a few balls . this fitness closet can not accommodate more than 4 people at at time . so disappointed .
0	heed the warning ... read this before booking . no one bothers to mention this fact . it 's an unadvertized secret till you have checked in . there was no wifi service in the room ... absolutely no wifi service in the room . you had to hook up your kindle , nook , ipad , or any smartphone if you do n't have 3g service at the hotel hobby where you can explore your dark side among strangers . what hotels do n't have wifi service in the room ? only in vegas and timbuk 1 ( i 'm sure timbuk 2 has wifi ) . the room had bulky cathode ray tv but dining area had flat screen tvs . the pool was not heated and i longed for a dip from a distance . the free breakfast was decent with minimal hot items like coffee and self-made waffles . the staffs filled coffee and hot water dispensers near the lobby throughout the days and nights . so travelers , whatever ever happen in vegas , stay in hotel lobby .
1	good food , crowded , hurried service ( the bus boy would swoop in and grab stuff as he said `` you done '' )
1	i have never stayed at a hyatt place hotel before , but i will make it a regular chain from now on . on this same trip i stayed at the hyatt place in nashville and both hotels were what every hotel should be . great customer service , clean room , and a great overall experience !
0	before pino 's was renovated , it was a tiny , unpretentious , hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere , and amazing italian food . it was also a byob , which i love . this was our `` go-to '' restaurant . after pino 's was renovated , there was a complete transformation . while the interior is now very nice , it 's no longer a byob , and the staff is full of attitude , which seems to stem from the total arrogance of pino himself . on our most recent visit , we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 pm . we arrived at 7:25 , and were n't even acknowledged until 7:40 pm . pino was playing maitre d ' , and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly un-apologetic . there were no open tables , despite having reservations . when 8:00 pm rolled around , i was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in . no such luck , since it was prime dining time on saturday night . finally , around 8:30 pm , the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement , crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in . pino then literally threw our menu 's at us , and walked away . not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience . the food is still good here , but i refuse to give my money to someone who clearly does not appreciate your business . there are so many good restaurants in the area , with owners/chefs who are happy to have you . next time you think about going here , walk an extra block to the point brugge cafe .
0	seems from the reviews that more than my mother-in-law have been screwed over by this location and false reports of damage . i would steer clear or take pictures of every inch of the car , before and after renting .
1	a truly independent spirit ! as all of the other small mom and pop stores falter all around our hero/owner ralph .... he ( year after year ) stands triumphant amongst the rubble . why you ask ? well , in my opinion .... sticking to his guns , an original vision . walking into to alternate reality you realize it lives up to it 's name . meaning , the mainstream takes the backseat . sure they carry the regular superhero comics and action figures but ...... the whole front of this rad shop is dedicated to independent comics and books from smaller publishing houses . it 's very impressive . to anyone that 's a cynic when it comes to comics ..... you should go , and randomly pick something up , give it a try . it 'll be the first time you realize that comics are n't only about capes and tights . oh , and there 's usually really great music floating through the air .
1	this place is great ! my husband and i ordered the other night and were pleasantly surprised ! great food , great pricing and quick , friendly delivery . i will note that the gentleman on the phone was pleasant and spoke english very well - we have had some issues in the past with communication break-downs so this was totally a bonus .
0	only coming here with a `` groupon '' we ate for $ 43 which does n't include sales tax by the way but does include all you can drink beer , wine , and champagne . choosing the dinner option we arrived on march 11 around 8:30pm which was shockingly busy for a week day . we stood inline for nearly 45 minutes which we thought was a bit crazy . slightly after 9pm we were seated . the waitress was nice enough and offered us the wine by bringing practically the entire bottle and even offered to bring us different ones if we wished but failed to ask or offer that the crab legs can be heated as i ate 3 plates of the cold . no biggie but it took another guest to point it out to me . the crab and shrimp cocktail were very good . also i really liked the salad wedgie with bacon and blue cheese dressing . thought it was a bit silly to just put 1 fried chicken breast into a basket though . maybe add fries or something to it . my partner seemed to enjoy the mediterranean section . the cupcakes were nice and all and many types to choose from but were very very dry and a bit tasteless . i ended up just eating the frosting tops off just to taste the flavor of each one i tried . the cotton was odd but was actually more tasty than the cupcakes . sadly if i had to pay full price for this buffet i would be way more upset and its not worth it but for half off its not bad .
0	i would never reccommend this location to anyone . first i had to wait ten minutes to get to order my food . when i get up i start my order then he went silent said `` im sorry what was that again '' so i went over half the order and he never replied back i said hello and no reply about 4 mins later he wants me to announce my order again . one car was in front of me . place was not busy , i worked in the food service for 5 years thru college and never had something like this happen at my places . if it did i would have been fired . after i make the order and get to the window 15 mins after i decided to go here and not wendys next door , he tells the only car infront of me to pull forward . well he only pulled so far forward or he would be in oncoming traffic but yet it wasnt far enough for my 4 door car to get out and around . when i told the guy that took my order i didnt have time to wait 20 more mins and how long would my food take before i paid him he said should be ready in 5 mins . 20 mins later the guy in front of me gets out of his car walks in and takes 1 bag of food , at the same time i turned and this guy gave me my food . so for about 35 mins took me for a order of two combos and they call it fast food . the guy didnt even address the situation just said sorry for the delay . i wrote churchs chicken website and never heard back . i also called and they said the manager was not there he would call me back . never heard back . horrible store dont go ! ! with that service they will have to shut down unless they revamp the staff . worst experience in my life ! ! !
0	i 'm glad we only stayed for the one night . the female at the desk needed a personality , the two guys were fine . the lobby almost looked done . the pool and the bar looked nice . the outside of the hotel looked as if it was under construction ? but was n't and needs to be . the room was trying sooooooo hard to be on trend , but it had paint over paint trying to cover the old style left from 3 decades ago . old tiles and old tubs/showers with new sink/vanity just looks like this company ran out of money . the floor had hair on it and needed a mopping bad . the bed was not quality either way to soft . over all so not worth the $ $
0	sorry this place really sucked . it was expensive and not worth the money you can cook better even if you ca n't cook .. i have no idea why people like and recommend this place . anything cheese is from what i had is in a fake cheese sauce . very orange even more so than velveeta . the side vegetable ( was asparagus ) was cooked till it fell apart and with less skill than the local 2 star asian buffet . disappointed more so than most places as only a very slight update 1/22/14 since my review i have n't been back so i ca n't update my review but my husband ate here twice . he said the steaks he had were ok. he did n't have vegetables either visit but did have the green chile macaroni and cheese and said it was very improved from what we had when we were there . i asked him how he 'd rate his meals and he said around three stars because it was ok. most likely i wo n't return anyway .
1	the skinny : nice hotel , great place to stay even though there is n't much to do other than go to the spa , stay by the pool , eat or gamble - but there 's nothing wrong with that ( 4.5 ) . we stayed here for two weekday nights in august for a brief staycation . check-in service was painless albeit it was a weekend day afternoon and not very busy . we were really impressed by the ambience of the hotel room ( resort room with a view of the strip ) . the modern decor matched our tastes . there was a flat screen tv with a bose wave sound clock radio . the bed , covered with plush pillows and fresh linens , was comfortable . the bathroom was great - two vanity sinks with an integrated tv ( which had bad reception ) , enclosed granite shower , a bathtub with a view of the strip ( and a electronic privacy shade if you desire ) . complementary cards were included in the suite . maid service was excellent . use of the fitness area costs $ 15 and internet costs $ 13/day which seemed rather pricey to me . i 'll post a pic of the spa prices ( note : they charge you a mandatory 20 % gratuity ! ) . the amenities include use of the pool area which was lovely . we enjoyed lazing around the pool all afternoon like two slugs . it was awesome ! the crowd there is diverse - you see kids in their lifejackets , the elderly sunning next to their wheelchairs and the young 20 somethings sporting designer shades and swimwear . the music is top 20 's with some pop favourites from the 80 's . fortunately , the music was at a comfortable decibel level . the casino itself was quiet during our weekday vacay and was relatively smoke free for a casino . also really like they did n't pump some yucky perfume in the ventilation system like other casinos on the strip . loved the free beverage fountain next to marinelli 's which was n't watered down ! ( they had fresca ! i love fresca ! ) disadvantages : well , if you do n't gamble , go to the spa , lounge in the pool or check out tina martini- there is n't much here to do unlike other local casinos which have movie theatres and bowling alleys . the location is another factor to consider because there really is n't much around the casino - plus it 's far from the strip for visitors . you 'll definitely need a car if you stay here . finally , the food does n't quite live up to level of quality at the hotel . compared to other strip casino hotels which have great restaurants there or nearby , this hotel 's food is okay but not great . overall , a really nice stay and we were glad we came to relax here . a 4.5 star review .
0	this is what you might expect from vegas , tropicana as `` fresh squeezed '' , corn syrup for maple , incredibly sweet breakfasts that if you 're 14 you might like . a mocha cappuccino was clearly made by dumping some chocolate syrup in a cup and putting it under a vending machine . the old lady next to me loved it .... doubt she uses yelp . steer clear . pleasant setting and strong wifi . ; )
1	for first timers , park along invergordon rd , south of the turn on cholla lane . do not park on cholla . it will make the local hillside folk quite sour and your car might be towed . walk up and access the trail from cholla . and , voil\u00e0 - your warm up is complete ! the reviews are correct . this side of camelback mountain is an easier hike compared to echo canyon . the terrain here is somewhat more slippery and the rock separations will test your balance and ankle strength . be sure to wear appropriate shoes to keep you steady . take your time and you can choose your own path towards the top . one of the best times to come is before sunrise . nearby parking should still be available and you should n't need a headlamp . i would shoot for a 5am start on the trailhead to get your money 's worth . the view will be wonderful . advanced challenge : do an `` over and back . '' head up cholla and go down echo canyon . drink some water and turn right 'round , baby , right 'round . back up echo and down to where you started . happy hiking phoenix !
1	macaroni and cheese with martini ... a great way to end a long day . and the music in the bar area does n't suck .
0	i go here 5 days a week for an hour somewhere between the hours of 5am-7am . its dirty . the cardio equipment is usually broken or about to be broken . bikes missing pedals . treadmills with torn pads or that literally stop moving at speed randomly in workout . morning staff cares none about faulty equipment . everytime it rains , the floor floods and no one cares or fixes it . the next year its still flooding . did n't you notice you had to shut down half the weight area floor because of the last drizzle ? ! ? the only reason i keep coming back is because its open when i need it to be .
0	the food was pretty bad . my soup was too watery . my ice cream sandwich tasted funky . everything was priced extremely poorly for the quality in my opinion . i paid $ 30 for a bowl of soup and two slices of ice cream sandwich . wtf . at least everything was edible ? if you 're in the right seats , you have a great view of the bellagio fountains though . only other plus side , it 's open 24/7 . go to earl 's .
1	my wife and i went to the waterfront tonight . had a few drinks and appitisers . the coconut shrimp is awesome . has some great habanero seasoning with the salad side . it was a lot of fun sitting outside looking over the lake and having a beer . very nice place , good food , good atmosphere , great staff .
0	we decided to go to the linq , walk around and celebrate st. patrick 's day there . chayo seemed appealing with their decoration so we decided to sit and eat lunch there . our experience was absolutely horrible . the restaurant was n't as packed as we anticipated ( for being st. patty 's day ) . when we sat , we waited a bit to be served . we placed our drinks order . we waited like 20 min for them to be delivered . we finally placed our food order and it took forever to arrive as well . we ordered chicken , fried fish , and lobster tacos to start and they were all pretty bland and simple . definitely not worth the price . when we got our tacos , we ordered some hot sauce to make them a little tasty . they took so long to bring the hot sauce that we finished every single one of our tacos ! ! when someone finally brought the hot sauce , they just dropped it off quickly and they even forgot to take the wrapper off ! so we had to do that . thanks ! great service ! we constantly had empty plates on our table . the busser would take so long to clear our table that we had glasses of beer stacked on top of each other . every time that we would order a beer , it would literally take 20 min to get it . so be aware of this ! when we finished eating the tacos ( starters ) the busser was already setting the table for dessert when we did n't even order our main course . my friend ordered the shrimp fajitas as a main course and they were extremely greasy . wish we had just gone straight to dessert instead . it really was a horrible service even though 70 % of the tables in the restaurant were empty . i would n't go back to this place at all !
0	a group of us went here to eat some burgers since we heard they had good burgers . the food was good but somewhat oily and dry . i woul of given the restaurant 4 stars if it was n't for the horrible service provided by olivia . she had a bad attitude throughout the whole time we were there for no reason at all . we asked for a to go box and she just threw it on the table , which we thought was so rude . we asked our waters to be filled 3 times before she actually got around to it . the restaurant is expensive , so i expected better service . overall , it 's worth going if you enjoy a good burger . hopefully , you get a better waitress/waiter .
0	called for the house special fried rice with chicken and shrimp and the bbq pork fried rice . both sucked . i could feel the crunch of msg on both . bbq pork had no flavor ( zero ) . house special fried rice was nothing but normal fried rice with chicken and shrimp . nothing great about the ambience . go only if you are craving for low grade asian food .
1	when that craving for some food from the island hits , there 's no escaping it . it 's a hunger like no other . luckily , over at island flavor , they give some of the largest portions that i have ever seen . it 's like hash house a go go-portions for hawaiian cuisine , except the food here is actually good . the place was a bit on the empty side around 11am on a late saturday morning . seeing an empty place on a weekend always leaves me a bit hesitant to eat somewhere . but , i had a gut instinct telling me to eat here anyway . i 'm glad i did . here 's what we went with : fried rice omelet - when this dish is served to you , it looks like a majestic mountain pile , capped at the peak with a generous amount of scrambled egg . along with it , comes three giant pieces of portuguese sausage , nestled around the edges of the plate . the fried rice , packed underneath , has to be some of the best fried rice that i 've ever had in this town . it had a bit of a unique sweet flavor to it , mixed in with some small bits of diced pork . i 'm pretty sure this serving was good enough to feed 3-4 people . i stared at this modern marvel for a few seconds before i dug in . it was beautiful sight . loco moco - another heavily portioned dish with a likewise amount of brown gravy , to boot . i sampled a bit of it . not bad ! the hamburger patty included with it was humongous , as expected . loco moco is much too heavy a dish for me to conquer on my own . i 'd probably come back for this if i wanted to drown a day of depression in gravy . huge portions , great flavors , friendly staff .. there 's is n't much more i could want in a restaurant .
1	my bf and i went to black bear for the first time yesterday based on reviews i had read . the prices seemed just a bit high but every single bit of the the food was delicious . we tried the breakfast menu , but definitely want to go back for lunch or dinner . i was in the mood to try a bit of everything , so i actually got 2 orders from the `` small '' section . a small cinnamon roll french toast , and a small combo plate with 1 egg , 1 sausage link , 1 biscut , and hash browns . it was so good that i ate everything except half the biscuit . and that was because i was simply out of room by them . the only slightly problemic thing was that my bf ordered a large orange juice and what he got was more like a small or regular . and he had to ask the waiter for it twice . yes , the juice was fresh-squeezed , but for $ 3+ we expected more .
1	i always get the rare beef pho to go and it 's always amazing ! the service is always great . the man who i always see there , i think he may be the owner , is friendly and prompt . i love this place ! the broth is super yummy . they give lots of beef unlike other pho places that give you like three pieces and send you on your way !
1	so cool ! you are able to turn your photos into polaroid style prints ! you walk in and the decor is great . there 's polaroids all over and there 's a nice large photo frame on the right that makes for some fun pictures . there 's computers all in the center of the room and these are what you use to select and print your photos . you go to the computer and create an account . it 's easy , and they do n't send you a bunch of emails . it 's strictly to print the photos . so you do this , and then you can select photos from your cell phone , facebook , instagram , etc . depending on where you 're getting the photos from , you either log onto your social media , or email the photo from your phone to your account . it pops up on the computer and you can select the photos you want to print . then you can have them vertical or horizontal . this is awesome , because some of my photos cut out faces . but i turned them horizontal and they came out just perfect . you can also type out phrases or descriptions to the bottom of the photos . search around on the internet real quick for any discount coupons . we found one for 20 % off and got our 9 photos for about $ 7 . it 's usually $ 1 per photo , which is cheap in my opinion . but the discount code is even better . there 's also a minimum purchase of 6 photos per transaction . and then from there , payment was easy . submit your order and then head to the counter to pay . they printed our pictures in about ten minutes and then they were ready ! we also got buy one get one free shadow boxes ! super cool place worth checking out while walking the strip !
0	we had a reservation on july 4 and we came few minutes early to check in . noticed a lot of people waiting and tables empty . we had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated . asked hostess what was the hold up she explained they were still seating people that had reservations 20 minutes before ours and the computer tells them who is next . got to outside table 108 out there and finally got water 10 minutes while other people seated after us got drinks and bread . dinner was ok my husband had seafood and some of the clams were not open sign of bad clam no pasta with dinner they should of not served the non-opened clams daughter 's pasta was fine sauce was good , i had lemon chicken and chicken was fatty . asked for bread sticks never got them . also outside there were steamers and they were so overpowering we could n't see and my daughter got really wet .
0	tried to come here 4 times . on the 4th time ( sunday evening ) , we snagged a seat at the labyrinth style bar . they do n't have many cocktail options and for a place that has whisky bottles hanging from the ceiling , you 'd think they would have more than 2 whiskeys ( yamazaki & nikka ) . also , for a half jigger of whiskey ( `` glass '' ) will run you 11 or 13 dollars depending on which kind you choose . we just headed down to else 's and got much better whiskeys for much cheaper . the waitress was also a bit pretentious and could n't really speak english * and * asked me to take my purse off the table even though the bar was nearly empty ( ~6 other people inside )
0	yep , it appears closed for good .
1	i love luv-it . my go to sundae is the western . lately i have branched out a bit and tried some of their flavors of the day . i might just be used to my sundaes but i prefer them over a flavor of the day in a cone . it is nice they offer different flavors though . i will still give them a try from time to time . there is almost always a line , even in the winter but there is plenty of people watching to do to pass the time . i do wish they were open a little earlier but when i first started going they were n't open 7 days a week like they are now so i will take what i can get . my fave downtown lunch is viva arepeas then dessert at luv-it . so good ! oh yeah and make sure you bring cash , if you forget there is an atm in the mini mart next door .
0	we stopped in for breakfast . the prices were high for very marginal food .... frozen potatoes that were n't even served warm . food did n't seem very fresh either . left with that heavy , ugh feeling .
1	dig the food here not fast food but really good food , everything i have tried is so amazing the carnitas burrito delicious the tacos are quality and the street corn reminds me of my trips to mexico when i was younger .
0	every time we have been here we have been disappointed . we are done . no more chances . there are much better pizza places around here .
0	read the reviews on yelp while i was visiting phoenix . i am a doo-nut fiend , so was looking for a place . lamar 's was middle of the road . i am a classic glazed donut kind of guy and i love them even more when they are hot and fresh . i think had i been there when the donuts were hot and fresh i would 've enjoyed them more . yet , it was n't bad .
0	disclaimer : i 'm lactose intolerant , so , getting pizza for me is a pretty self-destructive event . but , occasionally , i just do n't give a f * * * and head out for a night of italian pain . the location of due forni is really great . right off the 215 , in a quiet strip mall , it 's an easily accessible location . i was really surprised though because the restaurant was packed on a wednesday night . good sign . we ordered the quattro formaggio ( yeah , i hate myself ) with roman-style crust ( thin and crispy crust ) and the bianca pizza with neapolitan-style crust ( thick and chewy ) . to dull the pain , i ordered a bottle of a grenache/syrah wine mix called cashmere ( $ 48 ) . i really enjoyed the quattro formaggio , the simple flavors of the mozzarella , ricotta , etc , went really well with the light roman crust . i would definitely order this again ( well , not for awhile ... ) . i was n't a big fan of the bianca pizza , however . the heaps of salty ham overwhelmed the taste -- not a good thing since it was slightly cold and tasted like pre-packaged deli ham . bleck . both pizzas came out lightning quick , though ! do n't worry about a long wait here . because we were slightly drunk ( yup , drank the whole bottle ) , we decided to order the chocolate pizza for dessert . talk about a decadent , rich ending to a meal . neapolitan crust , chocolate , nutella , hazelnuts , strawberries , vanilla gelato , etc . very good , but i would n't recommend it if you order pizza as an entree . i felt very crust overloaded . overall , i enjoyed it more than settebello . pizza , obviously , is n't my thing but i think this place is one of the better spots in town . i 'll definitely go back for some wine !
0	i really did n't like the vibe here , not gon na lie . i will say this ... it 's amazing that blue martini has wrangled a good scene for themselves . i came here on a wednesday night/thursday morning at like 2am , and it was packed wall to wall . they were charging $ 10 cover , and there was a quick line . did n't even get a drink it was so annoyingly packed with douchebags , so i probably wo n't be back , or at least not at night . my buddy said wednesdays are ladies night , hence all of the craziness , and it 's much chiller on a friday night . maybe i 'll give that a shot sometime .
0	nothing to get excited about . the food is ok but do n't go out of your way to visit this place .... the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at filbertos . at least the dinning room is nice , clean , and comfortable . ( unlike many other places in aj ) .
0	i really want to love cakes on walnut . i really do . i 'm a fan of cupcake places up in chicago , but cakes on walnut can not compare to any of the places there . i gave this place 3 chances , and all three times i left feeling meh . for a cupcake place , the selection was poor . my cupcake tasted good , but not good enough for a place that specializes in cupcakes.there was n't a lot of varieties , and the price was on a slightly inflated side . besides the cupcakes , which is supposed to be the main attraction , there 's not much draw to the place there besides the ample seating . maybe i 'll give this place a 4th chance sometimes , but i feel like i should spend my money at pekara ( for pasteries ) or kopi ( for drinks ) instead .
0	it 's nothing fancy , but cafe cortez does serve up a great burger ! although i had stayed in the hotel for a couple of nights , i did n't pay attention to the cafe until my co-workers and i were looking for a lunch spot one day and saw their sign on the sidewalk for $ 5 burger and beer . the first time we went in , we were in a rush , which made us feel like the service was slow , but in reality , this is actually a great lunch spot ! so we all got the $ 5 burger and beer deal ( which is offered all day every day ) . note , if you want to add cheese , it 's an additional $ 0.50 . the meal comes with a bag of lays potato chips and if you want to substitute for fries , then it 's an additional $ 2 . you can also substitute the beer for a soda ( with no extra charge ) . first of all , you ca n't go wrong with $ 5 . you ca n't even get a meal at mcdonalds/in-n-out/burger king , etc . for $ 5 ! on top of that , this was a freshly grilled burger ( decent sized , i think 1/2 lb ) with fresh vegetables and a beer ( bud , bud light or a dark , greek beer ) in a sit down restaurant . it was good enough that we even went back the next day . i ended up getting the mushroom swiss burger the next day because i wanted fries . oh , and i forgot to mention that when you sign up for the el cortez player 's card , you get a $ 5 off coupon at the cafe . so that meant that my $ 5 burger and beer was free !
0	waiting for the connection flight , i decided to get a beer . i found the home turf bar , which was right next to my gate . i was n't hungry and just wanted a quick beer before my flight . they had shocktop , which is okay with me . it was an okay place to pass the time before it was time to move on .
0	pizza is great but this place is overpriced for what it is .
0	at first we were happy to see a red bowl withing golf cart driving distance in sun city . the bloom is now off that red rose . a luncheon for one of our clubs worked out . it was not crowded , the food arrived together and was just fine . my hopes rose as we had not been back for months after three bad experiences . well , good was not to last . two more dinner occasions and the tastes were just `` off . '' their fusion is not working well . the blends of shrimp , chicken and scollops tasted as if dish soap was mixed in . another evening , which my wife insisted we go back to eat , i ordered a simple pork fried rice and could only eat a small portion . how do you screw up fried rice ? the pork was greasy , much of the rice hard and crunchy and it was gummy . ahhhhhh ! we will not be back . how sad as the charlotte location seemed to get it right , but i am not going back there for a comparison , either . bye , bye red bowl indian land .
0	i come from socal and this place would never survive there . nonetheless , this is the only place that i could find decent sponge cake in vegas , and their pineapple custard buns are really good . the zong zi are bleh ( filled with green bean , egg yolk and pork , but not much of any of those things ) and not very fresh ( we asked about the red bean zong zi and the lady that worked there actually told us not to buy it because it was really old ) . the egg custard tars are also really tiny . the steamed red bean buns are really really good though , and did i mention already that the pineapple custard buns are absolutely delicious ? also , be sure to come in here early to get the full selection - we went at around 3 in the afternoon twice , and all they had left was sponge cake and egg custard tarts .
0	there is nothing i liked about this place at all , i came here because it was close by and had good reviews , however i am not sure why it does . i shared four sushi rolls with my sister and only sort of liked one of them . one had so much mayo on it i felt like i was just putting a spoonful of mayo in my mouth ( i think it was called the super spicy roll . ) it is also a very tiny place . tables are so close together it makes it uncomfortable to talk to the person you are dining with ... also it took a very long time to get our food soooo yeah i would not go back !
0	pretty bad . i was given 2 applebee 's gift certificates , meaning i 've been forced there multiple times . the food : it 's typical applebee 's food , not great , just good ... although , my coveted artichoke dip was cold last time . alcohol : the bartender 's suck , i ordered a `` long beach '' two separate times and the first time it tasted purely of tequila ( wtf ? ) , the second time i ordered it with a kicker ( that the bartender recommended ) but it tasted purely of sugar ... and i do n't mind sugary drinks but this was bad . the service : probably the best part of the restaurant , very friendly in my experience ( the reason for the second star ) . management : incredibly unorganized , managers clearly disliked their jobs , one told us how ghetto the clientele is ... which is probably true considering some of the stories i 've heard ... in essence , the food is hit or miss , the alcohol sucks , and literally most of the management hates their lives ... do yourself a favor and go somewhere where there 's a little tlc put into the place ...
0	you 'd expect a better range of stores located here but you wo n't find it . we were fighting the crowds and all we found were the usual stuff like kenneth cole , ann taylor , bcbg -- nothing out of the ordinary . on top of that you 'll be trying to fight through the people standing around watching tourists go on a gondola ride . parking sucks too because the venetian is such a popular hotel that their valet parking fills up rather quickly and then it becomes available for hotel guests only . you 'll have to make your way to the self parking which is a horrendous 10-floor structure . once you 've parked , you 'll have to maneuver your way to the elevators where you will be fighting more people to finally get to the shopping area . the worse part is getting back to your car because there will be a line waiting to get into the elevators . horrible horrible place to shop . go to the forum shops instead .
0	so this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom . almost could n't even sit down to go . ( yuck ) ok on to the rest . the chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice . the numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans . the only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa . it was so bland . i do n't know that it was worth the $ 3 parking validation we came for . my friend and i love mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere , my suggestion go elsewhere .
0	oh where do i begin ... so we arrive -- 10 min before our reservation time of 9p . we did n't get seated until 40 min after the hour . to be squeezed in a booth -- set up for 6. although our party is of 7. asked for an additional place setting 2x before received . the waiter , an underaged looking young man , id 's us after getting our drink order , and takes 15-20 min to return with said drinks . and serves us tap water after clearly stating bottled . the food ... sushi- subpar ... the entrees- burnt ... he said it was `` smoked '' ... yea no , it 's burned buddy . drinks - weak ! the people ... so , this woman has her child .. yes child ... sitting at the table with underwear and no shoes and she 's making out with this gentleman while her child is damn near naked . ( side eye ) shall i say .. never again !
1	i have renounced my former hatred of this bar . you must go on sundays and monday 's because jason the bartender plays ( real ) punk rock and he knows so much about all of the beer choices . thursdays are great because another bartender plays some hip yet classy jazz music . the beer selections are quirky and unique , a different direction than the sophis neighbor the roosevelt 's elegant beer menu . you must go in there and get the strangest brew you can fathom drinking . it will be cool . plus , this is my number one pick for the best bar to go sit and chat at . it 's a place to sit and talk and hear some kick ass music . so , after going a few times , i am convinced , i really like this bar . go ahead , do n't let the endless stream of hipsters scare you ...
0	the waiter is very cold , may be too tired ? they charge you a split fee $ 15 without telling you in advance , when you find out , they will then show you on the menu with very tiny small words . they recommended you the best selection is the surf & turf , but the lobster is very dry and tough , fillet mignon is dry too ! it 's very strange , because i went there few years ago , the rib-eye is very tender juicy before , may be they change the chef , or the famous chef did n't cook anymore .... it was a big disappointment for us . surf & turf $ 79 did n't worth it . the revolving tower provides good view .
0	yummy spot . went here with the in-laws after some golf . the hot & sour soup is delicious , as is their sweet & sour combo and chicken lo mein . my only `` complaint '' is that the chicken lo mein noodles were spaghetti size and i was really looking for the wide fat egg noodles ( chow fun , i guess ) ... this is most likely an error on my part because i had a hard time hearing the waitress 's response to my question and was going by body language and hand gestures . no matter , it was delicious anyway , the prices are awesome ( check out the combo meals ) and their iced tea is very good and freshly brewed .
0	wait . wait some more . i hope it 's worth the wait . still waiting . the hostesses have attitudes , why ? so hungry . still waiting . glare from hostess . wait . was that my stomach making that noise ? wait some more . do i hear the theme song to jeopardy in my head ? finally , our table is ready ! i am starving , so i will let the rude hostesses slide , lets do this ! i order the vegan burger , which i know you are now thinking to yourself , what a dumb veggie head and you will now discount my whole review ....... well here it is . it was just meh and i have had better . all the veggies were grilled but the whole thing was so greasy that i had to use a fork to eat it . what did n't help it was the side of fries that were cold . so looking back on my evening , i should have just stuck to ordering a milkshake and possibly that would have turned this into a three star review , maybe .
1	uncle bears is pretty standard as far as breweries go . the food was what you would expect , filling and somewhat greasy . the service was great , she was very patient with me wanting to try multiple beers before picking one that i liked . it 's also pretty cool that they allow dogs on the patio ! san tan and four peaks are better , but overall it was n't a bad place .
0	we booked the renovated go room and it was better than we expected . the decor was modern and had a denon hi-fi system in the room ! bathroom had a bathtub and a shower . reasonably clean . i was n't too crazy about the strange smell in the casino ( felt like bathroom air freshener ! ) , but hey with the price and its unbeatable central location , it was a good deal ! plus you 're in vegas , you would n't want to just stay in your room or your own hotel !
0	great service . large portions . a bit tricky to find the place in the dark but it 's worth it .
0	une des pires places pour d\u00e9jeuner . service trop long ( 40 minutes pour une petite cr\u00eape et quelques toasts . et le sumum : 2 cheveux trouv\u00e9s dans notre plat .... immonde . \u00c0 \u00e9viter .
0	i do n't understand how this rates so high . as other reviewers have said , this is not good sushi . it 's edible ( thus the 2 star rating ) , but it 's not great . i have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure i was n't missing anything , and each time i 've been only mildly satisfied . they do not serve real crab , their rolls fall apart , and the service is not that great . maybe i 'm going at the wrong time ? i have been there during lunch time each time i 've gone and have not been impressed at all . on the 3rd try , my friend and i decided that we would not be returning any more .
0	i called in advance to make sure they were in network with metlife . i was told that they were and gave them all of my insurance information . i was a new patient , and my insurance covers 1 yearly checkup with x-rays and 2 cleanings a year 100 % with no copays . after my cleaning i was informed that i had $ 115 charge for the cleaning . i asked why and was told that i had a ppo plan ( which i knew ) and that i could pick anyone i wanted but that they only got paid 80 % on `` their status . '' in other words , they were not in network . two weeks later i received a bill for another $ 57 dollars . so now they want $ 172 copay after my insurance already paid several hundred dollars . i had no unusual procedures , just a regular cleaning . the doctor was great , but clearly his administrative staff have no clue what they are doing when it comes to insurance . i could have seen many other doctors without insurance and paid the $ 79.99 new patient cleaning and x-rays fee , with no insurance and saved money . i have left a message for the office regarding the additional $ 57 which i have no intention of paying as $ 167 dollar copay on a several hundred dollar cleaning ( after they billed my insurance ) is ridiculous . i am still waiting for a return phone call . the doctor and the dental staff were great , do n't get me wrong , they just need to hire some people who know who they are in network with and not just roll the dice with new patients .
1	nyam nyam is a really friendly italian restaurant which offers great food and service for its prices . it 's less than a minute 's walk from george square and so is ideal for satisfying any post-class huger pangs . it feels inviting inside with its cosy size and comforting decor which makes you feel right at home . their menu is excellent with plenty of authentic italian dishes ranging from calzones to homemade ice cream . i went for the spaghetti carbonara which was delicious and creamy . the smoked bacon which they use is amazing and enfuses the whole dish . they 're not stingy with their portion sizes either and i 'd recommend it for lunch or dinner any day !
0	stopped in for a quick dinner . had the sushi combo 2 for $ 18 , with a spicy tuna roll . felt it was just alright , nothing terrible but i would n't want to order it again . service was great though .
0	for the past two sundays , i 've come here to hang out for a couple of hours while my son is at a church function . i enjoy watching the sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two . last night i decided to grab a bite to eat . i was dining by myself and wanted some finger food . after browsing the menu for a few minutes , i decided to go with the nachos ( $ 10.50 ) . to wash it down , i had an iced tea . i watched the giants/bears game while i waited for my grub ...... it did n't take too long before it came .... the waitress delivered the nachos and they were a friggin ' mountain of nachos ! ( see pics ) seriously ..... i 'm not opposed to large portions , but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people ! i was a little pissed because i did n't want to eat that much and the waitress did n't say anything ..... also the menu did n't mention the gargantuan size of the nachos either . i reacted by saying `` damn , that 's a friggin ' mountain of food ! `` ..... she replied `` i know '' ...... well if you knew , why did n't you say something when i ordered it ? ! this is where i am torn .... do i knock off a star because of this ? or not ? i personally feel that it 's the server 's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this .... especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu . back to the food .... the nachos were topped with melted cheddar cheese , jalapenos , guacamole , sour cream , onions , olives , tomatoes . the thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate .... another faux pas from the server is that she did n't offer me a smaller plate to eat my nachos ..... she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig . i tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so i asked her for a plate , which she brought over right away . the nachos flavor was n't spectacular , it was bleh . the cheese was n't gooey .... it was melted , but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the nachos without using a fork . also , it was top heavy with the toppings .... meaning after the 1st layer of nachos , there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections . what 's the point of this dish then ? i do n't know ..... i felt bad because i did n't even come close to finishing it and it was n't worth taking home ...... what a waste of food . i took off 1 star because of the bad service ..... still a great place to catch a game . i 've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences , but was an inactive yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated . will i return ? because of my favorable history with big dog 's , i will give them another chance ..... next time i 'm asking the server how large the portion is .
0	prices are high . to be expected from starbs . i only come to this location if i am 30 minutes early on the way to work . the last 8 times ive come here , the drive thru takes 11 to 16 minutes . * i am not a fan of close quarters job interviews and yoga moms talking about their busy days ahead so i do n't wander inside . their processes need to change ... i.e. , i get to the window , hand her my debit card , she swipes it while holding my drink .... takes another person 's drive thru order .... attempts an upsell , sets my drink down , hands me my card back ... then turns around and remembers my drink ....... the workers are usually pretty friendly and not the run of the mill `` i 'll get that to go please '' .... '' was that for here or to go ? '' types .
1	the veal tartar was off the hook and the service was really good . great wine selection as well . if you find yourself in montreal this will be a wonderful treat .
0	positives : * the waitress was very nice . * they were open on christmas eve . negatives : * the waitress was not remotely competent . * the beer was skunked . * the fries -- which took 15 minutes to arrive -- were pale and ice cold .
0	the espresso is n't all that bad and the selection of pastries is pretty good . i 'll give them credit for their creativity in the dessert area . they have some very cute looking desserts . cheesecakes and cannoli are a basic staple here . with the only other espresso place being starbucks it 's worth supporting this place . if you 're looking for it ... it 's in the downstairs food court area inside the ny ny casino . it 's kinda tucked in the back . the nice part is that if you 're staying at the hotel , it 's pretty much at the base of the new yorker elevators which makes it convenient for getting coffee and crawling back to your room .
0	we stopped coming here , there are just too many large dogs roaming leash-free with little or no supervision . i reported to animal control and park police . large dog poo all over the place too . we now drive extra 10 mins to a park in seven hills , much much better well kept park with more respectable dog owners .
0	i have to fall somewhere in the middle on this place . elie 's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service , but it falls a little short in the food department . i can walk to this place from my work , so i decided to do just that one day last week . alicia b was definitely right when she said that this place is `` dinky '' - the flooring is old , the tables are dingy , the bathroom is passable , and the `` decor '' consists of a few potted plants and some framed stock pictures of greece . i might forgive the extreme lack of atmosphere if i felt that the prices were reasonable , since that would mean that the owners were skimping on style in order to provide a high-quality product . unfortunately , the food does n't quite deliver , especially given the high prices . i really wanted to order one of the vegetarian combo plates , but the cheapest one with falafel ( plus hummus ) was $ 7.85 ! that is really steep , in my opinion . if i had wanted to add baba and tabouli , it would have run me $ 9.10 . because this felt high , i ended up getting the falafel sandwich for $ 5.59 . it only came with lettuce , tomatoes , and tahini sauce , so i ended up adding green peppers for $ .45 ( a bargain compared to the $ .99 they charge to add tomatoes ) . i waited 10-15 minutes for my food , which i understand given that there was a steady flow of eat-in and take-out customers . when the sandwich did arrive ( with a smile from the again very friendly owner ) , i enjoyed it because i was starving , but again , was n't all too impressed . the pita was very large but very dry , and it definitely could have stood to be more moist . similarly , i found the falafel overly dry and crumbly . the tahini sauce was decent but not as subtle as some i 've had in the past . for $ 8 or so , i got a filling falafel sandwich and a large diet coke . i definitely prefer the $ 2.99 falafel sandwich at al-hana , although the uber-convenient location of elie 's may mean that i return a few more times . i will definitely update if i go back and try something more on-point .
0	ick . i wanted regular bbq wings with regular bbq sauce and they put hot sauce in the bbq . the vinegar on hot wings gives me a headache so i can only eat bbq . she kept trying to tell me that i wanted them medium heat .. i dunno .. not going there again i dont think .. at least not to eat
1	this was a great show wally the mc was the highlight . worth the price i loved every minute
0	i had a red bean bun , a cake roll , and a fried bun with curry flavor vegetables stuffed . all the them were not bad , but they do n't taste that good to justify the price . everything here is pretty expensive . i am a big fan of pastry and i have had better bread with lower price than i encountered here at crown bakery . i really like to try the shaved ice that they sell here , but at $ 7 a bowl , i really doubt that i will ever .
0	i ca n't say anything about the food/drinks ( as we never got to order any ) , but the service here was by far the worst i 've ever had . i went with a group of people , and we were seated outside . this was understandable , as they were busy , but we had planned on staying for a while . i figured asking to be moved inside when they had open space would n't be a problem . i was wrong . after waiting over 15 minutes from initially being seated , the waiter finally comes around . i asked him to be put on a waiting list to be moved inside . he very snobbishly tells us we probably ca n't , but he would ask . another 15 minutes later another employee comes by and basically tells us there 's no guarantees of us being able to move inside ... yet i saw many open tables that they placed other people at . the group i was with and i decided to leave before even placing an order . i do n't care how good people claim the food and drinks are here i will never come back .
0	i 'm a fan of the hard rock- great casino , great selection of restaurants and bars , and lots of good looking people . stayed there earlier this week , and got upgraded to a ridiculous suite complete with a pool table , and 3 lcd tvs . it was pretty cool . s why only 3 stars ? paying $ 15 a day for internet is horse shit . if the comfort inn across the street can manage it for free , you should be able to as well . pretty big turn off for business travelers . has another problem with the tvs not working either , the people that had our room before had swiped the batteries and unplugged everything .
0	not a fan of the decor or the ambience as another reviewer mentioned . the music was way too loud and crappy ; no way we would ever , ever eat in there . take-out is a must . the food is quite good , but does take a long time to get to you ; over 10 minutes usually , without a line in front of you . we waited over 25 minutes one time , but it was a lunch rush . still that was a long time to stand . it is more of a grilled wrap , than a burrito , as another review mentions . tasty though . no debit though . seriously ? it 's 2011 , get with the times boyz . and the parking sucks ; angled parking which you have to drive over a sidewalk to get to . pro tip : do n't run over any pedestrians when backing out .
0	the man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me , rude , and then threw ( literally ) my clothes into a basket as i walked away . i asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me `` they 're fine '' . i promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to denny 's on mattis . last time i use any starcrest dry cleaning .
1	i 've been going to niro 's for over 5+ years . i think the gyro is really good . being from chicago , we love our gyro so i 'm glad this place is near my home . if you get the double gyro plate , they give you a lot of meat . just wish they would give you 4 pitas since 2 is not enough .
0	well just having spent the past weekend at the valley ho , it was interesting to compare the two hotel concepts and restaurants . both being old outdated hotels remodeled into somewhat trendy urban hot spots . i walked into the lobby and was pleasantly surprised by the decor . artsy in a `` raw '' sort of way . exposed ceilings , cheap local art for purchase on the walls , a view of the really cool pool area , then walked into the `` gallo blanco '' . i was 1 of 2 people there . i sat at the bar i sat down and scanned the menu that was on the chalkborarded walls . the server handed me a wine list . i had vino blanco from argentina . it was ice cold and served in what appeared to be a riedel `` o '' glassware.i liked this . things are going well at this point . then i ordered just one fish taco . i was n't real hunger so this small taco was the perfect size . it was served on a small corn tortilla , the fish was halibut and it was nicely grilled . if i ordered it again i would have them hold the white sauce that tasted like `` miracle whip '' ? ? the fish was so fresh , it would have been perfect with just the avocado , and lettuce . conversation was going fine with the server unitl for some reason he asked my age , which i thought was odd . then from there the conversation digressed into some political and philosophical debate ? ? i was just looking to unwind with some vino and food and to relax . i guess i may give gallo blanco another shot to try some other things on the menu , but i would probably bring a friend along next time , and avoid the politics : )
0	this review is for the restaurant side of the business . brought the family here because we had heard good things about the place . when you walk in you 're immediately hit with cigarette smoke . it was like standing near a huge ash tray it just was nasty . because the bar is separated from the restaurant they 're are no waitress in the restaurant side . we had to wait more than 5 minutes for someone to show up . we almost left but finally a waitress showed up and seated us . i ordered the steak dinner and i 'll just say i wish i would 've ordered something else . the steak tasted like it was cooked on the street out back . really tough and just tasted rank . i asked for medium and got super well done . my wife ordered the same thing and asked for medium also and hers was more done than mine ! i ca n't comment on the rest of the food because we do n't plan on going back . i have heard the bar portion is a lot better but i do n't know personally . just for the smell alone is enough for me not to go back .
0	one thing i 'll appreciate at any gay bar outside of new york city/la and occasionally san francisco ... the drinks are cheaper ( score ! ) . so , the boys and i , after a very unfortunate first attempt at exploring gay phoenix/tempe/scottsdale on a thursday night , were very happy to run into amsterdam . nice decor , lovely outdoor space with the ever so classy tequila bottle lights , and good service . they play good music and the guys are cute ... although , i do n't think i 've ever seen so much hair product in my life . it 's like woman and their chest as they get older and using a bra .... i think gay men fear that their hair will start to sag over years of fighting gravity , so they have hair product to give it support ( but even i know when a push up bra is pushing up just a little too much ) ! also , kind of a negative point ... definitely sensed some attitude at this bar . the guys here seem very into themselves . just an observation , take that and do with it what you will . some helpful tips ... on saturday night , i believe it 's no-cover before midnight ... they serve plastic cups at the outdoor bar instead of glass ( not really a deal breaker , but in case you 're curious ) , and the dance floor is kind of unimpressive .
0	the owner is the only one with any talent and you need to catch her on a good day . i went to this place a total of 5 times . i got 1 good haircut from the owner and the next two that she did were nowhere near as good . i even had to fix an obviously too long piece that did not fit with the rest of my bangs . i switched to another girl who did a not great job the first time and i went back thinking she just needed to get to know my hair . ha ! the second time she not only slaughtered the haircut but really did a terrible color . number one lesson girls , do n't cut a person 's hair too short on top if it 's fine , especially fine and curly . i did complain especially about the color and she put a glosser on it that made the `` caramel '' ( read brassy yellow ) highlights look less like a peroxide bottle exploded in my direction , for a few shampoos , but eventually it faded back to that horrible color job and seriously dried out my hair . i have n't been back to this place in a while but i still remember how ugly i felt for months and months after that last horrible cut and color . i saw that i had never posted this review from a while back so i went ahead and posted it now . it deserves to be posted when i still feel like crying just reading my old draft of a review . this place is seriously not worth $ 200+ the skill of the hairdressers is on par with a jc penney salon- new hire !
0	the bagels are so-so , which is not a great thing if you 're called `` the bagel factory . '' the atmosphere is nice and so are the people .
1	went looking for a sonoran dog and heard this place had a phoenix dog that was close to a sonoran dog . it was further then i use go for food but closest place with a sonoran dog . it was yummy ! ! ! so were the onion rings . not over priced either . the hot dogs are all beef and deep fried . very clean and nice services .
0	they should put the flies on the menu ! we went for lunch and were bothered by so many flies that it ruined the meal . just be prepared !
0	mediocre chinese restaurant in madison . cliff and i came here for a cheat meal after a long cleanse . we ordered the black pepper deep fried chicken , garlic eggplant , and a seafood soup . the chicken was very disappointing ; normally , chinese restaurants fry this chicken dish by the whole , but fugu skimped out . they gave us the nasty little parts of the chicken ( including cartilage and god knows what else ) , heavily battered them , and fried them - so each bite consisted of crunchy dough and oil . a few pieces into the dish i started to question if they were even serving me actual chicken . the seafood soup was a miss . it was heavily salted and tasted as if they dumped frozen seafood inside an msg loaded broth . the eggplant was the only decent dish . i tasted sweet chili sauce more than anything else ( did n't taste the garlic at all , so the name was misleading ) . though it actually made me want to finish my rice . aside from everything else , i feel like fugu needs to chill with the red chili peppers and hot chili oil . they drench that in every single goddamn dish that when you finish and look at the plate , you realize that half of it consisted of red peppers .
0	we ate here because of convenience and location . we were at the lake , hungry , and not ready to go home yet . they have an okay menu selection , but i would never go out of my way to go back .
0	if a neighborhood chicago bar had gambling , this would be it . the low-limit tables are the only asset i can see . go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune .
1	great carnitas ! very tender , crispy char on the outside but juicy inside . i asked for their salsa verde to go with it and my nose was running and mouth was burning ! what a great meal . dos equis on draft helped cool it down .
1	i have been to kincaid 's for business and pleasure and all the times i have gone there , its been fantastic , classy , and delicious . thumbs up !
1	this starbucks is very close to work so very convenient . i absolutely adore this english lady with her even more adorable english accent ! ! ! i love it when she takes my order . every once in a great while i get a drink that 's not mine but they offer a replacement and if i want a free one for next time . friendly , clean and great service . `` ca n't get that with satellite ! ''
1	we come here every time we go to vegas . who would n't love donning a bib as an excuse to be as messy as a baby ? after securing your bib you put on your plastic gloves and boom you 're ready to demolish some sea creatures for an hour or two ! the food comes out happily swimming in one of their five house sauces , and you order by the pound . plop ! see through plastic bags of shrimp , mussels , crawfish , lobster , will be thrown on the table and your mission begins . it 's an exported louisiana style dining experience ! i recommend getting the hot n juicy sauce , at mild spiciness . it 's by far the tastiest and their mild spicy level has a deceivingly strong kick . this is for garlic lovers only , and is not a low sodium meal ! this year the crawfish were smaller and out of season , so they were made from frozen and not as fresh . the shrimp were large and excellent as always , and served with the head on . mmm , brains . for mussels order the green mussels over the black , they will be larger and more flavorful . great for groups and sharing , but also fun for a date with some hands on eating !
0	well i came to yelp for help before booking my christmas dinner this year in vegas . maybe it was because it was christmas but i was severely underwhelmed by this place . the decor is very nice , very trendy chic but personally i prefer my steakhouses a bit more cozy . there are some booths in the middle of the restaurant but the tables around the edges of the rooms are n't big enough for the plates . we had : caesar salad : made table side with the dressing made from scratch . it was ok and a portion big enough for 2 as an appetizer - very garlicky though fois gras something something : meh ... served with caramelized apples . the presentation was pretty but the taste was so so and definitely did n't justify the price tag . petit filet : good but not that hot when it arrived rib eye : decidedly average , a bit sinewy mashed potatoes : these were good charred broccoli : good flavor but a bit chewy flan : this was disappointing , it was really dense not light like i was expecting . but the bread served before the appetizers was great ! hahaha ... the service was just ok too , the wine waiter did n't seem to be able to recommend anything for my pallet and the best of the bunch was the guy that filled up our water glasses ! generally , this place seemed just a tad too happy with itself . but i guess that 's an easy trap to fall into in vegas . next time i 'll go back to hugo 's cellar , it 's worth the trip downtown .
0	i waited over a year to re-try this place . the theory was : if they stayed in business this long maybe they 've fixed things . the menu is better with more selections . service is slow which does n't mix well with airport crowds . there are too many tables per sq foot and people consistently walk into table . good place to go if the world runs out of restaurants . food was 2 star service 1 star ambiance 1 star , ( because zero is n't permitted )
1	the food was great , relatively cheap and prepared quickly . i was n't extremely hungry so i ordered the hummus topped with gyro . man ! i could n't have ordered anything better . the hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender . i would order this dish over and over again . served with their really good pita bread , it was a perfect meal .
1	from my initial phone call to find out the procedure to have my baby repaired , i was extremely impressed . you see my `` baby '' was struck from behind by a sweet elderly woman who was happy to accept fault by having her insurance fix it . being new to the las vegas , i began my search for reputible auto body shops on yelp . my search turned up four shops in my very immediate area , so i figured this should be easy when i called other competitors , they were dry , rushed , or robotic . i setup appointments at three other places . one was nice , but overcharging for repairs . the next place was unstructured and had me there 25 minutes past my appointment before they looked at my vehicle , and rudely handed me the estimate without asking for my business . i was starting to get discouraged and frustrated . i refused to take my car anywhere that would not be inviting because i ask a great deal of questions . however , when i called service king , an angelic voice answered , explained the process fully , and even reassured me that they were willing to take care of me right away , no appointment necessary ! upon arriving the receptionist/assistant , nancy , greeted me with the same friendly smile in person that she had in her voice over the phone . she introduced me to david biggs , who was equally as welcoming and professional . in minutes , he had my damage assessed , estimated , and sent to my insurance liaison by 8am the next morning . it 's always the small things that matter to me . i asked david if he could install a pair of new reverse lights bulbs that i had been unable to do myself , and he assured me that he would have the pros in the shop do it , and would be happy to bill separately . once i received the call from state farm , i dropped my car off for repair . if you have a need and coverage for a rental car , be sure to tell your insurance company to use hertz . that way you can take advantage of kimberly 's great customer service ... right next door ! keep in mind though , my mind was blown from the world class service and convenience , but i did n't expect a call a few days later from david with a progress report and a promised completion date . so my pick up day came , very quickly i might add , and i could not have been more satisfied . my car was repaired perfectly and cleaned inside out . and remember those reverse lamps ? well david told me it was on the house , no charge ! please do not hesitate to take your `` baby '' here . in my estimation , no one else comes close .
1	first time here , just got two gyros with salad . everything was very good , meat did not seem `` microwaved '' and the pita was soft and slightly crispy . salad was fresh . the woman behind the counter and the one who served us could n't have been nicer , coming to check on us a few times . finally , my so wanted some more pita and tzatziki , went to order it and they gave him a couple w/sauce on the house . maybe the place was just having a bad day when the very unhappy reviewer visited ? they seemed very friendly and competent tonight and the food was very good . will def be back .
1	i 'd give it a 4.5 dinner 1/25/10 the prime rib loft is up on the second floor . it is a good sized open room with one end overlooking the casino floor . the walls are painted with cabaret-nightclub scenes . we did not have reservations , but it was not very busy , but hey , it was 6:30 pm on a monday evening . this is still a pretty casual restaurant , so both of us felt comfortable wearing jeans . we had a nice booth . service was excellent . hubby had the bourbon street chicken , which he said was excellent . he 's not a big chicken fan either , but trying to follow dr 's orders somewhat . i had the filet of beef oscar . cooked perfectly and to die for . so enjoyable . very , very good meal , but be aware - the garlic mashed potatoes scream with garlic - too much for us . the baked potato would have been a better choice for us . $ 50.00 ( excluding tip ) for the two of us including a bud & glass of white zinfindel . ended up kinda funny neither of us ordered prime rib for which the restaurant is known for ....... highly recommend .
0	first visit to this upscale restaurant that appears to have been newly renovated . the design/decor was great , but the atmosphere was a little odd as the numerous tv 's around seemed to fight w/ the upscale expectation/pricing . the service was disappointing as we had to ask for silverware , salt & pepper , lemons for our water , etc . i expected more at this price point . the valet service was evidently not working this nt ( which is odd for a sat ) , but there seemed to be a garage next door . the menu was not what shows up on yelp . the server could n't remember them having some of these items ever and blamed it on having had 4 chefs over the last several years ? ! in any case , the food was mostly good and well-proportioned/prepared . they did n't serve bread ( or at least did n't ask if we wanted some ) and the salads were just ok. the tenderloin was the best part of the meal ! the wine list was ok , but it always bugs me when u ca n't get a bottle of the wine you ordered ( and enjoyed ) by the glass . seems illogical to me . with so many choices in scottsdale , this place had better step it up if they 're going to survive . ( i would have given a 2.5 , but could n't figure out how to do so . )
0	i have been to zen 32 so many times i ca n't count them all . when i first started eating sushi ( my second experience was here ) i came to zen 32 with some friends . i was still afraid of sushi so i got the teryaki chicken which i must say was quite good . i ate a bit of sushi on that first visit and i began to get hooked . if i had reviewed zen 32 after my first visit or two i would have given in a 5. i like the atmosphere and there is something about the outfits the waitresses are forced to wear that still appeals to me . the service has always been good and i enjoy that they have seating both indoors and outdoors . now for the food . first , i know this will seem odd , but the water is too lemony for my taste . it kills me . i really only drink water , and i like it to be nice and bland and zen 32 just does n't do it for me . as for the sushi , i find that it is a bit hit or miss . i do n't know if i have ever had a better tootsie roll . it is like dessert . i have tried many others , but i will always go back to zen 32 for the tootsie roll . their other rolls are fine , but i am not in love . now that i have branched out in the sushi realm , i have found that i can find better . so , in the end , will i go back to zen 32 again . yes . is it my first choice ? not quite .
0	i was referred by a friend and have had nothing but trouble with this office . in november i found out i was pregnant and was having issues before my first appt ; i had an emergency and had to get in right away and ended up seeing another doc . i wo n't give names , but that doctor basically beat around the bush to tell me i was miscarrying instead of telling me flat out . my husband literally played 20 questions with that doc to get a simple answer . it was ridiculous . also in novemeber i had the office call me on two different ocassions to reschedule because they made a `` scheduling error '' . as far as i 'm concerned thats something they should fix since people take time off to make appts in the first place . fast forward to today , another emergncy appt and i just got a phone call from them that they canceled my appt . i am so furious with the way that they run this office . try and make your schedule work , do n't cancel people . i 'm livid and would not return here if you paid me to !
1	my daughter and i have been wanting to try this place for awhile . so today we finally decided to come for lunch . items tried : shrimp & veggie fresh spring rolls and watermelon slush with boba . both items were yummy ! = ) the staff was very friendly and food came out shortly after ordering . looking foward to trying other items on the menu .
0	not too happy . got a gel manicure and pedicure , charged $ 3 to take off gel . just soaked hands in acetone , did not do wonders for my hands , never charged at any other place to take off gel . manicure and pedicure was fine but literally next day both feet had issues . for sure i got infections on both feet ( large toes ) from pedicure . not sure if tools were clean or not but next day i knew i was in trouble . dealing with this for the last 3 weeks . very painful . will not be back .
0	we had localdines deal we used to check it out for the first time . well , be careful when going to a place that automatically charges a gratuity . typically this means the service will be sub-par at best . bingo ! it took forever to get our first drinks . so long we had time to read through the whole menu . he did seem nice enough , but just mosied around the place . it really was n't terribly busy . ordered the hamberguesa and the grilled fish tacos . the fish tacos were good , but the hamberguesa will leave you feeling the results later ... ah ! anyway , it took so long to get a second round of drinks one of us went to the bar to cancel order and ask for the check . we were already done eating by then . he did ask if everything was okay , so nice attempt , but we just wanted to leave after seeing the bill included the tip . it does not create incentive for giving exceptional service . this town is tough for restaurants !
1	i love this place and their selections ! they always have red velvet unlike the places that switch out their flavors ( ahem , ahem mojo , yogurtology , etc ) ! ! ! ! ! their newest featured flavors are the bananalicious and hawaiin something and their both delish ! the only reason they didnt get 5 stars from me is because ...... they dont freaking have juice poppers ! ! ! ! how do you not have juice poppers ! ? everyone loves juice poppers ! ! !
0	this place is terrible . the help is rude . i have been here three times and walked out the last time after the bartender stood around and talked to his buddies instead of serving my date and i. i know it is new , maybe it will get better .
1	friends ask : what 's your favorite car ? i say : hands down , super cars ! who does n't drool for the exotics ? ! friends go on to tell me that there 's a track in which you can drive them as fast as you want , yadda yadda . me : no brainer ! of course i want in ! ! if you ca n't be behind the wheel for whatever reason , hey , you can be a back-seat driver ! as i was waiting for my turn i saw a few people riding as a passenger alongside a real race car driver . i felt their excitement just by looking at their expressions as they got out of the car . they sure got the ride of a lifetime ! most of the employees here are a friendly bunch . they know what they are doing and seem to enjoy their jobs . the owner was on duty that day and noticed we were waiting for quite a while , so they offered my friend a free upgrade and tried to move things along as fast as possible . he paid for the regular ferrari and got to drive the scuderia instead . i notice that they keep adding more and more cars to their garage ! how i wished they had a mclaren when i was there ! okay , okay . i 'll leave you all with a cheesy picture . here 's a photo of me in a ridiculous helmet but in a white lambo : http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/foh0yrn8xooic0kebvsj2q ? select=rmg_5rcf-rv8lfalwert0q # rmg_5rcf-rv8lfalwert0q priceless , eh ?
1	good nice grocery store with regular and organic food items . i enjoy getting the basics like milk yogurt fresh fruits when in season and some other items that may look good that i may wan na try . always good to try .
0	my group of 8 friends who came for a bachelorette party got reservations for pampas since it was a option i had through hilton honors . we got there and the service was beyond slow and the waiter will not be attentive . most of our group ordered a prix fix meal and it took over an hour and we still never got the food . asked what was going on and no response . told them that we were late for a show and needed the check . still never got our meal . so they comped our drinks , as compensation ! really ? ! ? ! ? we paid a voucher for $ 48 each to get meal and a show and they only comped $ 39 from the drinks we got . to top it off , 2 out of our group got sick instantly and throughout the day vomiting . still no compensation ? never go here , unless you want to wait over an hour for a simple plate of food where all the meat is flying by . get sick from only having the salad bar . and then not get any compensation .
1	this place had some damn amazing pizza . some of the best pizza i 've had in vegas , and pizza is all i eat when i 'm out there !
0	i 'd give this 3.5 stars . it 's everything you would expect in your run-of-the-mill mexican restaurant . free chips n salsa and a huge menu with all your classic combinations of the dame handful of ingredients . reasonably priced for the large portions you get and the quality is good . mostly , if you are craving solid mexican food this is a great , clean , comfortable option . nothing too fancy or high end . just solid mexican !
0	the selection here is solid . not too much variety compared to the other ones . however , this place has one thing that i love to eat ..... king crab legs . i swore that was all i ate here . the tri tip was pretty good as well . however , asides from those two selection , everything else is pretty mediocre . if you want king crab legs come here , if not then i recommend somewhere else .
0	this is your basic mall fast food chinese place . do n't expect anything more than that . that 's why it 's 3 stars . it 's good for what it is , but it 's pretty much what you 'd get at other panda locations . the thing that struck me about this little food court counter is what you ca n't see from the front . i used to work doing refrigeration and commercial appliance repair in the area . this particular panda location always had the cleanest and best maintained kitchen i 've seen in the cu area , and i 've been in a lot of them . color me impressed .
1	i ordered these boozy lush gems for our destination-elopement weddingmoon babymoon ummm ... any other trendy words i need to insert here ? anyway , ordered a dozen cupcakes sent straight to my hotel front desk . the process of payment and setting up delivery and flavor choices was done swiftly . everything went well , and as i paid over the phone , i had to power down my ubiquitous apple product as we were now taxiing down the tarmac . monday morning i receive an email . the cupcakes have arrived ! i was told to go grab them lest they melt in the punishing heat of vegas . so we hopped out of the pool and fetched these heavenly things before we were off to the spa at the venetian . i got marilyn monroe , an amazing banana flavor spiked with vodka ; better than sex , a raspberry white cake deal that was supposed to be spiked but did n't have even a moist center ; and bailey 's wet surprise .. the true winner here . dark wet chocolate cake injected with a sexy burn . the kind of boozy bite that warms the gullet . vegas perfect . this was good . unfortunately we could n't finish the raspberry-topped ones as mold quickly set in on those treats . there were only four of us so we ate them as quickly as possible however and did keep them in a fridge . they were amazingly delicious and so fun for my wedding `` cake . '' the price was a little crazy but that 's vegas . a dozen smaller cupcakes ( very light on the frosting ) in three flavors delivered to your hotel will cost you around $ 59 . gulp . but they were so dang yummy and welcome to `` come home to '' after a long night on the strip .
1	sure - it looks like its better days are behind it . but the work is great ! they care a lot and spend quite a bit of time getting it right . i am quite particular . everything gets wiped down . it 's the third time i 've been here . i 'll definitely be back .
1	my friend is a vegan and sometimes it can be quite difficult to find diverse menu choices for him when we go out . i stopped by zizi 's to pick up some dinner and actually had a difficult time finding it . it 's tucked away in the little shopping plaza right before you get to the walmart on n. tryon . once inside , there were actually so many vegan choices , it took a while to decide what to order ! this place is takeout only , but the wait for the food was 10 minutes tops . now that i have a menu , i will definitely order in advance . overall , the experience was very good , food was cooked fast and was quite tasty !
0	the pizza is decent , but delivery is an epic failure . put an order online at 6:50 pm . estimated delivery was 7:50 pm , which is long to begin with considering that wolfman is only 2 miles away from my address . at 8:00 pm called and was told the order went out the door . at 8:20 pm called and was told general manager was now delivering the pizza . at 8:50 pm ( 2 hours after ordering ) called again and found out the order was never pulled from online . bad process and bad employees who lied twice times . pizza maybe , technology no . do n't order from wolfman unless you are going to sit there or pick it up yourself . epic fail !
0	what is the number one rule of any great steakhouse ? get the temperature right ! nothing can ruin a very expensive meal faster than an incorrectly cooked steak . it just seems so demoralizing after waiting all day to get that juicy taste of medium rare goodness to then bite into a worn leather tough steak . both of our medium rare steaks came out this way . given that we had a show to catch and did n't want to have to wait longer than we already had , we did n't ask them to correct it ( which i am sure they would have ) . we decided to come here because the gf used to love going to the old closed-down location in town . the steak was always cooked perfectly with great flavor , the service was impeccable , and the experience wonderful . this location missed on all counts . i really did get the sense they were trying , but it just did n't work . and we really wanted it to work . the steak was very tough , it seemed maybe even more than just from the overcooking . the service was both slow and rushed over the course of the same meal . forking over this much cash for a meal that was in no way enjoyable for either of us was just painful , especially when you are treating your love to a meal that is supposed to be special . when we should have been celebrating our special occasion with joy , i found myself apologizing over and over again for surprising her with the new ruth 's chris ( she did n't know they had opened this location ) . we are really hoping that they just were n't on their game , and that they will get back on to par with the levels of the old location . but until we hear from multiple people that they have turned the corner and gotten everything running smoothly , sadly we wo n't be returning . there are just too many other great steak houses in town to hope they have improved after this experience .
0	sorry to do this , madtown pizza , but the last few pies have been less than great . i 'm sure many folks enjoy the copious amounts of toppings , but i 'm afraid the crust is n't one of those that cope well with the massive quantity of sauce , meat , and cheese . and as others have noted , the toppings are quite greasy . this may sit well with the late night , inebriated crowd , but ... you 're not open beyond 9pm , and my stomach ( and waistline ) could do without the greasy sheen . it 's hard to write this update because i do enjoy the staff and i want to see a local joint succeed . unfortunately , the results are what they are . ease-up a bit on the toppings , firm up the crusts , and cut back on the oiliness and we 'll be good . 2-stars is a bit low ; i 'd like to go 2.5 to 2.75 , but i ca n't go with 3 , especially based on the last pie from late april of 2014 .
0	ordered online at 12:29pm for a carry-out , but we did n't get our pizza until 1:25pm . apparently , they had to remake ours becolive screwed up the order - a simple olive and banana pepper pizza . on asking if there was anything they could do about our extended wait , they were unapologetic , and did n't offer anything to compensate . they seemed pretty understaffed on a college football game day . not worth the wait . we 'll go elsewhere for pizza in the future .
0	had lunch here last month and honestly , you have to judge it for what it is folks ! you 're in a casino in las vegas . obviously , it 's not going to be the most authentic spot on earth , and obviously , prices are going to be 3 times what they 'd be anywhere else . does it do the trick ? totally ! and is it still a lot more affordable than other vegas options ? totally ! i had the pho with white chicken meat and was more than happy with my option . my friend had a chicken dish and liked it as well . looking for something a little less pricey in mandalay , especially good comfort food , this will do the job .
0	let 's just say it 's cheap for good reason . walked in and the lobby floor was dirty , carpet in lobby hallway and other hallways had water spots and stains . i was concerned when i checked in , but glad to see the room was in a little better shape . the room was decent size and had a nice size desk with free wifi . the bathroom walls were redone , but the shower tile definitely needs to be replaced . it was separating and the grout was gross and black in places . i 'm not real familiar with the area and needed to be in this area for work . after driving around and seeing a group of teens mingling , drinking , and smoking out by the pool , i was kinda concerned . as a young female staying alone , i did n't exactly feel safe in the dark parking lot . to top it off there was a high pitched beeping that persisted for at least three hours . i called housekeeping and they sent someone out , but they were useless . i 'm supposed to be here two more nights , but will probably go some where else .
0	i came here for lunch and was n't very impressed . unless you 're already on your way in or out of vegas , i do n't think it 's worth the drive . there was just nothing that tasted particularly special . i did hear that dinner is better because you can take advantage of the alcohol and pretty much preparty while you have dinner .
0	why is it so hard for anyone here to see that this place is closed ? i brought up this issue a while ago and they still show it as open ; which is not . sadly , i went there once and it did n't really light up the world on fire . i wondered what happened to the greek place ? if they were the same owners as this place , maybe they should 've lived by the old addage `` if it ai n't broke , do n't try to fix it '' .
1	it 's like a tiny part of my years in japan , or a stolen post street japantown shopping area from san francisco ! a nice selection of fresh food , japanese sweets and cooking reagents , as well as various home products . did i mention the fresh buns and breads and sushi ? good !
1	found this place through my insurance and i really love it . i generally see one of 2 pa 's for my needs and they are bright and very nice . further , everything is clean and friendly . its not fancy , but they get the job done and i feel confident about the care i receive .
1	this is a beautiful hotel in the heart of old montreal , within a couple of blocks of saint-catherine shopping and the place des arts . i stayed here for one night on pleasure . it 's worth noting that i stayed with a living social coupon for $ 185/night plus tax , which is essentially 50 % off . i also know other travellers who have gotten a room for $ 200/night on priceline.com . i would not pay the $ 300- $ 350/night they ask on the website as full-price . that being said , they gave us a beautiful , larger corner room . there was n't much view ( other than the windows of adjacent buidlings ) , but the room was luxurious , with a nice , large washroom ( including separate standing shower and bathtub ) . service was excellent , and i have no complaints . while people seem to complain about the expensive wifi , i was able to use wifi for free while in my room . it switched to a pay-policy when in the lobby or restaurants . not sure why ... the hotel also has a fantastic restaurant ( osco ! ) , and a fun absinthe bar ( sarah b. ) . i would recommend this restaurant , assuming you can get a deal on the room price .
1	have i ever been to smashburger ? no . and now , i can say i have . so this place is neatly located in the stonecrest area full of restaurants and all your south side 5 second drive cravings . my brother advised me to make my own burger . and i took his advice and did just that . i ordered an egg artisan bun , aged swiss , tomato , lettuce , grilled onions , an egg , and mushrooms topped with spicy chipotle sauce . and of course some smash fries . how was it , you may ask ? well , this place is definitely place on my list to come back to . the burger was juicy , and with all the condiments loaded on there it came out pretty neat . i think i could 've had more out on it , but i did n't want to try my luck with a burger that topples over to the point where it is n't a burger anymore . my philosophy : it 's okay for mission burritos , no good for burgers on overloading condiments . this place was a quick meal with a good amount of seating . with a feel of old school dining mixed in with the new . pick up a menu , go to the counter , order , and sit down for your masterpiece ( or a default burger ) to come greet your burger cravings . overall , this place is worth looking into if you 're into burgers and a little freedom as far as creating what you want to taste . this place will be on my list if i 'm in town and looking for a burger .
1	excellent food and service . they were not that busy when we were there so we had a lot of attention from the wait staff . lobster mac and cheese was a definite home run .
0	i had not been to an applebee 's in over a year until tonight . my family lives out in queen creek and our options around there are very limited . we decided tonight on this applebee 's because it was fairly close and the wait was way to long at the native new yorker in queen creek . the food was okay . not bad but not great . the beer prices are great . the service was good . i had jalapeno lime shrimp with rice which had good flavor . my sister had lemon butter fettuccine alfredo with shrimp which she enjoyed . i had not been to an applebee 's in a long time prior to this because i had some really bad experiences at a location in chandler over a year ago . it seems as though they have changed the menu quite a bit . there are still some staple items that applebee 's has always had but definitely some added items as well . i would say that applebee 's is trying to do too much with this new menu . they have seafood , sandwiches , pasta , chicken , burgers and more it 's too much . they should try to do two or three things really good instead of trying to do too many things mediocre . but alas it is a chain . i would visit this location again . it was n't bad . i might just stick to beer and apps next time but we 'll see ...
1	good dogs at a good price . ed offers a nice variety too . i often walk around downtown but never made to the courthouse until this afternoon when i had to report for jury duty . oddly enough , i had read about ed somewhere before but this was the first i had been by his cart . today he was set up on the sw corner of jefferson & 1st ave. i 'm not sure if this is a regular spot or if he moves about the area but i 'll be on the lookout for him again so i can try a variety of his hot dogs . ed stocks faygo root beer in cans . that alone is worth a mention .
0	on a bien manger .... mais je m attender \u00e0 plus peut \u00eatre car on m en avez parler en bien c est bon le service et bien mais rien d extra : ) mais je recommande quand m\u00eame
1	paris is beautiful inside . the ceilings just take your breathe away . it always feels like daytime with all the clouds . the ambiance of paris is ... what can say ... european . it is paris after all . anyway , the hotel is an older hotel compared to some others on the strip . the rooms are nice and clean . nothing super fancy but definitely a step up from places like california , main street , ip and harrah 's . it is smaller than most casino 's though , but that does n't bother me at all . the best thing i like about this hotel is if you get a room with a view ... it 's gorgeous ! ! ! our last room , we could see the bellagio fountains . it was awesome ! you also get a good view of the eiffel tower , which is beautiful at night . you can also see the nice big pool . the crowd there is an older crowd so you do n't have all the young , drunk 21 year olds going crazy all over the place . the parking structure is shared with bally 's and the walk is pretty far compared to others . the shops there are kind of pricey but its fun to just walk around and window shop . the dealers there are pretty friendly , but we noticed that it takes a while for a cocktail waitress to come around . out of all the total rewards casino 's , for some reason i feel the safest at paris . i would gladly recommend staying at this hotel .
1	this place is great . the staff are friendly and helpful and the food is excellent . we shared the settebello pizza and the insalata grande . the pizza was awesome . i loved the sauce , and the pine nuts on it added a nice texture and flavor . the salad was good , but less interesting than the pizza . i 'd definitely go back next time i 'm in the area !
0	the starbucks inside the bookstore is own and operated by the bookstore and not by starbucks , so any of your starbucks gc will not be accepted there . that was a bummed thing to hear . overall , the bookstore is pretty clean , bathroom is very clean too , at least that 's what i saw when i visited them . location can be better as you ca n't see it from the main road .
1	love this place so much got to meet another great server today ! april left early for a meeting of some sort and we still got the best service by this great waitress named kaitlyn she informed this is not her normal location she 's just helping out today ! i think she should come here more often she would be a good addition to this wonderful good egg location .
0	i found this restaurant on yelp and was excited with such great reviews . we called and they were booked . we asked them to give us a call if they got a cancellation and they called with a 730 available time . they were very pleasant . we arrived and and had a drink at the bar were seated fairly promptly . restaurant had nice atmosphere . we began with the lobster deviled eggs . they were definately fresh good for deviled eggs but if lobster was n't in the name i would not have guessed there was lobster in the dish . i had the chopped salad and my husband had the dinner salad with balsalmic dressing . both were fresh , mine had good flavors . for our main course i had the lobster mac and cheese ( the appetizer left me wanting more lobster ) and my husband had the the hangar steak . mine was n't at all special not even great for mac and cheese and again minimal lobster and no significant lobster flavor . my husband really did n't like his steak and although small did n't finish the dish . really said the flavor was off . the waiter recognized my husband did n't enjoy the flavor and was very apologetic . although my husband would not have sent it back no one really came by to check if everything was ok until it would have been too late anyway . the waiter did comp the dessert because of my husbands dislike of his dish and was very eagar to make it right . my husband ordered the molten lava cake and this was really dry without any real `` molten '' center . i do n't like to write bad review but this restaurant is way over rated in my opinion . the staff was very pleasant but they could not make up for the poor flavors in the food . we will not return .
1	+500 points for the inspired genius of chandelier , a 3-4 story crystal-draped bar which forms the centerpiece of the main casino complex . unprecedented masterpiece of extravagant design in the same league as classic las vegas magnificence like the original stardust neon sign ( which , in one of its later forms was salvaged from the demolition , and still exists somewhere in the neon museum ) . you would think the vast sparkling draperies must be plastic , for weight and safety reasons . but touch them -- they 're solid glass . +300 points for green felt gaming tables - only paris , cosmo , and caesar 's have them as far as i know -- everywhere else they 're beige , brown , purple , maroon ... ugh . -200 points for the pervasive , inescapable stench of cigarette and cigar smoke and the presence , at each crowded table , of at least one heavy smoker . +100 points for soft , padded walls in the halls .
0	we have brought our jeep to be serviced here for the past 6 years . last week we brought it in for a simple oil leak . they call back notifying us that the computer fried . when we went to pay our bill for the oil leak , they had tacked on about a thousand dollars for the computer they broke and tried to charge us . we were very upset and was unable to talk to a manager till they next day who claims that they would give us a discount rate but would n't pay for the computer that they broke !
0	again , this is one of those chains where you ca n't judge a book by its cover ! if you have the time you can find some really great deals here ! they have pretty much everything here , clothes , paintings and plenty of home decor . when i visited they were changing over some departments it looks like they are going to have a larger selection of rugs and portraits and paintings which will be great or anyone who is looking to update their home . i enjoyed the visit and would return ! just remember when you go be prepared to search for your good deals !
0	last winter i was in between gyms so thought i 'd check capital out . it was n't too out of the way , had it 's own parking , and they had a deal going for a cheap 2 month membership . i did not renew that membership . the good : even though they are downtown , they do have parking . it 's free early in the morning and later at night . since i tended to go in the morning around 530-6am , it was nice to have a free covered space to park . in the mornings when i went there were always plenty of cardio machines available . the downstairs weight lifting area had plenty of weights , squat rack , and even some nice heavier kettlebell pairs to use . and you got to check out the shoes of morning commuters walking past the windows . most classes are included in your membership . i tried several different ones . the most interesting was the trek class which was a guided running ( or walking if needed ) workout on treadmills . it definitely made indoor winter running easier . the bad : they frequently have online specials on their website , but the front desk staff seemed pretty clueless about them . no one gave me a tour or explained how anything was set up . i had to wander around myself to find stuff . the gym is spread over 4 floors , so it can be a bit confusing . no one explained how their class systems work . you have to get a pass for the yoga from the front desk , sign up , and then give the pass to the instructor . i had no clue about any of this and the desk workers and class instructors did nothing to help an unfamiliar face figure things out . they cancel classes quite frequently . i 've liked them on facebook and nearly daily there is some notice about upcoming classes being cancelled . sometimes the notification is on the day of which would suck if you were planning on attending that class in a hour . once i had figured the yoga classes out , i took a couple of them and they went ok. i 'm not great at yoga ( tightest hamstrings and glutes in the world ? this girl ) , but i have taken many classes before at different gyms and yoga studies . i did n't go to any advanced classes here , but only those labeled as good for beginners . they had one morning class that was supposed to be gentle , easy , wake up and be refreshed class . the first two times i took it , i felt great afterwards . no pretzel-like poses , just nice opening things up for the day . the third time i took the class there was a different teacher . i do n't recall what the guys name was , but i do n't think he read the description for the class he was teaching . it was much more intense flow with advanced poses . several of the students were n't able to even get into the poses , but he gave no alternatives at all . the longer the class went on , the more frustrated i got . when there are only 8 people in the class and 4 of them ca n't do something for the past 5 minutes of poses and are just standing there , maybe you should switch things up or give alternatives or something . as the class went on i became more and more frustrated . when you are planning on a relaxing morning and then have this thrown at you , it kinda ruins your morning . for the first time in my life , i rolled up my mat and left after about 40 min of the hour long class . i went to the weight room and lifted heavy weights to burn off my frustration . just thinking about that class is getting me annoyed right now . ugh .
1	another of my go-to places . service can be annoyingly spotty at times , but when it 's good , the place is worth it for the good stick- to -your ribs soups and monster-sized sandwiches . there is a soup/sandwich special before 4 pm and the cakes are the old fashioned home baked variety . one can relax , enjoy one 's food and soak in the laid back , hippie atmosphere ; no hurry or pressure to finish and leave . in summer if one is lucky to get a spot on the outside terrace , one can enjoy one 's meal al fresco .
0	it was ok ... nothing special . i ordered an italian sub , and it was served on a bun/roll ... not the italian bread that i 'm used to . i should have just gone to jimmy johns .
0	ok , so you bake the english muffins .. we get it , but are they really worth 10 bucks for 6 of them ? this is the theme of this arcadia joint . the prices for stuff at dinner are unreasonable . it is at least 14 bucks for a burger on a very limited menu after 5pm . the sandwiches at lunch seem tastier and are better priced , so why not serve them all day , plus you can not find a parking spot during the day either . they also own the fancy pizza place and some joint across the street as well . i ended up with a $ 3.25 gluten free chocolate chip cookie and it was big and gooey and had a bunch of nuts . not too bad for a cookie in that category . break the bank at dinner and watch all the lovely arcadia types wander into this family friendly domain .
1	the food is excellent . i had the chicken and waffles . the portions were huge ! two chicken breasts and four thick waffles the chicken was crispy and juicy . the waffles were tasty . crisp on the outside and cakey on the inside . if some people do n't like the waffles i think it 's because they do n't realize the waffles should be crispy and not spongy like most diner and frozen waffles are . also people that say the waffles are tough may not realize that there is a piece of thick cut bacon baked into the waffle . the maple reduction is good but i would have liked a little more . i did ask for additional syrup . i also sampled the chorizo jalepeno scramble . the eggs were fluffy and the chorizo was nice and spicy . the potatoes were well cooked and tasty . the biscuit was little dry and could have used some butter or jelly . the issue was with the service . our wait for table was only five minute but i can see how at peak hours it 's much longer . our server took our orders very quickly and brought us drinks right away , however , it took a while to get refills . it did take a while for our food to come out and when it did the scramble was brought out about five minutes before the two orders of chicken and waffles . i hope this was due to the busyness of the restaurant and the fact the food was clearly prepared fresh . it was worth the wait .
0	conflicted is how i feel about sauceman 's . i went there the other week to grab a quick dinner since i purchased a $ 12 groupon . i called in my order right as i was leaving work uptown and by the time i got there , it was ready . like that since anyone who has seen the size of my booty knows i like food . the first thing i noticed when i stepped out of my car was the interesting location -- -right at the corner of west blvd and south tryon street across from the bojangles . good thing i came down camden since making it into the parking lot from tryon street seems like an impossible task . the second thing that hit me was the smell of sweet stuff in the air -- was i in the parking lot of a krispy kreme ? ? i soon found out the smell was their sugar biscuits -- sugar and biscuits living in harmony together ? say it aint so ! but it be so and they were spectacular , more like little dough balls covered in sugar than biscuits though . i got in , grabbed my pizza and salad to go but got talked into a $ 1.50 domestic draft that they have on thursdays ( along with $ 2 glasses of wine ) , for i just ca n't pass up a deal like that . i got the white pizza which has a garlic/olive oil topping , provolone cheese and fresh sliced tomatoes . it was good but nothing memorable . i was hoping for a little more pizzazz or flavor to come with the pizza but when i got home and took a bite , i was underwhelmed . i added a ton of red pepper flakes and parsley to make it sparkle a little more and once i did , it was fabulous . likes : cheap prices for food and drinks , open seating area with lots of natural light and varied menu with both italian and bbq items and a friendly staff . dislikes : unfavorable parking situation and location , lack of flavor of the food the food was alright and a decent place to try but i do n't think i will be saying you need to run right to sauceman 's anytime soon .
1	lex was awesome . she was very accommodating for schedule and location . she was on-time and stayed until we were all pleased with the photos taken . having two kids ( 6/3 ) can be very challenging as parents and even more so for a photographer . lex spent a lot of personal time with them which made the pictures very natural looking . she had some great ideas for locations , outfits and type of poses that would show us off the `` best '' . why go to a big box store and get pictures taken from a 16 year-old with a few cheesy backgrounds ? and then they attempt to upgrade you for everything ? lex gives you one price and a few options to best suit your needs . at the end , you 're going to want all the pictures because you 'll look that good .
1	this place is great ! from the time you sit down and they bring out the wonton chips ( yum ! ) the environment is very homey and relaxed . the food is delicious . when we went we had the wonton soup , chef 's special shanghai pork , kung pao chicken , moo goo gai pan , and orange beef . all the dishes were wonderful . my family in particular was impressed with the shanghai pork , which we had ordered on a whim but ended up being one of our favorites . the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive , and made the experience fun . we will definitely be back !
0	perfect neighborhood joint to walk to for brunch . noisy . tight seating . often a wait . beware of deep fried doughnuts & beignets -- quite tasty if hot hot hot . ( nasty if not not not ! ) seems to have a constant brunch menu that does n't change much even if it is chalkboard based . frittatta , quiche , omelet , french toast , farmer 's egg platter , etc . most served with a decent portion of spring mix salad and burnt-grilled italian bread . satisfying and reasonably priced between $ 10- $ 12 per dish with additional sides ata $ 4- $ 6 . food is locally sourced . the polenta pepperanata has a tasty sauce that is heightened if the egg is cooked correctly , over easy or soft . but often egg dishes here are over-cooked . the risotto cakes are tasty . the italian hoagie seems to sell well , tastes of quality ingredients , but otherwise is just an italian hoagie .
0	ribs are good . but this place is waaaaaay overpriced . go to rolling smoke it 's better and cheaper
0	i was so excited when they opened since i love mediterranean and middle eastern food . and i live literary down the street . unfortunately me and my husband had a bad experience . the service is horrible , the cashier/hostess/waitress is the same lady who after taking your order and bringing your food , does not stop to offer more water or anything . the food was served pretty fast , around 10 minutes , but it seems like if it was cooked previously and heated in the microwave , the meat was very dry . they give a huge portion of rice and a small portion of meat . and that is not all , after checking my bank account , i found out they charged us 5 dlls more , i have the original receipt and our total after tax was $ 35.50 and they charged my credit card $ 42 . i guess the cashier/server was not happy with our 4 dlls cash tip that we left for the bad service , so decided to charge an extra 5 dlls on our credit card . check your debit/credit card , i am not joking !
0	more like stress zone . i came here for my 19th birthday with my girlfriend in october , we got facials and a 1 hr massage . cost well over 300 dollars . we paid by credit card and they called us 3 hours later telling us it did not go through and threatened to call the cops ! they probably thought i was dipping them ... i apologized and went back immediately . turns out they charged my card 2x ! ! i ended up getting my extra they took from me and no apology on their side . it 's a very old building and the blankets are like hospital blankets but older . i will never come back here . honestly , go to a four seasons hotel and it actually cost less with a steam room and a beautiful built building . i will never ever ever come back here . horrible experience for my birthday . plus , now that i think of it they should have given me a special cause it was my birthday the day i went . i would give it zero stars if i could .
1	i was in the restaurant last friday . it was wonderful . this is among the best places i have eaten in phoenix . i had the beef , almost a stew . it was very well prepared . my cousin raved about the gnocchi . my favorite thing about this place is the low key atmosphere . the wait staff is low key , attentive , but not overbearing . the house is charming and its a really comfortable place to sit and have a leisurely meal . i would have given the restaurant five stars but i question how it can charge $ 48 for a bottle of arizona wine . it was a pretty terrible bottle . i would have sent it back , but i wanted to give it a shot so ultimately it 's my fault for not saying anything to the waiter . our second bottle was a lovely california pinot noir . if you have n't been to quiessence add it to the top of your list .
0	ce n'est pas le meilleur tha\u00ef \u00e0 montr\u00e9al , mais \u00e7a d\u00e9panne tr\u00e8s bien quand vous \u00eates dans l'ouest du vieux-montr\u00e9al .
1	the place has so much stuff going on ! aquariums , goldfish , crazy ceilings , etc . but when it comes to hand pulled noodles they 're high in my charts . i had the chicken and mushroom sauced hand pulled noodle and it was so flavorful and the noodles were chewy and cooked to perfection . i loved everything about it , reminded me of korean jjajangmyun but more of a american gravy taste twist to it . my friends had the chicken soup noodle dish and i ca n't remember if that was the correct name but it was so good ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you 're hung over that is the ultimate soup ! ! ! just be ready for a nap afterwards !
0	i currently go to lvac but my dad goes to 24 hour fitness . when he came to town he wanted to take me to one . so we went to this one and were sad we did . first strike : they refused to let me as a guest try the gym without paying . seriously ten dollars . weird because i thought every gym had a 7 day pass to try the gym . nope . second strike : he told my dad he needed to sign the parent/guardian portion of my guest paper . i was like i 'm 28 and the reception guy said oh you look really young . seriously i do n't look like i 'm 16. he was also very rude about it . i wanted to say `` dude not only do i get paid a whole lot more than you but i have my flippin masters so suck it '' . third strike : i was trying to figure out out to watch the tv since there was n't a plug in on my machine . tried to find another employee to ask but no one was around . of 3 of there tvs were out anyway . oh and no fans ! ! ! ! ! my advice go to lvac this place was so unfriendly .
0	bar alba is undoubtedly one of the most attractive looking bars in the grassmarket . its sleek , striking aesthetic is a step away from the traditional , broody look of the other boozers in this area . it steers away from the cosy tavern appeal , opting for flashy style instead . it certainly looks gorgeous and very upmarket , but i am unsure of exactly what atmosphere it exudes . we might 've just been there on a quiet night but there were n't that many people in the bar which was a bit awkward . i liked the low lighting and it looked very swanky but i felt sorry for the barmaid who must 've been getting really bored without people to serve ! it 's pricier than some pubs in edinburgh , but due to its location i 'm hardly surprised . it 's got the old town tax , but my friend who is from near edinburgh thought it was reasonable for booze so i ca n't complain . they had a lot of high end whiskys , including highland park which i would recommend . bar alba is nice but it did n't feel very alive despite the fact it was the middle of the fringe . there was something quite eerie about drinking in a deserted bar , so although the staff were very polite and the bar was lush , i ca n't award any more stars . i 'd be willing to give it a second shot since it 's a nice place to drink , but preferably on a night with more of a buzz .
1	first of all , i have to say my only reason for giving a 4-star rating is because i have n't been to many other authentic izakaya style restaurants in vegas so i do n't have many to compare it to . however , i 'm a huge fan of sushi and have had a few very authentic home-cooked japanese meals , and based on what i know from these experiences , kyara was a pleasant surprise ! it 's so unfortunate that it has gotten a few poor reviews so early because they really almost kept us from checking it out . the bottom line is , the food was great , the atmosphere was clean and comfortable , and the price-point is great ! do yourself a favor a give kyara a try . personally i ca n't wait to go back for more !
1	o-mazing ? quite possible . i think part of cirque du soleil 's * * wow * * factor is dependant on how frequent you see a cirque du soleil `` type '' show . the very first cds i saw touring in the nineties was frakken o-mazing ! back in the day , a $ 50 ticket went a long way towards entertainment . i like to think my personal support of the montreal touring troupe helped pave the way to the spectacle currently in vegas ( i also invented the man hug and originated the saying , `` play it by ear '' ) . i 've seen a few variations of the traveling cirque du soleil show , and the * * wow * * factor has diminished with each show . o-mazing becomes o-right to only o-kay . i 'm jaded to the quality of cds because of the expectation that they will outperform last year 's show . however , the core of cds is the same routine over and over : clowns , asian contortionists , trapeze artists and mood music . by the time the show dralion toured in their familiar blue & yellow tent , i thought the routine was bo-o-ring . however , `` o '' at the bellagio in vegas adds an interesting twist to the familiar routine . i do n't want to take anything away from the many skilled performers , musicians and costumes , but i think the star of `` o '' is the ebb and flow of the moving stage that can in seconds morph from an ethereal landscape to depths of danger and excitement . beneath the stage is a little vegas secret . the stage is powered by hundreds of dwarves shoulder atop shoulder . but do n't quote me on that . cirque du soleil tickets are a good gift to give to someone who has never seen the show . i think it 's also a good gift to give to yourself if you have n't been over-saturated with such theatrics . you can look for discounted tickets at showcase on the las vegas blvd near mgm . the only thing that i did n't like about `` o '' was ... * * spoiler * * ... the use of audience plants . a clown will pull an `` unsuspecting '' person from the audience ( read : plant ) for some onstage fun and then suddenly that person is whisked into the show and diving off 50 ft platforms ! hello liability . gim me a break ! health care may be free in canada , but no way does that stuff just happen in america . these french farts have used this foolery in a few cirque du soleil shows . the `` a '' in america does n't stand for absent minded . would i go back ? gon na play it by ear .
0	awful awful awful ! ! ! ! ! ! waitress was friendly and prompt , but after our order was put in it took over 30 min for the food to reach the table . i ordered pineapple upside down pancakes . i do n't know how you can mess up pancakes but they did . the pancakes were so bland and the pineapple was sour . terrible ! the country fried steak and gravy was good though . between the wait and the awful pancake experience turned me off . i 'll go elsewhere .
0	just no . i came with a group of girls for a bachelorette party and the rooms were fine ( clean ) when we arrived but we had so many customer services issues it almost ruined the whole bachelorette weekend . there was little guidance driving into the hotel as far where we were supposed to park and drop off our luggage . they ended up telling us it would take 3-4 hours to bring our luggage from the valet but we had all the bachelorette decorations , games and outfits in our luggage ! we had to go down and grab all our stuff ourselves . they brought us one tiny blanket and pillow after calling twice and asking for 4 pillows and 4 blankets - our room was half freezing and half hot ! at check in the girl helping us messed something up and we had to come down multiple times to have our card recharged , then declined , then reimbursed , it was so crazy and no one was being accountable . overall i hate the signature and i only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least the rooms were clean and we had fun that weekend . also , the sinks were making creepy water and gurgling noises all night - not cute .
0	this is a pretty small dog park , with only one area for all dogs backed up next to a baseball field . my husband and i used to go to this dog park all the time when he lived over there , but now i only go occasionally when i choose to bring my pup to work and we both need a break for lunch . the people have always been nice , but the grounds have not always been kept up . i understand that it 's a dog park and it will get messed up from time-to-time , especially in the summer , but a little upkeep would be nice . they recently `` remodeled '' it , but i do n't see much difference , besides them reseeding the grass and taking out grass in half of the area . not sure why they would take out the grass , as now it is dirt/mud/sand , and your pups are sure to need a bath once you leave . i will come back to this park because it is the closest one to my work , but other than that there is really no other reason for us to come here . we have driven past this park to go to chaparral dog park because it is much nicer , although we would prefer to come to this one because of proximity . oh well !
1	never would i have thought of doing this ... but my wife convinced me that it would be a decadent treat ... and a great bargain .... and that it was . we enjoyed the 24 hour pass .. starting with a late dinner at the paris .. it was good , a huge line up till they closed it ... and the next day we had lunch at planet hollywood .. it was so good we had to go back for dinner ... clean , well managed , and freshly prepared . i strongly recommend the buffet at ph . its all about not pigging out .... and not eating a taste of everything .. lol ... hey its hard to get a salmon caesar salad in vegas for less than 30 bucks .. so $ 50 . for 24 hours of pretty much whatever food you want is great ... not something i would want to do often .. but once in a blue moon why not ? enjoy
0	i thought it was over-hyped for what i spent and received service wise . i was overall very disappointed . i went there to celebrate my bf 's birthday and told the hostess it was his birthday , then told the waitress , and even told the water guy .... and my bf still did not receive the birthday dessert . : ( i ordered sweet potato tempura and a king crab california roll and could not believe how dry the rice was . i get a better california roll at my local place back home for a quarter of the price . when we finished eating , it took them 30 mins to bring us the check ! ? i was so annoyed at this point . i always tip , but in this instance i did not . i did explain on the receipt why i did n't tip too . for how much hype this place gets i am sad to say i was not impressed .
1	my first few vegas trips , i was n't able to go clubbing but dreamed of the day i could go to tao . now that i 've been ... it does n't disappoint . the dj is good , there 's a step and repeat out front to take photos with and there 's spots to smoke inside conveniently . full disclosure : i went in as vip so i ca n't really attest to the wait . i 'm pretty impatient so i could n't spend hours in line with girlfriends just to go here . but if you want the fun vegas clubbing experience , this is an excellent place to go . also love the naked girls sitting in rose petal baths near the entrance . i really do n't have anything clever to add to that , except that i could n't keep my eyes off them as i was leaving at the end of the night . perfect ending to a fun time at tao .
0	the good : a great place to kill an afternoon or evening . great place to buy used books and music . they also have stuff for gamers . the bad : its in mesa . the nasty part . tweekers trying to sell stolen stuff . so just know its a rough crowd . trade : they take a fair amount of stuff i bring in . make sure stuff is in good to very good condition . store credit they offer is fair . the cash payout for stuff is not . always take the credit . also realize that religious books are very common so do n't get mad when they do n't take all of your stuff . books : this is there strongest point . they really have everything . i mean everything . i also love that everything in the store is used . music : is way over priced ! the vinyl prices are so high . the condition of the lps is scratched . however i 've scored some treasures using my credit form trades . in light of that its still worth looking if you 've traded with them .
1	i arrived to a nearly empty restaurant with my sister and father . we were delighted with our service and especially delighted with the food . this place should become very bust ! ! !
1	what a great company ! the office staff was friendly and helpful . i believe the girls name was nicole that i spoke to . she was polite and got me on the schedule right away . even when i had to reschedule at the last minute , thom ( the owner ) was accomodating to my needs . i do n't remember the technician 's name that came to my home , but he explained everything to me as he was performing the work . he answered all my questions . i was also pleased with the pricing ... they did n't have a trip charge like the other electricians i checked out . tap and sons is an all-around fantastic company that i will be using exclusively from here on out for all my electrical needs ! !
0	we arrived around 5pm on their first saturday night . bar was full but there were some open spots along the high tops along the windows . the beer list was amazing and , props for using correct glassware for each beer . the reason for the 3 stars was the food . we started out with the chicken wings . i always use these as a barometer for a place that calls itself an ale house . they were served hot , but dry . three accompanying sauces were served ( ranch ? /some sort of light cinnamon flavored/ and a tabasco-like spicy one ) . unfortunately all 3 sauces failed . please do n't try and re invent the wheel and do n't try and fancy-up wings . would never order these again . we then split the roasted beet and arugula salad . the roasted beets were fabulous and just the right amount of crumbles . we did not particularly care for the metal plate the salad was served on , as both of us kept getting that metal on metal scrapping feeling when we dug into it . the service was friendly and prompt , our waitress was helpful , although had no idea what we were talking about when we asked about sour ales . i asked because an article had mentioned that it was a favorite of one of the owners . we would go back for a few beers , maybe try something else small off the menu , but at this point i would be hesitant to order a full meal or bring a bunch of people in to eat .
1	sensi was a refreshing change from the lights , activity , and general overstimulation of vegas . the entry features a refreshing waterfall in the background , cozy yet intimate dining with succulents on each table , and an open kitchen allowing one to view the chefs rolling dough for fresh naan . which leads me to the naan- it was delicious ! crisp , soft , and nicely charred with a flavourful dipping sauce . the waiter was attentive and accommodating . i am a vegetarian and my sister , gluten intolerant , and he was more than willing to modify dishes if needed . a ordered a butternut squash gnocchi with pickled pear , brussels sprouts leaves , and a touch of parmesan . all of the vegetables complimented one another without being overpowering and the presentation was well thought out . overall , it was a relaxing evening and i would return for the atmosphere and fresh , flavourful dishes .
0	took my husband here before our show at the venetian . had high expectations , especially considering the expensive price for a vegas restaurant . i had the bone marrow ravioli which the waiter recommended . it had a funny taste to it and i did n't like it . maybe it 's an acquired taste ? moved on to my pasta . i ordered the black pasta , since the waiter said it is the same thing as squid ink pasta . i 've had the authentic thing in venice , italy and this was definitely not it ! for one it tasted like regular pasta . the one in venice had a slightly briny seafood taste to it which made it unique compared to regular pasta , and b & b 's did not . also , i could n't believe how salty and spicy the pasta was . is squid ink pasta supposed to leave a burning sensation in your mouth ? i do n't think i 'll be coming back here .
1	literally `` as good as it gets '' ! ! everything was top notch ! great beer selection ; i had a french kronenbourg , which i ca n't recall seeing in the us recently . we split the spinach dip ( on a recommendation from my other half 's friend ) -- amazing . i had the `` nice little house salad '' ( which , by the way , is not named after the french city of nice , rather the english adjective , which proved true ) -- extremely fresh , tasty and very generous with the goat and heirloom beets . enjoyed the best rib eye i 've ever consumed ! flawlessly prepared and 1000 % tasty ! i got a loaded baked potato for my side and i also ate my partner 's cole slaw , which was creamy and horeradishy and supremely delicious ! the ambiance ; amazing . the service ; flawless . the food ; divine ! it 's a tad pricey for a weekly dinner stop , but worth every single penny of it !
0	i have been in a few times , every time i wait forever for my food , and if i dare to order a coffee i am guaranteed a long wait and a luke warm drink , one time they actually forgot to put the coffee in my latte ! ! ! my food order has been wrong more times then is acceptable , the service it slow and the staff seems not to care about their customers , terrible business ! ! ! the only plus is they have good beer on tap and my husband likes that , but we will not be going back until the change so things .
0	today i notice a toyota prius ( white ) with california license plates ( plate number 6rrm802 ) illegally parked in the handicap parking space in front of this store -- it was the third time this week that the same car has been parked there . i went inside to inquire if they knew who owned the vehilce , and a very nice young man responded that it was the `` owner '' so he really could not say anything about the illegal parking . then a lady came from the back of the store and asked if i was the guy that was complaining about her parking . i indicated that i was , and she said she was not really parked there ( yet the vehicle was not running , and nobody was in the car -- i guess she has a different definition of parking ) . i asked her if she realized that she was in a handicap parking space and she acknowledged that she did know that , and did not really care . she then asked me if i felt better about myself and i indicated that i was fine , and asked if she felt good about herself parking in a handicap parking space -- she said she was fine with . people , we need to collectively do something about this . the owner of business intentionally parking in a disabled spot , and making no apologies for doing so , and to top it off she owns a business in arizona and does not have arizona plates on her vehicle ... i say we should all boycott this location of edible arrangements ... i am only giving one star , because yelp requires you to give at least one star .
0	i booked a rental through costco travel ..... the line was extremely long ( like waiting for a ride at six flags ) . if you prefer to use a debit card , they will slap $ 200 dollars more on hold in your account and run a credit check . i think that it 's the most ridiculous thing ever . i hate the fact that i did n't get to choose my car at their garage . a slip was given to me on where my rental is parked , and i had to get to it on my own ; without any personal interaction if i had any questions about the vehicle . i did n't like the ford fiesta they rented out to me . the breaks were making some sounds .... and ! ! ! it was cherry red . i did n't like a cherry red car . other companies gave you options and are more personal . some even pull the car up for you , and help you put your luggage in the trunk . i like to be treated like a princess . their insurance is also pretty expensive . i was shell shocked and for the very first time , i drove a rental without any form of insurance . thank goodness , the car was alright . my damage : $ 152 for a 6day rental . not bad .
1	easy airport to get in & out of , & convenient stores & restrooms all along . it would be nice if wifi was free .
1	one of the best beer selections in pittsburgh . they have pages and pages of bottles categorized by type but also listing descriptions , alc . content and brewery . the imperial ipa ( draft , great tap selection too ) i had was dorado from a brewery in san diego that i 've never seen offered here before . the bartender was really attentive and nice to talk to . you can buy six packs and get 20 % off of any 4 bottles or more that you take home . lots of seating but i really liked sitting at the bar due to ample space and clear sight lines to the fridge bottles ( labeled by country ) , taps and tvs . also has an open window in the front .
0	the great : the slaw was great ! sweet , probably had some mango and pineapple in it . if you do visit , do yourself a favor and get some slaw . yes even if you do n't like slaw . it 's that good . the salsa was really good with juicy canned tomatoes , fresh onions , lime juice , and cilantro . the chimi was good , maybe overloaded on beans and rice . but what made it good was the sour cream , lettuce , pico , and guacamole . the not so good : fish tacos were so-so and the menu said it came with the excellent slaw , but i had to ask the manager for it when he walked around and asked if everything was ok. i did n't like the black beans at all because they had some meat , maybe pork in them . wish they would specify that stuff on the menu . the secret to good margaritas is fresh lime juice , simple syrup , and tequila . they do n't know the secret . it was only sour mix and tequila . the downright terrible : slow poor service . thankfully the guy in the blue dress shirt , likely the manager made a round on us , and after waiting at the end of the meal , i walked to him and gave him my credit card and asked if he could ring us up . our waitress was slow to take our order and then disappeared . i saw the hostess cross hatch a 5 by her name as she seated us . apparently 5 tables was just too much for her . summary : they did offer and few unusual drinks and dishes . there is some potential here , but it 's not even in the same galaxy as cantina 1511 , for example . perhaps i will revise the star rating after my next visit . i at least know what to avoid next time .
1	great to have a new gas station next to my folks place . price is just right !
1	definitely my favorite ! it is so easy to come and go , there is never a real mess either . i like that their remodel is so handy for check outs , renewals , and returns . awesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request : )
1	a smooth club promoter named emmanuel approached us in the mall and dangled free champagne before us . now ... i am a champagne lush . i do n't like much else ... unless it involves fruit , ice , and well ... a sophisticated combination of baileys , guinness , and jamison - but i am all over ... yes all over - anything having to do with champagne . so after watching the incredible le reve - we made our way over to blush , with our vip bands , to get our bubbly on . i have to admit that i did n't have high expectations for the space , so blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions i had . there was plenty of room to move , good music , the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly ( and hot ... ) , the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated , and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area , some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table . it was our first night in las vegas , and with our fake eyelashes batting , our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs , and our bubbling champagne in hand - we could n't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night . for any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night , i could n't recommend blush more . unfortunately for guys , they do charge a 30 dollar cover , which blush , though chic and beautiful - is not worth . also , while you wo n't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd , one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was . when we were there , people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling . very few people , in fact no people were dancing , despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space . i personally loved the low-key vibe of blush , but if you 're looking for your destination vegas night spot full of of table top-dance moves - blush may be too timid for your liking .
0	yeah the food was 'ok ' , nothing too special but still good . i ordered a burrito enchilada style . i thought the sauce was really good , but the burrito itself was n't great . the burrito simply does n't have enough meat in it , or enough variety of fillers . i prefer something like the nacho burrito from baja fresh which has all sorts of good things in the burrito as well as enough meat . a lot of people seem to love this place b/c it 's always jam packed , but i do n't see why it 's considered so much better than anywhere else that sells the same types of food . service was pretty good , and despite the long line the wait is n't bad because the line moves quickly . the inside can get crowded though .
0	the restaurant was pretty much empty except for our family and another group . the salsa was good and the server was friendly and helpful . we had a variety of food : tacos , enchiladas and carne asada . unfortunately the food was bland and not very good . perhaps we caught the chef on a bad day .
0	i 've been there twice . the first time , the food was good and the service was great . the second time , the food was just ok , their best dish ( pork belly & grits ) was not available and the service was poor .
0	we came here for for a pool party on vegas on the rocks weekend . it was crazy busy . you could barely move . $ 20 cover to get in . they tables were very expensive to rent and had a very large minimum purchase which i know is to be expected ) . if you did not rent a table , there was no seating . they did not allow any outside drinks -- even closed bottled water -- you were searched and they were taken . pros : open bar ( free ) during certain hours limited menu offered dunk a chipndale free snacks ( popcorn , snow cones ) great dj cons : too crowded no where to sit no open tables very expensive small pool very small space
1	this location is conveniently located right on the las vegas strip so it was easy to find . they had a bunch of different pinkberry goodies for sale that i have n't seen at other locations like an iphone case and water bottles . cute stuff ! it was n't busy when i stopped by so i was in and out in no time flat . bonus that it 's walking distance from my hotel . i 'll probably be back again this week !
0	there 's only one thing worse than an air conditioning unit whose decibel level rivals the planes flying over the building : getting stuck in a 90-degree elevator with 6 other conference members after sitting through 10.5 hours of said conference . we were stuck at the third floor and no one knew what to do . one guy 's solution ? press every button to get the thing moving . another guy gets on his ipad and actually googles `` how to get out of a stuck elevator '' . step number one ? do n't press any buttons . fml . the conversation between me and the front desk ( via the elevator emergency phone ) went something like this : fd : crowne plaza , can i help you ? me : yes . 7 of us are stuck in your elevator . * five minutes later * me : do you have an eta ? fd : um , we called the elevator company and we 're waiting for a call back . * 10 minutes later , temperature rising , coworker confesses he is claustrophobic * me : what 's the eta ? fd : the elevator company has n't called us back . we 'll try to get someone to help you . me : great idea . * 15 minutes later * coworker : do you have a f * cking eta ? it 's f * cking hot in here ! ! ! ! fd : we 're working on it . coworker : well , try working a little harder ! 50 minutes in , we hear all sorts of banging and clanging . claustro is screaming , `` get us out of heeeeeeere ! ! ! '' and slowly going insane . someone outside helping us yells , `` i guess it 's getting pretty hot in there , huh ? '' fml . 55 minutes in , the fire department pries the door open . we run out , sweaty and angry . then 4 of our 7 hop on an elevator to finally get to their rooms ( ! ) . later , all 7 of us were locked out of our rooms because staff went in to drop off cards and bowls of `` sorry you suffered for an hour '' mixed nuts . wow . locked in an elevator , then locked out of our rooms . will we be back ? not likely .
0	i did n't try any of the chinese food , the tacos were tasty but overpriced in my book . i would n't come here again .
0	the chicken was fresh and very tasty first time there but greasy cant make it a habit
1	great place to come for a chill and tasty experience . the bartenders were awesome and spent time giving recommendations and letting us taste different rums and whiskies that were unusual for standard bar menu items . i got the tangerine trampoline first : this drink was so good . fresh and complex and strong . perfect . the next one was my favorite : the latin manhattan . this ginger spin on the classic is a must try and was so good we wrote down the recipe ingredients . if you need a break or want to grab a drink that will actually give you some bang for your buck , you should definitely stop by !
1	this is the best italian store here in az ! ! ! it is just like the ones back home in chicago . only difference is the one back in chicago that i used to go to ( i think it was gino 's in norridge ... ) also made calzones , arancinis , etc in their bakery section . all italian food , fresh made pasta . and the family there that run the place are awesome ! it 's been a while since i 've been there but robert is so helpful . and they recognize my mom ! ! ! ( after spending a couple hunge . ) their cannolis and italian cassata cake is amazing , as are the rest ! ! ! if they would make homemade arancinis and fresh calzones they would get 6 stars from me ! ! ! the sandwiches are pretty good , i 'm used to more crusty bread like back home . easy to spend more than you intended , but worth every penny ! !
0	my friend and i decided to give hhagg yet another chance and this trip was the deciding factor i will never eat there again . service was horrible , 1. waitress dragged her feet walking to the table , did n't even get greeted for at least 5 minutes , looked like she was still half asleep , did n't smile , noo customer service at all . 2. asked to start off with two waters , started to also ask for a bloody mary , she walked away before we could get the words out , even when we tried to grab her attention . ( fastest she moved all morning ) 3. when she finally returned with waters i asked what types of vodkas she had , she did n't know , my date literally got up and walked to the bar to check it out , because waiting for her would have taken to long . 3. i asked for extra olives in my blt bloody mary , was told no because there was no way to charge for it .... i did n't really think my request was to out of line but moving on . 4. received my bloody mary , asked for worchestire sauce , she replied , ooo i do n't know if i can get that .... again ... what ? ! ? ! ? 5. asked another server for worchestire sauce ... never came . 6. at one point the server said i 'm sorry i worked until 1 last night and then was rescheduled at 8 this am . and while i understand that this situation sucks , i did n't make the schedule , or come to a place of business to receive slow , bad service . ( she told all her tables this sob story ) 7. my food came out cold . at this point i knew my date was already at wits end so i decided not to say anything else . but it was n't even like sort of warm , it was cold . 8. when we mentioned our dissatisfaction to the manager he kind of seemed lost and confused . he did offer to comp two bloody mary 's ( which we later had to have removed from the bill because our waitress charged us for them ) 9. our waitress never even came by to check if everything came out well after our food was delivered . 10. i unfortunately did not get the food runners name . but he was the only part of this visit that was a positive experience , when he brought out the food he was happy energetic asked if we needed anything else , he also cleared our plates when we were finished . and i had asked him for the manager he actually came back to the table to tell me he notified the manager , and came back a second time to double check the manager came by . ( with no disrespect , he was the african american food runner for the morning shift on 11/16/2013 , he would make a great waiter ) again , this was the last time i would eat at hash house , worst dining experience by far .
1	always satisfying and never a let down ! everything we ordered was cooked to perfection . each steak was juicy and the seared tuna was excellent ! the atmosphere here is comfortable with traditional flare . a really nice place to spend any meal !
1	this place has the yummiest indian food i 've tried so far ( in sf/bay area & in phx ) . it 's all vegetarian , which is good , because it 's really hearty fare - you 'll walk out feeling overstuffed ! i usually get either the dosa special or the grill special , both of which are like a mini-buffet for one ( includes the main dishes , dessert , and for dinner , tea/coffee . ) the dosa special is exactly the same for lunch & dinner , so i usually get it for lunch , and the grill one is better for dinner ( a couple of extra sides compared to lunch . ) at lunch , sometimes the chutney bar is n't completely ready yet , but it 's always been stocked at dinner time . also , the focus is definitely on the food and not the decor or tableware . the one odd thing about this place is that the kitchen staff seems to speak in spanish ... i 'm assuming that the food is more authentic than not though since i 'm usually the only non-indian there at dinner time ...
0	we went here after hearing that they had happy hour specials . unfortunately , the happy hour is pretty disappointing .. the regular prices on the menu are high enough that when they offer specials .. well , that only means that you 're paying regular price . not at all a deal , if that 's what you are looking for . service was fine , if a little slow . it was friendly enough . the atmosphere is very nice and romantic , and very quiet , probably because of the time we came . not a place you would bring children , at least , if you have any respect for others . : p the food .. meh . it was n't really bad , but it was n't really very good either . for the prices they charge , it should be a lot better . i do n't think i 'll be returning to this one , even though it 's practically next door . there are better places for sushi . maybe their real specialty is the habachi ?
1	what a great tribute to the classic american musical theater ! incredible talent , amazing orchestra ( and full orchestra at that - no half pre-recorded or sequenced keyboards ) . the set is pretty amazing as well . my only ( minor ) beef was it was too short . only 70 minutes ? needs a couple more numbers to at least make it 80. i also agree with another yelper who mentioned steve 's voice over in the show . i would have rather had one of the 4 main performers come out and share that information . i know it 's covering costume changes and all that , but you 've spent all the money on a great live orchestra - have them play a little ditty or something to fill time . musicians love to ham it up ( well , strings usually do n't , but brass players do ) . since the show 's only been running for 2 weeks when i saw it , i 'm sure they are still tweaking the flow a little bit . if i hear they 've changed it up a little , i 'll definitely see it again next time i 'm in vegas .
0	the only reason why i give a 2 star is because the girl that took my order was very friendly and so helpful . great attitude . i think her name was christine . ( i could be wrong tho ) if it was n't for her . i would n't give any star ! i was half way thru my salad and notice that the chicken was raw in the middle . completely raw in the middle ! so i went to the lady in the counter that looked like a manger and showed it to her . she looked at me and said : `` wow , i hope you dont get sick ! '' and turned around and left me there . very disrespectful ! unprofessional and just plain wrong !
0	i got ripped off this morning by health first urgent care . i thought the point of using urgent care is to get care and avoid the long lines and wait times in er . i entered the facility feeling very sick . given four pages of forms and told it would be $ 90.00 for the visit because i had no insurance . i understand this and have no problem paying for services rendered . after collecting my fee , a nurse got a set of vitals then a blonde chickie came in to say they could do nothing and i needed to go to the hospital . i do n't know if she was a md or pa or np or the janitor . no name tag showing and she mumbled a first name so i do n't know who she was . my point is they got my money then said they could do nothing . that is wrong , wrong . going over to the hospital , i realized i did not want to do this over again at the hospital so i just drove home . i would rather die alone in the desert than put up with that bs again . it is so wrong to take advantage of your customers when they are in a weakened state of mind .
1	after staying at bellagio , the venetian , and other comparable 4-5 star hotels , the signature is now my home base for when i attend those pesky conventions -- ces being the most recent . basically , there are 3 towers , no casino floor , and all are linked to the mgm grand via walkway . inside the room , you 'll find a nice and comfortable ( not too soft or firm , just right ) bed , fridge , stove , microwave , plasma tv , jacuzzi tub , balcony ( optional but i always ask for this and strip view ) , and too much more to list . though the $ 15/day `` resort fee '' they tack on may sound unreasonable , you actually get free wi-fi as well as gym access . other resorts charge $ 12+ and $ 10+ for the same amenities respectively room rates range from $ 149 ( summer / off peak ) - $ 350+ ( conventions ) , so make sure you double check with the front desk for any special offers before putting in your reservation .
1	stopped in for a lrg hot sith and my daughter had a med iced mint mocha .. ahhh perfect compliment to a lovely all hallows eve ! our first time there but wont be the last . my daughter is in love with the art by locals artists ... her being a young artist daydreams of seeing her art on coffee house walls and in museums one day . awesome shop kudos for the awesome ( and superior ) alternative to starbucks the girls behind the bar were awesome and very friendly ! ! ! we will be back !
1	a big menu and most of the food is pretty solid . they brew their own beer on site , and my favorites are the stone of scone scotch ale and crop circle wheat . this is a good place to take a big group of people and is in a cool historic building . i highly recommend eating on the patio , it 's really nice .
0	i applaud tcby for reinventing themselves to keep up with the plethora of other frozen yogurt joints around this city . however -- i do n't think they are among the best of the best when it comes to the self-serving froyo world . in theory , they had it all ... clean spot , great toppings , flavors that sounded amazing , healthier options , etc . we tried a couple of the flavors and they just did n't live up to our expectations . they sounded amazing , ie , bananas foster , white chocolate mousse , toffee . but , they were a little bland , tasted chemically-induced and just did n't have that creamy goodness that other places ( ie sweet frog ) have . the plain vanilla was actually completely tasteless . the toppings were pretty good , a decent variety . the hot fudge was n't `` hot '' ... it was clumpy and just not very good . the peanut butter sauce was in a plastic bottle ( other places have it warmed up ) and it was very bland and so that was disappointing as well . overall consensus ... i would n't go out of my way to hit up tcby . they were good in their day and i appreciate the changes/updates they have made but i do n't think they hold a candle to others . it is a tough and competitive market so the product has to be on point to really make an impression ! they just fell a little flat for me .
0	shame on me for not reading the reviews first , as stated by other reviews its a long process , when we pulled up there were 2 cars ahead of me , after 15 min . we made it to the vacuum . now i went for the middle of the road $ 19.95 wash with the rain protection ( another 5 min for the wash ) . now they park my vehicle in the sun because the car port is full of vehicles and only 4 people to dry . by the time my vehicle is done it was worse off than when i started , now one big water spot and dirty rag wipe marks all over . for what it 's worth driving a little longer to the other car wash is so worth it , you leave with a clean vehicle . customer satisfaction is not this company 's goal .. moral of the story , read the reviews first and do n't go to superstar car wash
1	after craving chinese food and checking yelp for someplace close to home , we decided to try maxim since it has had such great reviews . and , like most of the time , my fellow yelpers were right on . maxim serves both vietnamese and chinese food . the majority of the menu is vietnamese , like pho and the vermicelli noodle dishes , and they have chinese food for lunch specials , like kung pao chicken . i got a bowl of the pho , which was big enough to swim in , and my girlfriend got one of the vermicelli noodle dishes , which could have fed us both , and we shared hot tea . our meals and drinks were $ 12 . the food was good , the service was great and the portions are huge ! we have at least another meals worth of leftovers . so if you like asian food and are looking for a good meal for a great price , check out maxim . you will be happy and full - pho yeah !
0	go to the real thing in la . but , if you do make it to this show , you 'll find the crowd fun , the host smarmy , the `` barker 's beauties '' disinterested , and the prizes a bit shabby . nonetheless , i enjoyed the $ 50 show , screamed my brains out over dinette sets , conair curlers , and plinko chips .
1	love this place . love it . love the view of princes street , the scots monument , waverley , the balmoral and the gardens . love the quotations engraved on the paving stones . love the artwork on the walls . love the blink-and-you'll-miss-it writer 's museum . love the way it cuts itself off from the city in the space of a half dozen steps . love the network of closes , and terraces that overhang and wind off it , reminding me of a hundred years ago . reminding me of labyrinth . love david bowie . love the inspiration . love the real taste of oldtown . love it .
1	small ? yes . worth going to ? hail yes . this is the only cool bar i went to in vegas . plus , my local friend comes there all the time for drinks and good music . so i trust her taste . the music is always good ( top 40- hiphop/reggae/reggaeton/etc ) , they 're playing a movie on their screens , comfy areas to sit and mingle with friends or strangers . not much dancing room , but it 's more like a lounge/bar . oh yeah ... no cover ! i love it .
0	0 stars . huge disappointment . father in law was always talking about wanting to try this place since couple months ago and was waiting for carmines to open . we dined here last weekend and our experience with both food and service was horrid ! our server never came back to ask if we needed anything else once our meals came out . our pasta dish was undercooked . the clam pasta tasted extremely bland and tasteless . the meat sauce was boring . it took 15 minutes and asking 3 different people before we got a basket of bread . my in laws were so fed up with the slow service and horrible food . what 's going on carmines ? ? ? we will not ever return .
0	the highlight of our visit here has to be the lengthy typed 'banned list ' on the wall . there is so much to say about this place , so let me start with the positives ... - the characters inside seem lovely , this is clearly their second home but they have such a lovely sense of community with they darts and dominoes club . - when joe and i walked in we did n't feel unwelcome despite the fact that we stuck out like a saw thumb . - the drinks are unbelievably cheap , \u00a31.70 for a vodka lime and soda . - although we did n't try any , they had a small food menu , rolls for 90p and a burger for about \u00a31.70 . however , there are many negatives ... - it was close to 100\u00b0c inside . - smelled like an old people 's home . - generally a bit manky . - it was like an old men 's social club , not somewhere a 26 year old female really fits in ! so overall , if you are an old man who wants to sit in the pub all day with some friends , then this is the place for you !
0	well . this was the 24 hours to stay in this hotel . at first i get room floor 14 it was smelly and noisy . than they transfer me to floor 3 , but it still smelly and noisy . than they transfer me to 20 floor that was only noisy . than i left this poor place to other hotel . and i feel great ! ! !
0	this location is very convienent for me and the owner of the store , an older lady is very friendly and helpful . today i went to this store and got what i wanted , when i got to the cashier line there was one customer and the cashier was talking . i had to wait for more than 10min and she did n't even bother to apologize she kept on talking in spanish as if i were n't there . i politely asked her if she could please assist me insted of sorry or i will be with you in a min . she started shouting and saying that she is with a customer and continued her conversation and when she was done she started assisting another guest who was asking her about a eyeliner . at this time i was so frustrated i asked her to call me the manager . the manager came apologized and told me she will help me she did n't even ask her why she did n't help me . in this economy its there lose because i will never go back again .
0	disappointed as i was told this was one of the best hot dogs ever . we got an all beef and white hot . not the worse hot dogs we 've had but not the best . they do however have really good onion rings !
0	for the past several times that i 've been coming to vegas and to the vons shopping center ( not certain of the name ) i 've noticed sababa . actually , i never knew it was called sababa since what really jumped out at me was the falafel + pita + soda deal for $ 6.95 . i 've always had a penchant for middle eastern food and kept hoping we 'd stop by one day since we always go to easy life , which is located in the same plaza . so during this past trip , i really had a hankering for something middle eastern and kept hounding my sister about it . we were supposed to go to zaytoon , a persian eatery/market but the name and location eluded me at the moment so we came here instead . i had entered the restaurant with the aforementioned deal on my mind but once i was inside and glanced upwards at the menu i had no idea what i wanted . the owner who is israeli and definitely loud and proud about his restaurant immediately asked if we 've been here before and we told him `` no '' . he then gave my sister and me a falafel ball topped with a dollop of houmos to try out exclaiming that it was the best in the world . i 've never particularly liked falafel since it 's a vegetarian item and i need my meat but i 'll admit it helped whet my appetite ! we ended up ordering the sababa special , which the establishment touts as the `` ultimate pu pu platter . '' for $ 17.95 , it came with falafel , houmos , kababs , pita bread , shawarma , and salad . it was alright and the portion seemed small at first , but i got full off it even though i had to share with my sister . we also ordered a four piece appetizer thing that came with some bourekas and other stuff . i would have liked the houmos to have been less salty and the shawarma to have been beef ( they do n't have lamb here ) rather than chicken . the service was also pretty good since the workers were pretty attentive . this place is like a hybrid of sorts since it 's not entirely fast food but it 's also not exactly a sit-down establishment either . you need to order at the counter but you have the option of paying upfront or after you finish eating and must pay at the counter regardless . they bring the food to you and they come to you to ask if you need drink refills but there are no designated servers .
0	decent , clean , food was good . i 've only been here twice now , but it 's good to know this joint is close to home should i just want to get out for a bit . went with a girlfriend on a friday night and it was quiet , but nice . no creepers bugging us . returned on a sunday after a funeral with a bunch of friends and we were able to all be seated together right away . took a long time for everyone to get their food , but i guess 15 people is a lot to cook for all at once !
0	i have been there a few times . the owner is a gilbert native and a very nice person . the food is of good quality , the atmosphere is great . it is best to visit here during the spring and early summer .
0	-friendly service , very attentive , slow to bring bill . -food was average , a bit on the extreme salty side . -prices were a bit high , but they offer evening dinner specials for $ 6.99 . -server talked us into ordering the wonton soup-large was $ 7.95 with skimpy portions ( a few wontons , sliced chicken , tough beef , 2-3 shrimp , half cup of cabbage ) and lots of bland broth . not worth the price . -restroom clean , but no soap in women 's restroom . -decor was very nice . -parking is very convenient . -next door to a barber shop .
0	i drove 22 minutes to arrive here at 630pm . their website says they are open everyday 10am-7pm . when i arrived , they were putting jewelry away and the door was locked . the lady frown at me when i tried to open the door the first time , unknowingly that there were already closed . i was confused and saw a tiny sign by the door that has different hours for different days of the week . that was a waste of my time amd will never return . get your website straight !
1	this hotel is nice , i got a decent price through aaa for three nights on easter weekend . the staff is very polite and responsive . required valet is a little annoying ; we needed to go to our car a couple of times which required an escort ( and of course a tip - sew me , i 'm being cheap , paying someone so i can go to my car ? ) . that guy was friendly however , when asking about our activities for the weekend we mentioned lv indoor skydiving . he said he knew someone who worked there and could get us a hook-up . we saw him the next day , he said the same thing . nothing came of it . i was n't looking for a hookup but trump employees should n't be spouting ( especially unsolicited ) nonsense if they are n't going to follow-up . we got a corner suite , nice view , lots of windows , love the double entry to reduce hallway noise , full but empty kitchen ( slightly useless ) . the bathroom is enormous which honestly seems completely pointless but loved the giant picture window over the bathtub was a great touch . loved the view , it was clean , well maintained , very comfortable bed . absolutely stupid ridiculous that the pool closes at 7pm . one block from the strip makes it not worth mentioning but everyone seems all uptight about it , they offer a free shuttle to the wynn and ceasars so why complain . i like seeing what different hotels have to offer . i 'm not sold on only returning to this one .
0	so i went here the other day with a friend for lunch . the food was .... strange . i do n't know if this place makes thai food from a different region than most others or what , but the menu was not what i expected and the food was not what i expected . the place had some 'chinese ' lunch specials .... which is weird in itself , and the main menu had thai food i guess . i ordered the chicken with pan fried noodles .... expecting like a crispy noodle . not the case . i do n't know why they call these pan fried noodles ... they 're just kind of greasy wide rice noodles that are like chow fun or something .... not at all what i expected . also , what i found really strange , was that a ) they do n't have you choose a spice level , so the food is n't spicy at all and b ) the food had green onions and cilantro and that 's it as far as vegetables go . every thai place i have ever been to uses lots of fresh vegetables , which is why it generally is better than chinese food . the noodles were fine , they had a decent taste , but i would n't want to go get them again . my friend really likes the curry here , so maybe that 's good and i should try it next time .... but honestly i did n't think this place was so great .... also , it was pricier than any other thai food place i 've been to , with most entrees costing around 10 $ .
0	overrated , expensive , crowded , nowhere to sit unless you reserve an expensive table . we were not on a vip list so we had to wait in line . the wait was okay and the bouncers informed us the cover would be $ 28 a person . when we tried to negotiate , they offered us $ 20 a person to get in . great start . yes , the club looks sleek and posh and the outdoor/indoor set up is nice . however , $ 15 for one shot seems a little excessive . and talk about crowded . the dance floor was a major cf . i could barely move let alone dance . and i felt like everywhere we were , people were constantly shoving past . the music was cool when we first got there ( pop and hip hop ) but starting moving more in the direction of dance / house , which we did not like as much .
0	oh zada janes ... i love the smell of the cafe .. the food .. and the huge white piece of cake in the glass cake holder on the bar .. the people that work at the place know that it gets busy .. and they are working to get you served and outta there . on a sunday , we were there right when zada 's opened .. and within 10 minutes tops the entire place was full ... take a glance at the menu , and decide what you want ... enjoy the scenery of hipsters ... and refill yer coffee mug a few times . i 've only been there for breakfast , but its been good every time . i recommend the french toast and juevos rancheros . char jar .
0	overrated hipster joint . looks cool but food just does n't cut it for the price . medium quality , tiny portions . no iced tea , which was a shock . the service was so-so . very loud inside , and hard to have a conversation . we wo n't be back . too bad , because i was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood .
0	so i 've been here twice . first time i got the truffle mushroom swiss and some smashfries . to go . it was alright . was n't overwhelmed - i was hungry and it hit the spot . next time i came with some coworkers . we were all excited because here was a new place pretty close to where we work and it could be high on our lunch rotation . but that idea came to a crashing halt when we got our food . this time i got the spinach , cucumber and goat cheese burger . i know . sounds pretty metrosexual but i was curious . i also got the haystack onions . well when i bit into the burger , i had to wonder if bessie , the cow i was biting into , had n't fallen in love with the salt lick and continously deep throated it for the rest of her days . dang burger was salty as heck . the haystack onions were too . i would have let it slide if it were just me . my coworkers , however , said the same thing . it took the three of us to finish the haystack onions because i could not have more than just a bit of that oversalted mess . service was pretty sucky too . the einstein that brought the first burger took away the number on the table so the next guy that brought the rest of the burgers only knew to stop at our table because we flagged him down . yeah yeah . the place is still `` new . '' so this is the moment - like in a game of hearts when somebody drops the queen of spades or some card with hearts on it - breaking hearts , as they say . i 'm dropping a turd in this circle jerk of a punchbowl with everybody dropping five stars all around . we ai n't coming back . sorry . smashburger apparently is n't for everyone .
0	avocados here are hands down the best in gilbert . granted , at $ 3 a piece , they sure better be , but non the less they are always perfection . the cashiers on the other hand , are not as appealing . it 's as if they are being held there against their will and taking it out on the customers . they need a customer service seminar to teach them it 's okay to be friendly . if the avocados were n't so good , i would never deal with those grumps again .
0	set the scene- party of 5 staying at the hotel for business more then half empty restaurant half to wait a half hour for a table that could accommodate us sat at ginormous table waiter comes by after we sit , of course we are not ready at this point , dont see her again for a whole 20 minutes order 2 bottles of wine , salads , entrees salad was good but certainly would not classify that dressing as caesar entrees - lets just say that not one person felt that they could not prepare their food better , at home pretty sure my mashed potatoes were powdered had a better meal the next night in the lobby bar
1	ever since i moved from hawaii i 'm always on the lookout for something similar to kuru kuru from back home ... therefore , i 'm always looking for something deliciously cheap and with hugemangous portions -- - yes , i said hugemangous ! my friend , who 's a sushi chef @ marssa , kept telling me that xtreme sushi by my house was his favorite spot and i kept thinking he must be crazy cuz it 's off strip and in a still developing area ; and i could n't believe a place near my house was that good ( let it be known that southern highlands is in dire need of foodie spots ) . i should 've listened to him a long time ago ... i 'm an idiot ! all-you-can-eat lunch special is at 12-3 and it 's under $ 20 ! ! ! i think dinner is around $ 24 , which is average . and it really is all you can eat ! like , everything on the menu ! ! ! ! ! ! e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. ( except sashimi ) but , there 's appetizers , specialty rolls , curry , soba , ramen ; i can go on & on & on ... and trust me , i tried eating on & on & on ... the pieces of unagi were hugemangous .. the same for the yellowtail = ) and the sushi tasted so fresh . it 's like they have the ocean in the backyard and they catch the stuff right before serving ! unbelievable . the specialty rolls were ahhhhh-maaaa-zing ! and you can order smaller portions with pieces of 4 so , you can samps more rolls . my favorites were the kayla and some unagi roll which was crisp on the inside and outside . after this lunch feast , i was done . spoiled ! i absolutely can not eat at any other spot than this ... even sushimon sucks in comparison . believe it . now , i tell all my friends , i do n't want to eat at another sushi spot if i know i can get all-you-can-eat ridiculously hugemangously yummy sushi here ! do yourself a favor and samps this place ! and if you 're eating lunch here , let me know , i 'll meet you . i am always looking for an excuse to eat up .... = )
0	fish was good , atmosphere stunk , service was incredibly slow , and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis . although my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty . then he completely forgot to let me order an entree . meanwhile it took 45 minutes to get my appetizer . the entree came pretty promptly thereafter though . overall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it .
0	really ! $ $ is so wrong . try $ $ $ $ . this is a hotel steak restaurant . new york strip steak was average and $ 49 . service was ok but inexperienced .
1	this place is always busy . worth the wait though . food is good and the portions are huge . you may want to consider sharing a meal . they have the best pizza in the area . i 'm from chicago and this is the closest i 've found so far .
0	food and prices are great . getting them when they are open or have time to take your order , not so great . might just be a coincidence but almost every time i try to order or stop by they are closed . they are always closed on mondays . i got that down now . but they are closed other random days too . i have been a few times and there is a sign on the door that they are closed . i call first now but half the time they do n't answer . you never know if they are closed or just busy . i called this weekend to order a breakfast burrito to pick up . i was on hold almost the whole drive there . so long , i thought he forgot about me . when he finally got back on he told me they had a rush and he could n't take my order , to call back later . really ? i want one breakfast burrito . you could have taken that before i was put on hold and the burrito would have been ready by now . how long would it take to write down the order , my name and number ? 30 secs ? i 'm sure i will try again at some point . but i am in no rush . they do n't deliver anymore even though their website and menu says they do .
0	granted your first impression of these high rise condos is most likely gon na be around the lines of `` ghetto '' but once you get past the exterior , you 'll find out real quick that the inside of the condos are built quite nicely . a friend of mine happens to own a 2 bedroom condo in the vt and once inside i was amazed at how spacious the condos were . my friend is photographer and requires an area where he can place large equipment and back drops . and the view on the outside patio ? for get about it , its fabulous ! dont get me wrong , the area is most defintiely not the best area , its crowded and there are alot of ghetto ass people around , but i think for the price he pays around $ 715 for a 2 br/2bath 1200+ square feet , its a great deal !
0	if i ever wanted to feel like i was in a movie i 'd rob a bank for the thrill or date a 15 year-old . every time i 've made a connection here i 've sprinted , shoved my way and slid feet first to the next gate ( terminal ) . whether i 'm on time , late or early . rieffendiculous ! who the hell is in charge of coordinating the connections ? i suspect someone is on colored time and it pisses me off . also , i 'd like to speak to the architect who designed this airport 'cause this cumulative time consumption is busting my balls . thanks shek s .
1	being the first grand opening weekend , i was surprised by how many people knew about this place even though they did n't advertise as much . i only found out because one of the girls in our group read it somewhere from usa today ( food section ) ! as we got there , the line was already rows and rows filled so we decided to suck it up and wait the 1.5-2hr wait . when we finally got in , we paid the hefty fee of ( 45 $ each ) and got seated . we quickly ordered our drinks and ran to the buffet lines to see this `` extensive '' menu . i could n't believe my eyes to see sooo much food available . i made my way towards the seafood area which had snow crab legs to shrimp cocktails and even oysters . after that , i wanted to get some surf & turf so i went to the red meat area which i got my brisket , sausages , prime rib , etc . i thought that would be the end until i saw another room around the corner that had italian , asian and even a noodle bar where the chef made fresh japanese ramen ( which is to die for and surprisingly very good for a buffet ) , pho , and udon . this new buffet is literally the land of gluttony and our table was no exception . this buffet did remind me a bit of the wicked spoon for their aesthetic designs of their dishes such as their fried chicken and waffle came in vintage baskets and pots . even after consuming all these savory dishes , we had to try their dessert menu ; there 's always room for dessert ! the dessert menu however was n't as extensive as i thought it would be but they had some delicious gelato selection . the one that stood out the most was their strawberry . it literally tasted like the strawberry gelato that i had in florence , italy ! it was that comparable . they also had macarons , crepes , assorted candies ( swedish fish ) , and tiny cake pops . my expectations for vegas buffet are not that high for 1 main reason : too much different food does n't equate to good refined food because there 's too many different options plus when you mass produce food , you skimp out on quality . but rest assured , this buffet offers quality . i 'm just hoping that the quality of the buffet was n't at its best just because it was the opening weekend . i hope this quality is here to stay ! another nice plus was that the president of caesar 's sat right behind our table making sure that the buffet was operational at good standards and even greeted our table and introduced himself and bought a round of drinks for us . now that 's service !
1	i have been here a few times and had a great experience every time . the food is wonderful ( creative , fancy yet totally edible ) , the ambiance is cozy , sophisticated and classy , and the service is spot on . the cheese plate is delicious and their happy hour is fantastic . it 's pricey , but if you 're looking for a classy date night or even a pretty location for lunch off mill ave , this is your place !
1	i have been here probably at least 4x over the past year . i have never had a bad experience yet . last night my aunt was in town visiting . she was staying on the strip at treasure island so we decided to grab some sushi at the palazzo . the otsunami appetizer of edamame , crispy green beans and green peppers is really good ! it was the first time i had sea bass skewers based on other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint ! for sushi we had bobo brazil roll with is kobe beef , the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the lima roll with spicy king crab mix . also if you want a good cocktail the samba juice is really good ! they have a busy bar area to have some drinks , a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant . the only downside if i had to give one is the rolls are relatively small for the price . however the quality is high ! i would recommend checking it out if you are in the area .
1	i had the great fortune to try the kaiseki meal here that requires ordering 3 days in advance . there are different price points for kaiseki but for $ 30 , i think we got everything and the kitchen sink so that is pretty solid . i appreciated very much how the restaurant and my friends rolled out the red carpet for me as i prepare to leave lv . the restaurant remembered me from my birthday and gave me the gift of yuzu kosho ( truly awesome ! ! ! ) - then the meal which had like 9 courses ! gosh , everything was so good - please see my pictures . we had the following courses : 1. seafood and vegetables with shrimp sauce 2. sashimi of salmon , yellowtail and yuba with kelp noodles 3. shio koji marinated fish with mushroom and tomato skewers 4. homemade tofu and soba noodles with condiments 5. grilled scallops with yuzu jelly accompanied by cucumber wrapped salad 6. tempura shrimp and vegetables 7. rice with seaweed and takana pickles 8. miso soup with tofu and wakame 9. yuzu sorbet it was very artfully presented , everything delicious , and very filling . this is a must-do for a special occasion , and the service is top-notch ! yuzu really can have it all !
1	service with a smile ! the young man at the front counter was such a delight and a cutie too . everything looked so good that we were there for a while trying to decide what we wanted . the young man answered all our questions and made quite a few suggests . he suggested the carrot cake slice and the red velvet cake slice , which was perfect . the carrot cake had so much fresh shredded carrots and moist and the red velvet was moist and not too sweet . the frosting on both was lite and just right on the sweetness . we also got the square almond bar , so lite and flaky and the almond taste really stands out . i also looked through their sample book of cake designs and it had some pretty creative cakes . i will stop by for sure on my next visit to las vegas .
0	lunch buffet on a weekday . handful of people . i think i 'm missing something , considering all the great reviews . the selection is impressive . but it 's all very mediocre stuff . i just do n't get it , i really just do n't ... the chili chicken was like general tso 's chicken ( with 'indian ' flavor ) . the chicken tikka was n't even fried , and the sauce was bland . the samosas were oily and bland . the garlic naan was dry . the chutneys were also just blah ( mint and coconut ) . same for the fish - bland , boring , no fish taste whatsoever . really , just like a chinese buffet , only `` indian-flavored . '' massive amounts of mediocre food . ( and do n't give me the price . i 've had dirt cheap indian/pakistani stuff that 's delicious . ) besides , 10 bucks for lunch is not cheap .
1	my new yoga spot . this is not fancy place as some other great ones i 've experience montreal , and yet i just love it . the teachers are by far the bests i 've met in a while , so it balances the fact that the studio is quite small and basic - there are no lockers , showers , or anything . it 's an in-and-out kinda place , but still , the classes are just amazing . there 's a great deal for new students , too . you get unlimited yoga 30 days for about 40 $ . you must try !
1	my husband and i were out and about with our two youngest when we happened upon this place . we decided to check it out . wow ! am i glad we did . i did the build your own bowl and had tofu , no carb option ( twice the veggies ) , with the green curry sauce . the tofu is organic non-gmo and everything i ordered was vegetarian . it was incredible ! fresh veggies , perfectly grilled tofu , and the sauce was spicy and flavorful . my husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad . he was very happy with the flavors . my son ( 22 months ) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles . the kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges . my son had the oranges . it also comes with a drink . my infant daughter passed on the food . ; - ) it 's a sit down/take out place . you order at a counter and they bring the food to you . the service is speedy and the prices are good . we were able to eat a delicious , healthy meal for about $ 20 for all of us . in a country where fast food has become a staple in many people 's diet , tokyo joe 's is a breath of fresh air . if you eat meat you 're covered . pescatarian ? they have fish . vegetarian ? no problem . i will definitely be back !
1	wooohooo ! heaven in my mouth ! best peruvian food i 've tasted . the food here is so flippin tasty ! my favorites are the lomo saltado and the ceviche . the rice is uh-may-zing ! i do n't like seafood at all ... but after tasting the ceviche here i am hooked ! i love , love , love this place ! it 's definately a must try . inka empire thank you for sharing this awesomeness with the world !
0	worst food , got sick on the gross egg dish , there was also hair in the food . too noisy and cold , will not go here again . had guests and they were disappointed also .
1	i just recently discovered thrift shopping . yes , i know , it 's as if i was living under the rock . anyhow , i think this is mu favorite thrift store . it is wide , has good selection and almost always some discount is going on . i usually buy small kitchen appliances ( why spend $ 80 on bread maker , when they have several great ones to choose from , all for $ 6 ) . clothes is hit and miss , as it is with any thrift store , but if you have time and nerves to stop by often , there are some really nice finds there .
1	amazing all the time ! everything is really freaking good and i 've tried half the empanadas on the menu . they are small so get 2 or 3. the gallo pinto brings me back to costa rica . the coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise . it has a trendy feel but still mom n pop . i like to think of it as a costa rican cornish pasty with way fewer hipsters , and no draft beer .
0	new place - just starting out . bartender was hilarious saturday night - let 's just say a bit forgetful - no harm no foul . they were having problems with the kegs and finally i had to order a bottled bear . got the classic cheeseburger - it was fine not bad for $ 4.50 . next time i want to try the chicago-style hot dog and see if it holds up . i am not sure if the man salad sounds like true genius or just gross ... it is a salad that comes with a burger patty on top and fries ! i guess i will also have to try that ..... really cool atmosphere and nice seating outside ... not sure if i would sit outside in this neighborhood but i am sure other diners will be braver than this one ...
0	cute store but so tiny plus they seem so overpriced for what they sell . i enjoy the display but after going in charming charlie its hard to be willing to overpay for similar items and purses etc .
1	this place has a very modern and trendy feel . oddly , it reminded me of the cafes in portland oregon . the persimmon infused vodka drinks were delicious , but definitely pricey . the bloody mary was tasty and garnished with a giant piece of bacon ! the fried chicken was tender and flavorful , perfect ! the jamaican curry chicken was awesome , the curry had a unique flavor and was n't too overwhelming . good drinks , great food , i will definitely go back -- and next time i am saving room for dessert !
0	terrible in every way , worse place i have eaten in recent memory and it is expensive . this must be a front to launder money because i do n't know how else they stay in business .
0	we ate at this restaurant two years ago . i thought it was one of the best cajun restaurants outside of louisiana . we returned tonight . what a mistake ! this is a poor excuse for a restaurant , much less cajun . service is slow ! ! ! food is tasteless or over seasoned . the soup was served lukewarm . we can not understand why the health department has n't shut this poor excuse for a restaurant down . do not bother to eat here ! it is a waste of money . to top it off wait service is auto tip for 6 !
0	the most overrated club out there . everything about tao was horrible . really . the one star is for getting in free , and the potential tao beach may have if the weather was warmer . oh , and because i dont ' think they offer the option of negative stars . other than that , the place was awful . first off , you have to climb three flights of stairs to get to tao beach ... come on , even older clubs like pure knew to install elevators ! and you had better hope that you do n't need the restroom all night , because tao beach itself does not have one . they make you walk over to the hotel pool areas that are closed off , almost a 15 minute walk in heels , 10 if you just take those damn shoes off . the music was kind of soft , but that was because it 's outdoors , so i think they should get a better sound system . so the weather was a little chilly so my friends and i went down to tao itself . again with the stairs . and they have people trying to climb up to tao beach , so it was crowded . they had to have a kind of cattle shuttling system to coordinate the traffic flow in the stairwells . it was annoying at best . the music indoors was better , but god is it crowded . the decor was n't all that great either , but there 's a bunch of girl on girl action in the corners with their models and naked ladies in rose-petaled bathtubs , so i guess that somewhat made up for the other decor ... lol . but it was wayyy overcrowded in there , u could not even get on any of the dance floors without running into people left and right , and it felt like being squeezed like sardines in a can . there was no way u could move without jabbing at people , or being jabbed at . that being said , one chick actually had the nerve to turn around and hit me in the back , call me a b * * * * , and demand to know why i pushed her ............... umm , i ca n't tell who 's pushing who in this environment ? i had been knocked into so many times , if i had ran over someone as a result , i probably would n't have known either . my friends and i could n't get out of that place fast enough .
0	it may not be the best asian food ever , but this pei wei is nice , convenient , and a welcome alternative to the burgers and fries or hotdogs offered in the rest of the airport . is it a little greasy and a bit too salty ? sure , but for $ 15 total , you 're not gon na get a gordon ramsay entree or sustainably raised free-range chicken with organic farm-fresh greens in an airport fine for what it is
0	i ca n't begin to explain the horrible treatment received here . office staff and doctors not trained to treat women with a history of sexual abuse , and apparently without a bit of common sense . i miss dr. brandon - she was the only good one here , but has unfortunately retired .
1	ah yes , here i am again writing about a chain restaurant . however , it ai n't bad . i am a texan . my bbq standards are high . i have not enjoyed any other bbq in town ( memphis is nasty ) and if i will say okay to this place once in a while , now you will know why ! * outdoor patio seating : this past friday we sat outside , in perfect weather , while the dave matthews cover band played over yonder . * mason jars : we are thirsty people . most restaurants wo n't leave water pitchers on your table , but lucille 's mason jar water glasses are big enough where pitchers are not necessary . * biscuits : i never really was a biscuit person growing up , but i sure like these sugary babies , and their refills . * enormous portions : eric r. and i came here prior to a day-long fast for a holiday . we needed to be full , and we sure were when we left . food coma-esque . * fairness : we ordered the new dinner for 2. it came with a half appetizer , half chicken , 2 different sets of 4 pork ribs , and a choice of additional meat , plus 2 sides , plus dessert ( yes , it sounds like death ) . well , most people know i do not eat pork . the waiter checked and said we could sub 1 beef rib for every 2 pork ribs . that was generous , as one beef rib is bigger than at least 3 pork ribs . it was a messy , gnawing , lipsmacking good time and required multiple warm wet towels . * warning : i am not a big dessert person . eric r. magically guessed of the options that i would want the peach pecan bread pudding in bourbon vanilla sauce . we could not eat more than half of it between the 2 of us . it was so sweet i am on the road to diabetes already .... but it was really , really good . * warning # 2 : last time i ordered a mint julep and i believe there was only bourbon and no simple syrup . that may be a good thing to some people .
0	was alright - nothing special ... chicken taco was blah , fish taco was eh , steak taco was good .
0	had a very difficult time getting into the hotel between the valet being full , registration very crowded with only a couple staff working the desk , slow service in the restaurant and lots of early morning noise from the housekeeping group in the hallways .
1	was here for dinner this past saturday night . it was great ! this is now quickly becoming my favorite local restaurant . the meatballs are amazing , but more so the flat breads are incredible espically the fig one . highly recommend , great atmosphere and service . now that the weather has cooled the outdoor space offers a new diamention ..... cant wait to return .
0	little darlings is 100 % nude , hence . no alcohol was served . it 's a little off the vegas strip but not hard to find . if you want an awesome vegas strip club experience , this is not the place . it was dingy and cheap looking . i felt kind of dirty stepping inside . the girls were not in their perfect form . some of them were old and out of shape ( to put it nicely ) . if that 's what i wanted to look at , i could have stayed home and looked in the mirror . we were club hopping so this was just another place for us to check out . we only stayed less than 1 hour and skipped to cheetah 's afterward . i would say to skip it totally .
1	beets & saba - excellent & good sized portion squash blossoms - filled with a minted ricotta - and divine ! an absolute must try ! canteloupe , arugula , parmigiano-reggiano & lonza ( cured pork loin * drool * ) - this was a perfectly balanced salad . sweet , salty , savory - with a lemon/olive oil dressing and salt/pepper . perfect and simple . another excellent meal - the staff , service and food never disappoint . i was immediately seated - and they get the food out here fast . it was lunchtime , too . if i was ever disappointed in something here , i 'd send it back and know that they 'd make it good . protip : ask for olive oil when your bread shows up . this is one of my favourite vegas places . highly recommended : )
0	used a coupon from living social went to garcias first the margarita was horrible then came the appetizer fried mini chimis they were ok at best finally here comes dinner the plate was so hot could n't touch it food was cold inside and out and tasted horrible last dessert looked ok ice cream was froze solid had to wait 20min to eat it . all and all i will never return to this restaurant will be surprised if its still open in 6 months .
0	it was kinda coo ... it would have been a little more fun if there were servers around to actually be dicks but they were running a pretty tight ship . they were being pretty rude . i was checking my work email on my phone ( i know lame but i still have responsibilities ) homie kept touching my screen to make me mess up . i got the point . i put the phone away . one thing i wish i would have known is that you can leave your bra at the bar . damn . i am all for fun but you do not leave a $ 40 victoria secret push up bra at no bar .... maybe the $ 8 target bra . the food was pretty good but i had to bounce out earl to catch my flight back home . it would be nice to go again and actually get to enjoy it .
0	super-cute , cozy vintage boutique - stumbled upon during first friday . like walking into the closet of a retro queen , butter toast has a little bit of everything . can find something for yourself and pick up a a few gift pieces . lot of care put into store layout/ambiance , very enjoyable to browse .
0	the best part of this place is the scavenger hunt to find it . the location is ridiculously obscure . the hotel does n't even have it listed on their website . the casino is 3 floors away , and unless you 're leaving marquee , you would n't have a reason to discover this pizza place . we found a random hallway with albums all along the wall , and i knew from reading yelp that this was the place . there was a bouncer right at the mouth of the hall , and i was half expecting them to say something , but they just nodded and said , `` enjoy the pizza . '' then things started going downhill . the pizza was over-priced ( $ 5 a slice for cheese ) and mediocre at best . i had even been drinking , and it was just a let-down to be honest . the pizza was not a lot of food , and the crust was flimsy and a bit over-worked to have a nice chew/mouth-feel . the toppings were typical of any hole-in-the-wall pizza place , and the slices waiting to be served harkened a less than stellar sbarro feeling . the place looked out of place in the otherwise impeccable cosmopolitan , and the drinks were served in red plastic solo cups . i 'm not in college anymore , and i 'm not at circus circus ... please just give it to me in the bottle , or better yet an actual glass . the line was n't too bad when we arrived . ( around 9:00pm ) but apparently it gets ape-shit when the clubs start to close down . if that was the case , i 'd definitely not wait in line for this . but the 10 minute line was n't that bad .... too bad the food was n't even worth it . in conclusion , i 'd say you 're better off spending your vegas money elsewhere . it 's a unique idea , with a bad product . i 'd highly recommend 800 degrees pizza in front of the monte carlo for a truly amazing pizza .
1	you 've got to eat here if you are down on your luck and need a cheap meal to pick you back up . we walked all the way down the strip just to eat here .
1	love the service and smiles everytime we visit this store !
0	worst service i have ever encountered . passive waiters and terrible manager . with 2 kids in tote , you would think we could have had faster service ! would never go back .
1	from the name , you 'd expect this tollcross restaurant to offer some kind of full-on greek `` cultural experience '' , where waiters speak with exaggerated accents , flamboyantly smash plates and generally play up to every national stereotype out there . however , to my slight relief , when i came here with some friends , i found the atmosphere considerably more restrained - in fact , we were the only people in the restaurant , probably because we were there early on a week night . fortunately the isolation did n't stop us from enjoying the perfectly cooked food . the menu contains no surprises , featuring typical greek dishes such as moussaka and pork souvlaki , but our meal proved there 's nothing wrong with keeping things traditional , as everything was excellent , especially the starters . what particularly stood out for me was the spanakopita ( feta and spiach pacrels ) , which had this amazing crispiness that is never there when i cook them myself . the service was also really good , as you 'd expect , given there was nobody else there ! from fiona h. 's review , i get the impression my big fat greek kitchen gets considerably more lively at weekends . perhaps that 's when they do all the plate smashing .
0	the place looks great . it was a nice atmosphere to chill and relax in . however , the service was the worst ive had in a very very long time . the hostess seated us on the outdoor section , took our first drink order , and set us up with our hookah which was awesome , but that was the end of it . we didnt get a waitress until i approached the hostess who originally seated us and asked us if we would be getting a waitress . at that point our drinks had been empty 20 minutes . the waitress then came over took our drink order and it took her another 15 minutes to get them to us . the next round of drinks i had to go to the bar myself to get because the waitress was too busy sitting down talking with some of the other staff . on top of the horrid service , the drinks were exceptionally watered down . all in all , the nice atmosphere is not enough to encourage me to go back .
1	food is amazing , but you do pay for it so bring your big credit card . wonderful service , beautiful restaurant and you ca n't get fish any more fresh than milos ! highly recommend the grilled octopus appetizer , i still dream about it .
0	group of 8 and had no desire to seat us ! ! did not want to let us split up i to 4 and 4. wanted to put us all on one check ! ! not toe room receptionist was pushing 50 in buttless chaps !
0	centennial toyota has been our go to spot for car shopping for years . my family got a total of four cars from them ( one lease ) and while the salespeople are usually polite and not very pushy , the price you get might not be great and the service for the few visits i personally had were pretty horrendous . my recent experience at toyota was less than pleasant though . it was a big waste of time . i convinced my girlfriend and her sister to check out centennial toyota simply because my history with them and naturally i expected a rather fantastic quote from them . i did my research and called several dealership as well as printed the true price paper from u.s news cars website , i even had a friend who sent me their receipt from henderson toyota for the exactly the same car . i started off by letting my gf test drive the car and then the scary negotiation begins . the salesperson was very polite but let me say my previous purchase and my loyalty played absolutely no part in the negotiation process . i was quoted $ 3000 more than the true car pricing gotten off of the cars website and about $ 3500 more than what our friend got at henderson . what bothers me the most is that the salesperson kept asking for my bottom line . it 's safe to say that he missed the point , he was playing the bargaining game with me and i just wanted a hassle-free experience . after we told him we will visit another dealership and my gf 's mom has to co-sign with her on the car even if we buy it right now , he looked dismayed and became obviously less excited about us . he somewhat hastily ended the conversation and gave us a not so great price written on the back of his business card and we left very unsatisfied . he never mentioned anything about the $ 25 test drive gift card btw even though i showed him the coupon that they sent us . the whole thing took almost two hours . we went straight to fletcher jones afterward , and guess what , we bought our car there the same day . their initial offer and the only offer for the same car beats the centennial quote by around $ 4000 and the recent graduate discount was $ 750 vs. $ 500 from centennial . yes , the cars were exactly the same with door protector being the only difference . we had no negotiation because we felt the price was great and all of us were surprised how easy it was . with signing and everything it took about 3 hours total . centennial later sent me an email after i told them my disappointment . the manager simply told me that i should 've just called them and that they will not be beaten by any body on price . that 's completely missing the point . if they offered me a good price and played no bargaining game with me in the first place , i would probably spent a little more to save the trouble . it 's safe to say my loyalty with this place is completely gone . will i go back to centennial toyota ? probably , since buying a car is all about playing these games . i am not sure if buying at fletcher jones can as easy as this one . but will i ever convince somebody to go to centennial simply because my so called `` loyalty '' , absolutely not . there is no loyalty , at least not with what happened to me .
1	had an absolute blast ! a great experience from start to finish . love the complimentary shuttle service . and when said shuttles are freaking humvees , roaring down the streets , you know you 're in for an unforgettable experience . the safety officers are all military veterans , all of them professional , all excellent . doug , my officer , was very patient and understanding with a `` gun newbie '' like me . the authentic surplus military vehicles on display on the premises were an added treat . the next time i 'm in vegas , i 'm definitely coming back .
0	racist racist racist . i came on a wednesday for pizza for the first time and the cook decided that it was okay to to start spewing racial slurs and making references thinking i would n't hear him . gross .
1	finally authentic sicilian food in phoenix . combine it with great service and it is a classic go to restaurant . if you have n't been to tomaso 's what are you waiting for !
1	i never knew vdara was a hotel but , i guess it 's more of a condo-tell ... all rooms were suites and my cousin was staying here for a business meeting . so , i got to samps the premises ! everything was what you 'd expect from a new hotel and one that is on city center property -- - modern ! flat screen tv , hot tub , stand-up showers , kitchen , mechanical shades . i just wish there was a flat screen in the bathroom when i took a hot tub : p lol thee best thing about the room were the aveda products * big grin * considering the building itself is far from other buildings and it does n't have a casino in it ; the hotel was really quite which is good when you 're in town for business ; and not for partying ( * gasp * i know , shocker ! ) . and because its away from other buildings , the pool was pretty nice , quiet , and , best of all , not crowded ! stay here ! and give the bathroom products to me : d
0	it was pretty cheap to fly to las vegas . depending on how many days you book ahead , you can save considerable monies . southwest has easy checkins . a long list of departure times and they leave from oaktown !
1	i ordered from the summer tasting menu at $ 39 and started with their summer gazpacho ... a cool , refreshing cherry tomato gazpacho with cucumber and chunks of burrata ( italian soft cheese ) . the kurobuta pork chop was the main , and was the highlight of my meal ... anytime a restaurant serves kurobuta ( japanese black pig ) and cooks it perfectly deserves at least 4 stars . it was tender and juicy greatness ... i could go on and on . the dessert was a peach crisp and rounded out the meal wonderfully . appetizers range from $ 8- $ 15 , and main dishes are $ 20- $ 40 . try to request a booth if you 're dining for 2 or 4 ... and let the servers know that you 'll be asking for the warm , grilled ciabatta bread w/rosemary olive oil to keep coming !
1	i hate everything about the palace station except the oyster bar . loved the pan roast . it was rich , tasty and spicy . it was chocked full of tender fresh seafood . just like louisiana ! ! ! loved the calamari also . could not even finish 1/4 of the huge serving . this place just seats just 20 people , so prepare for a long wait if you do not show up at an off time ( like 4pm on a weekday ) . its a great place for couples , but a trio or more might have a struggle finding a place to sit together . everyone is really social at the oyster bar , which added to my experience . will definately be back
0	high pressure sales tactics and an average product . it was funny to listen to the guy tell me how much better their solution was that my current one and then try to justify why it was going to cost almost twice as much for approximately 1/2 the channels . i think i will stick with dish .... however , i would use them over cox .
1	i was blown away by la reve -- steve winn 's version of cirque du soleil . it was nothing short of spectacular ! the water elements were truly amazing . i could n't believe the acrobatics , the heights , the dancing , the antics . i was also surprised by the depth of emotion i felt too . it was so abstract , yet so emo . i do wonder about the guy with the man boobs though ... can anyone enlighten me ? still contemplating that one .
1	food was very good ! great breakfast variety and lunch options as well . love the dog friendly patio ! amanda was a great waitress ! very friendly : ) i will definitely be coming back .
1	creative , fresh , tasty & here to stay ! i have had many items on the menu , breakfast and lunch , enjoyed it all .
0	if i could give it a 0 star rating , i would . the awful service sent us right back out instead of eating there . we arrived at 7:00 on a saturday evening , which i know is a busy time . all i wanted was to order a snack from the sushi bar . when we got there , 4 girls were up front in some kind of disarray . we stood there for a few minutes ; no one greeted us , told us they 'd be with us soon ... no acknowledgment at all . the sushi bar was practically empty , so we asked loudly if you could seat yourself . no one replied , so we started walking to the sushi bar . a girl then came running after us , not to greet us , but to rudely state that the bar was n't self seating and that there was a wait since the staff was behind . we then promptly walked out . i did call the manager , who was very apologetic , but i still wo n't go back .
1	this place was hard to find in the dark after a 5 day drive from texas . first off , what 's up with pittsburgh and ginger ale ? i 've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup , bottle or can in texas , but here it seems to be everywhere ! every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended i try their ginger ale and it 's really good ! so we all got that to drink . to start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili . a few friends told me `` do n't get the chili , you 're there for a sandwich . '' they were right . the chili was n't good . we do n't put beans in chili here , and it should be thick , meaty , and able to eat through a spoon . this stuff was weak , watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables . our chili would make people in pittsburgh fall over dead . i got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich , the wife had the philly , and the kids had corned beef and a ham . we had seen the hundreds of tv shows about this place and we were finally here to see if the mix of coleslaw , fries and meat was really as awesome as they say it is . they were right . the sandwiches did n't seem as big as they were on tv but they were freakin ' awesome . we all enjoyed these sandwiches more than any sandwich we had ever had before . we had just had a long day of eating tons of bacon and bacon booze , so i did n't think any of us would be able to finish a big sandwich . we did . it was soooo good . the only bad part about coming to pittsburgh and visiting primanti bros is that we had to go back home the next day !
0	one word : convenient ! went for a friend 's bday and the only thing we had on the agenda was to sit by the pool and go to the hottest clubs . we checked in at about 1pm friday since our room was ready . we had a room with two queen beds . the room was clean and service was great . i ordered towels and extra cups and they came right away . we knew we would n't be staying in our hotel for much of the day except to sleep , so why pay for a room that would n't be utilized ? late check out is at noon . we left on sunday . pool : there is a lazy river , wave pool , and regular pool . i do n't think this is a kid friendly hotel . the pool was conveniently located a couple of feet from the elevator which meant we did n't have to walk that far . it was hot ! there were more 21yo and up adults drinking and smoking , than families . food court : i love how convenient this hotel is . once you got out of the elevator it was only a couple feet away from the food court , which included mc donald 's , subway , sbarro , hagen daz , etc . sit down dining and buffets were also close together . i 'd stay here again based on price and how convenient everything was located in the hotel . i mean if you do n't plan on staying in your room and cabbing it everywhere , why pay more on a hotel room ?
0	really do n't like the concept of waiting in line to order . no greeter but the bartender tried to help . the cashier was too busy discussing how much money they made in tips to wait on us , but finally asked us what we wanted . then i do n't get a reciept and am told to go to table ? ? ? do n't talk to me or i 'll forget the number ! the chairs are sooo tall i almost have to jump to get on it .... the burger was under cooked - but better than overcooked . and the whole concept is too expensive if i have to wait in a line to order . just disapointed ....
0	i am wondering if we were just here on an off night because the reviews for this place are n't bad . i just ca n't give it any more stars . the service was horrible . we sat at the table for 10 minutes with out drinks . when we ordered , i got a sangria and water , and my husband a peach tea and water . first they brought the wrong tea , my sangria was correct , but no waters . i had to ask her twice before she brought them . she asked us if we wanted another basket of bisqiuts , we said yes ! well , we never received that second basket . we got the pound shrimp with potatoes and corn . the potatoes were ok , but the corn was soggy . when we were leaving , our waitress was texting on her phone . guess she was too busy doing that to serve our drinks . if you like slow service and no drinks , then i guess you would enjoy this place . i left my debit card there , and sadly had to come back . i went the next evening to get it , and it took almost ten minutes for the manager to come up . i sat there forever . they were not busy . they had to call back to the manager twice . i guess i should n't of expected it to be a fast trip considering our service the night before . we wo n't be returning .
0	looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends . it was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share . i got to try the sardines , cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria . i 'd like to go a second time , anyone wan na come with me ?
0	i had been wanting to check out the comedy zone for a while now and i finally came to see the beards of comedy on a weeknight . where i really dig the layout and format of the interior , there are just a few things that gave a lackluster feel . the fact that they do n't serve/allow tap water in a glass is just stupid . i 'm not really amped on ordering food , beer , and cocktails since we just paid for tickets and had dinner elsewhere , so paying for a $ 2 bottle of water ( really ? ? ) is n't high on my to-do list . not a big deal in the end , but it 's more of a hassle than not drinking anything at all throughout the show . the entrance is still kind of bizarre to me . they built that ramp down to the nearest exterior door but do n't utilize it as the main entrance . you still have to walk through the saloon , get dirty looks from the bar staff , and then walk down the stairs . meh . i 'm not too thrilled about it . at the end of the night , it 's a killer comedy club . hiccups are minor and do n't detract from the evening that is yet to be had . do n't sweat it . i 'm really looking forward to coming back for another show soon . more improve , please !
1	outstanding ! and i am not a fan of buffets , because i do not believe that anything good in quality can be produced using mess production ! bacchanal is different . went there out of curiosity . i find caesars dining options , with exception of hyakumi , excellent , so decided to check out bacchanal ! most of the dishes i tried can be easily compared to high end restaurants food on quality & taste . duck , lamb chops , roasted chicken .. the list can go on and on . seafood unfortunately was no different the anywhere else . frozen , tasteless and very poor quality . my biggest complain would be the layout of place . it is impossible to walk without bumping into somebody .. bad idea when you carry hot plates . over all great place . i just wish it would stay this way . unfortunately seeing what happen to wynn , bellagio , cosmopolitan , etc . i give them 2-3 months until cost cuts will take place .
1	dd , you have redeemed yourself ! after my first nightmare experience at dd , i decided to give it another shot . it was friday night , happy hour with a party of 8 , a recipe for disaster . i called ahead and was delighted to hear they accepted reservations . we were sat immediately upon arrival and greeted by our server shortly after . if you 've never been to dd , their happy hour is awesome and runs until 8pm . the hh menu has a little bit of everything including starters , entrees , salads , drinks , and burgers . i started off with the mushroom and brie fondue and a hibiscus margarita . both were excellent ; i just wish they served it with more dipping items . it came with a few small slices of pretzel and a couple veggies , so i ended up with a bunch of fondue and a spoon ! other starters ordered included a shrimp `` cocktail '' , pretzels and crab cakes . those who ate them seemed very pleased as they disappeared quickly . for dinner i went with the veggie burger . it was homemade and very tasty . unfortunately i had gorged myself in fondue so was unable to eat hardly any of it . a few other burgers were ordered at the table , some tacos , a huge salad ( which was on hh too ) and a couple orders of sliders . the sliders looked awesome ; they were much bigger than any other slider i have ever seen . my initial reaction was to upgrade my review to a 3 , but after further consideration i 've decided 4 stars is more appropriate considering the quality and price of the food .
0	in todays tight economy i really hate to speak ill of a restaurant unless they deserve it this place does not ... really .... but i was the only patron in the restaurant and had to get my own salt and pepper and i sat without a water refill as i ate my dinner untill i was almost finnished on the high note the baba ganoush was fair at a decent price the salad was quite good fresh and crisp and the kafta kabob was dry should have had some tazeki with it to help moisten the meat . the lady/waitperson/maybe owner was nice enough but not overly intrested in making sure i had what i needed as i ate my dinner 3 stars is kinda pushin it ....... the real question is would i go back ? ? ? ? ? we 'll see they did have some lunch specials 11am 3pm
0	currently at fastmed . it 's been close to two hours and still no doctor or pa or whoever to see me . only 3 people when i got here in waiting room . definitely would not recommend this place . too sssssllllloooowwww !
1	i love lolo 's chicken & waffles just as much as the next sheep but off da hook soul food is where its at ... now . there 's a new place that popped up on glendale just east of 19th ave which is a must go . all soul food ... all the time ... 7 days a week in fact . get there asap .. for a soul food experience you just might like more than lolo 's .. im just keeping it real because i think i rushed to this place because although lolo 's was my go-to spot , it was starting to become my have-to spot who occasionally gave me soggy waffles and fried chicken someone dropped the salt shaker in that day . note . i did not get to try the mac & cheese at off da hook so that lolo 's still holds my top macaroni and cheese spot . ok fried chicken wings : moist , crispy , not greasy ( seriously , it was all crispy grease-free skin , weird but very pleasant ) , less salt-mo pepper seasoning which is what i meant by this is a whole notha chicken compared to what i am used to ... but i am freakin in love with it fries : good and with the all necessary seasoned salt corn bread : bread , not a muffin , but i can live with that as long as i can slather hot sauce or honey on it i 'm good waffle : extra brown , extra crispy , moist on the inside , and served with a modest amount ( not a half cup ) of whipped butter and some thick a * * syrup in that pretty little glass syrup bottle . best waffle ive ever had . i always felt something missing from all the waffles ive done before , but now i know the lasting brown crisp was what i have been missing because something needs to stand up to syrup . do n't anyone come after me saying their waffle was burnt because just wait till your syrup lays all over that and you will know what it is i 'm talking bout . kool-aid : kick you in the pants sweet , but with all that ice it all smooths out price : average soul food prices $ 7.00 - $ 9.00 a plate $ 1.00 - $ 4.00 per side great basket specials like 8 wings & fries for $ 10 , or 2 wings & fries for $ 4 i think ? atmosphere : typical , but lotsa people for only being a week , and it was nice to bask in a restaurant stinking with the sweet spice smell of homemade sweet potato pie . service : great service , waiter repeats all you ordered back to you , got my drinks to me within 5 minutes , food within 20 more minutes and totally-totally made up for the macaroni and cheese shortage . 4 stars for now ... i wanted to do 5 but i did n't get to try more since my tummy can only handle so much goodness on one friday night . you will love it as an incredible change from the typical have-to spot .
0	i really wish yelp would allow zero stars . since airpark dodge is local we figured it would be a great place to go purchase our exact specification of a jeep grand cherokee for exactly the cost we investigated as fair . we attempted to make this purchase at airpark dodge using our own funding . this process will include working out the deal over the phone .... the below story can be summed up with airpark 's final statement to me as `` ... if you do not finance through us we do n't want your business and we want you to leave '' in any case , airpark dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience i have ever had . they are , in my opinion , the most extremely aggressive , misleading , non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership i have ever run across . they wasted a full day of my time and i suggest , prior to going , you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * during the entire 24 hour process ( to the hour ) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate ( one they would either not beat or could barely match ) . in any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required . it was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction . we started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone . all we needed was the purchase agreement from them . and we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase . without going into the line by line issues i will simply state a full day of `` misunderstandings '' on totals , rebates , sums , flaws and missteps occurred . they continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank . not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork . it was extremely clear as to what we were looking for . i find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner . it became obvious i would have to go and get it from them physically ( which ends out being exactly what they wanted ) . upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit ( of which i , again , clearly stated i wanted no part of ) . in fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information ( this included my ssn ) .... i may be dense but not that dense and i clarified my position by statingif i gave you my ssn you do not have permission to run my credit .... funny , he no longer cared to get that filled out and ran off to see his manager ( and i had no intention of giving this to him anyhow ) the finance manager got into the mix , actually had the nerve to ask me to explain what the problem was . after spending the last day working on this i was not about to describe the events of the day . this particular question was a bit misleading as shortly after he talked as though he was fully versed in the situation . i am pretty sure he was not fully versed in my particular situation , i sincerely believe he was versed in the script written for our particular purchasing requirement . well as we know they said they do n't want our business if we are not going to finance through them . they also mentioned we will receive a negative review anyhow .... guess they did n't think of yelp . i know i should have left sooner but was stuck on the good price i worked out ...... really should have left sooner . .... and the rest of the story .... the next day we went to chapman dodge .... the acquired the exact same ( physically the same ) vehicle and sold it to us for exactly our asking price . the purchase experience was exactly what i hoped for , very smooth , no pressure , no worries . i was very clear on what we wanted and the abided by our decisions and processed the paperwork for which we required . i highly recommend you consider going to chapman dodge as you first attempt to purchase your vehicle .
0	ohhh i wanted to like it ! we live in henderson , so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- i had to offer to pay lol so off we went . i ordered ny street dog , waffle fries & bbq western burger w/bacon . i have to admit when the food got to the table , in the cute little bar style baskets -- i turned to my roommate and said `` disgusting '' . it was so gross , to me ( and i 'm from the west coast ) but it was all chicago style -- like a mess . it was n't the type of food you can just pick up and eat , the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated , wet , soggy , mushy like dough like gross - which is where my `` disgusting '' game from . so the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog , like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled . it was not a good , high quality hot dog at all . what i did n't like was it was all pink - inside and out i do n't know i like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside . this dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard . i bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate . he cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing , and i wanted to take a picture but i felt silly - it was a big piece of mush . seriously like \u00be of it had been dipped in bbq sauce ........... it seems like the bbq burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with bbq/chili sauce . i took a bite , the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and i did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the bbq sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess , yucky - i set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away . i went to the bathroom to wash my hands . oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the `` natural '' fries , which ya , were very greasy . we ate all of the fries , because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good some kind of cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter . like i said i wanted to like this place , i like the d\u00e9cor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style . i 'll continue on my personal search for a great las vegas burger .
0	the worst thai food we 've ever had ! we ordered chicken satay ( it was the only good item we ordered ) . bbq chicken was very dry , crab pad thai was nasty , it had a weird smell . also prawns with lobster sauce was fishy . waitress was n't helpful at all . we ordered our food to go . as she gave our food which took about 30 minutes to get , not to mention there was only two other tables . she was standing there waiting for a tip . terrible food & service . never again ! ! !
1	go here ! i used to frequent montreal and never had a bad time at mcleans . right off st. catherine but not filled with canadian college kids or boston frat guys . its normally a bunch of locals trying to catch a hockey game ... or 10 of them from 5 different leagues at 1 time . food is good and drinks are priced fair . craig used to be the bartender and he was the man . drink alexander keiths and an upper cut . i seriously have a place in my heart for mcleans .
1	went this past saturday night , and like everyone 's said : - the outside of the club is worth the just the admission - paid $ 30 cover - drinks are $ 14-16 - jack and coke was strong , mind eraser was perfect - club makeup was about 90 % asian - that was fine with me , i 'm eoe . - dance floor was packed - a little small in proportion to the entire place - got there around 10 - wait was about 10 minutes - females were pretty aggressive in all aspects , seemed like most of them listened to 'took the night ' by chelley on their drive to vegas .
0	i think the rooms need an update . i mean , for the price , they 're not spectacular . staff were really nice though . the casino and bar/club/restaurant choices are fine , typical las vegas . the lobby is gorgeous , but you do n't have to stay there to see it !
1	my most recent visit here was quickly headed into the 2-3 star category , but thankfully turned into a positive one . the restaurant was only half full , and granted we had a party of 12 show up at 7pm on a monday night , they told us it would be 45-50 minutes of waiting for a table . we even offered to be split into two adjacent tables , and still , the hostess was convinced it would still take nearly an hour . so , we contemplated getting takeout , and were about ready to order when miraculously * poof * a table opened up . the service was excellent , and the big beef sandwich was great ! good food , decent atmosphere , although the `` legalize marinara '' t-shirts are a little over the top , especially in a heavy conservative part of town . anyway , i 'll be back . the unique and tasty dishes will ensure that .
1	we love nighttime nosh ! everything you could need they bring right to your door , and the delivery men i 've had are polite and easy to work with . people do n't believe me when i say you can have wine delivered to your door , but hello , you can have wine delivered to your door . one of the best services around , one of many reasons i enjoy living in tempe !
0	it 's shameful how `` downhill '' this place has gone . i used to be a huge fan when the sirrine 's owned it . i 'll stick to rancho de tia rosa ( which is owned by the sirrine 's ) next time . the service was painfully slow . now , i could understand that years ago when i used to go and it took 45 minutes to an hour just to get a table . but when only 4 or 5 tables are filled there 's no excuse for poor service . the salsas used to be so much better and more flavorful . they are a hint of their former selves . the salsa verde - previously a stand-out in the green salsa category - is mediocre at best ... and that 's a tremendous compliment . oddly enough -the chips are still some of the best i 've ever , ever , ever had . the food - like the salsas - is a shadow of its former self . it lacks the succulence , the flavor , and the wow-factor it had when dennis sirrine was calling the shots . it 's bland , slightly dry and just not there anymore . what was equally disappointing is they 've replaced their iced tea ( something used to drive across town for ) to a horrible concentrate . blech . considering this place used to be packed to the gills on a tuesday afternoon at 2pm and now you can easily walk in on friday at dinner time and have your pick of tables , the restaurant needs to recognize the issue and do something about it . they absolutely can not go on like this .
0	is n't it great when a new buffet pops up ? today i had the pleasure of trying this one for the first time , accompanied by robyn n. & norm r. this place appeared in the shell formerly occupied by crazy buffet # 2 , and they do n't seem to have changed it much , if at all , except that it 's slightly less expensive . here were some other observations on this visit : the good : * nice dining room . * friendly staff . * reasonable prices . * most food items properly identified . * proper lighting for both the food and the dining room . * big selection of 111 food items plus sauces & dressings . * medium selection of tasty sushi . * good mongolian style bbq with 4 meats & treats including water chestnuts , bamboo , etc . a few shortcomings : * it was too warm inside . * they did n't have quite all of the food out at 11 am opening time . * their drinking water had a snarky taste . it needs filtering . * the sushi table did n't have separate tongs for each item , including the meats . * the soft ice cream machine was out of order . they need to tighten things up a little here but overall i think it 's a nice place . weekday lunch buffet : $ 7.99/ $ 7.19 sr .
1	we love going there for their gyros and also the lamb burgers ... do n't miss the fries ... without a doubt the best in all of charlotte ..
1	when i say i love crap ! , this is exactly what i 'm talking about . keep your french restaurants that leave you hungrier than when you came in . at the the dragon house super usa # 1 chinese buffet , i am allowed to be the truly disgusting pig that i am . did i mention i 'm cheap ? so this place is heaven . many stick their noses up at chinese buffets , but as long as it tastes good to me , i will stuff my face with stir-fried anything for $ 11 . give me more of that sweet sweet msg and cheap meat . i want the diabetis ( sic ) and the food coma , that is why i 'm here . chinese buffets are temples to my third favorite of the seven deadly sins . the steaming trays of sweet & sour chicken , mongolian beef , rangoons and lo mein are as the stations of the cross . risking the consequences of delicious , affordable and potentially life-threatening round at the dragon house is something i 'm prepared to take going in . as anthony bourdain once said , `` '' if there 's not at least a 50 % chance of diarrhea when you eat something , it 's almost not worth eating . '' i can regret it in the morning , but binge-eating here is one my favorite guilty pleasures .
1	latest mega-resort in vegas owned by mgm . it 's going to eat the lunch of alot of the older casinos . really nice modern design and impressive silhouette from the outside ... this place makes the mgm look like a boutique hotel . room was phenomenal , better than either mandalay or the hotel rooms i 've had . super cool fixtures ( everyting connected to ldc computer , one touch drapes , etc. ) . awesome bathroom with glassed off shower & bathtub next to each other in a space bigger than most vegas entire bathrooms . would definitely stay there again .
0	this store is very dirty , wayyyy too busy , only 3 lanes open on a monday afternoon with about 15 people in each line . even the target greatland across the freeway had more lanes open with 5 , and they arent even a supertarget with grocery like this hell-hole is ! you ca n't park because everyone just walks right in front of you and the stupid employees decide right in front of the main entrance door is where they want to bitch about people that shop and spend their money to support their job . i do n't think i 'm ever going to hell-mart again , i 'll save my self trouble and money by purchasing my groceries at target and fresh & easy .
0	my boyfriend , jonny , and i went to silverado steakhouse only because we were already at the southpoint casino for a comedy show . we had no idea what we were getting into , so we had no preconceived notions or expectations . i ordered the beef short rib . it was swimming in salty gravy with what i am pretty sure was boxed mashed potatoes ( and again with lots of salt ) . jonny ordered the filet mingon . he asked for medium rare , but it was meant to be rare . i say meant to be because it was all pink inside , but no blood ! it was bone dry and again very salty ! we then ordered the cheesecake . jonny asked if the deserts were pre-made .. the waiter responded kind of shocked that we would even ask that . the cheesecake was most definitely pre-made . the plating was beautiful , but the cheesecake was hard and extremely cold ! the garnishes of raspberries , blueberries , and blackberries were not fresh . the stick of mint chocolate was delicious , however . jonny called a manager over to tell him about our experience . the manager seemed unfazed and comped one of meal items without us even asking , and the bill was still over $ 75 without alcohol .. which leads me to believe the manager is used to these complaints . the food was terrible . the service , however , was better than most places . the servers were very friendly and personable .
1	this visit here was very different from my last visit . the chefs have changed and i 'm here for restaurant week . instead of a menu with many selections we only saw a restaurant week menu that differed not completely but somewhat from the one posted on the web . i do note that on the website they do post , `` menu is subject to availability as we source all of our ingredients from very small producers . '' what i liked about the menu here for restaurant week is that they offer three courses of a starter , a salad and an entree so i thought that seemed very good since it 's a waste of calories ordering dessert unless of course it 's an outstanding dessert . they started us off with an amuse bouche of very creamy but also very velvety cream of cauliflower soup . my very rich little soup had crispy heirloom roasted cauliflower in it as croutons and was a nice surprise , also topped with a cheesy crostini . my starter was the hand rolled ricotta gnocchi , they were very light in texture and were well seasoned with herbs , seasoning and then were lightly crisped . the gnocchi mingled with with lots of tiny sweet local sun gold tomatoes and different sauces adorned the plate . my husband enjoyed a well crafted wagu beef bone marrow duo . one was adorned with lamb bacon and the other with a sort of onion jam . as delicious as the the heirloom sun gold tomatoes were in my starter dish i had very similar tomatoes again in my tomato salad . they were delicious again and a few other tomatoes joined the tomato party . fortunately i do love tomatoes , especially this quality tomatoes and can eat them all the time . i was looking forward to the jalape\u00f1o fritter that was on the web menu but tonights version was crispy seasoned croutons . i enjoyed the tomatoes but the croutons were a little too crisp for me as my fork was n't able to penetrate the sturdy little cubes . instead of some kind of cheese curd they made house made ricotta and i think that was a win ! instead of the black grouper with those black tiny lentils that i was looking forward too i had the halibut since that was what was offered instead . i do have to say the halibut was excellent and prepared to perfection , it was tasty and delicious but it was a very tiny piece as small or smaller weight watchers lunch portion being between two and three ounces . ( i 'm thinking two ) the vegetables on the side were also a very small portion but also excellent and i even enjoyed the sauces , one was lemongrass scented and the other was a tasty pea nage . for my taste i thought the chef was overly creative with the forbidden rice as it had flavors going on with it that were n't savory and seemed odd with everything else going on . i asked my husband to try it and he did n't care for it either but i note other people might like it . so i ca n't say it was bad i just did n't care for it . the service was very personal and right on until dinner with only the owner and his helper serving us . then every seat was filled and they were n't able to check on us and when we were done the helper instead of trying to sell us dessert says something like are you interested in dessert ? with what i thought was a stressed look on her face . the food overall was very good . this is a very tiny place with 5-7 tables ( depending on how they are pushed together ) you do need a reservation for here . this is a b.y.o.b . a $ 10 . cork fee is applied .
0	i do n't eat here but my girls need a little kfc fix every once and awhile . this location is close to my house so that is where i take them . could use a little fixing up inside and let 's be honest it is kfc . sometimes girls get chicken that should have been tossed but for the most part they are happy with their food .
0	well i did n't like it that much , i was very excited to eat an ostrich burger and a elk burger because i never had them before and do n't know about any other places in vegas that sell them . so i did and i was not satisfied at all it was very dry , either the person who cooked it did n't know how to cook it right or it just was n't good . any ways my friend told me the regular burgers were better than the gamy meats . and the salmon burger was ok too . i probably would n't go there again cuz 13 bucks for a tiny ostrich burger that was n't even good with fries and a drink almost 20 .
1	it 's been almost a year & a half since i reviewed this place , so it seemed time for an update ! mike c. joined me today , & the food theme was mexican . they have remodeled the place , gotten rid of the `` old west '' theme , & mostly gotten rid of the maze of booths you had to wend through to find your way back to your table from the serving area . after some excellent albondigos soup , it was on to the nice salad bar , which included real pieces of bacon , creamy cottage cheese , a good selection of cold fruit , & so on . unfortunately , it was somewhat downhill after that , as the `` mexican '' food was very gringo-ized & blah , apparently prepared for the minnesota palate , certainly not for us around here who eat spicy mexican food on a regular basis . with that said , i still think this is a good place , & i 'll keep it at 4-stars ... just do n't come on a thursday unless you want very mild `` mexican '' food ! lunch buffet $ 9.50 or $ 8.55 for members of their ( free ) fortune club .
0	avoid at all costs . horrible service and horrible food .
0	we recently dined there while visiting family in scotland . the food was very mediocre . i ordered the salmon . i took a couple of bites and knew it was not fresh . i called the waitress and told her . she said she would tell the chef . they did not offer to replace the dish and charged us for it . i became very ill in the night from the spoiled fish . not only was the food bad but the service and management was worse . we would never go there again !
0	nous sommes all\u00e9s au benelux le weekend dernier pour souligner un anniversaire . lors de ma soir\u00e9e , j'ai vu beaucoup de potentiel et je devrai surement y retourner a un autre moment pour y partager certaines impressions . mais voici un bon d\u00e9but . l'endroit pr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9cor tr\u00e8s industriel , une tr\u00e8s bonne touche qui se pr\u00eate bien \u00e0 ce type d'\u00e9tablissement . plusieurs coins et tables pour s ' y installer entre groupe d'amis par exemple . nous \u00e9tions l\u00e0 vers 11:00 par contre . nous n'avons donc pas pu profiter de la terrasse qui semblait tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able ! surtout avec cette chaleur suffocante qu'il y avait \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 tout ce beau monde entass\u00e9 ! pour ce qui est des bi\u00e8res , il y en avait pour tout les go\u00fbts et leur plateau de d\u00e9gustation est une tr\u00e8s bonne alternative pour les premi\u00e8res fois afin de trouver la bi\u00e8re qui nous convient . par contre , les bi\u00e8res manquait un peu de broue et d'effervescence . on aurait dit qu'il manquait quelque chose au tout pour en faire des bi\u00e8res parfaites . donc , j ' y retournerai c'est sur , et je me r\u00e9viserai si il faut ! bonne bi\u00e8re !
1	loved the service here ! from the greeter to our waitress claudia , everything was top notch ! my pancake was perfect , cooked but light & fluffy without me mentioning anything to the waitress . when we originally arrived , we were quoted a 50 min wait on a monday morning but left because we were hungry . went to max brenner ( which closed yesterday apparently ? ) and returned about 30-40 mins later and had a 10-15 min wait . if your looking for a delicious , cheap eat provided by happy & wonderful staff , look no further ! i would definitely eat here again if i 'm in the area ; - )
1	nascar 101 : top 10 tips for those novice fans . 1. shirt , optional . sunscreen , essential . 2. do n't bother getting all dressed up . from the draft of the cars , dirt will fly around and land all over you . so forgo wearing a flowy skirt too ... 3. ear plugs are a must ! protect those ear drums and for as little as $ 2 , you can be rest assured . 4. you can bring a small cooler ! do it . the race is long & hot ... and water is $ 4 a bottle . 5. if you do n't bring your own cooler , then carry cash . if you do n't have cash , bring your atm card . there are bofa kiosks all over . 6. the closest seats to the track are n't necessarily the best ( like in other sporting events ) . if you desire seeing a greater view of the entire track , go higher . 7. it 's not essential to get there on time . the cars go round and round and it does n't get exciting until closer to the end . 8. if you are an environmentalist , this sport will drive the `` mother earth '' in you insane ! there will be empty cans of beer & trash flying all over ... not to mention one of the main parts of this sport is using a lot of fuel . 9. you will smell a lot of fumes , feel the vibration of the cars , and see blurs whiz by ... if you get motion sick , take breaks from the track . 10. beer bongs are encouraged ... do n't forget yours , but i 'm sure you can find someone who will share theirs . the roar of the engines is really exciting ! i really liked watching how fast and flawless the pit crews worked too . it 's quite the experience to be there live ! after my first race , i read more about the sport ... pretty interesting . i think the next time i go , i 'm definitely renting a radio so i can listen in on the drivers and announcers . everyone should go at least once !
1	yogurtland is one of the better yogurt shops in the valley . a few indicators of a good yogurt place : -always packed -a variety of flavors that swtich out frequently -a family friendly environment ... and yogurtland meets all of these standards . the only con for yogurtland is that sometimes the machines are a little dirty , becasue the staff is usually in the back room or behind the counter , other than that it is great . i like how they let you do your own samples , becuase some other local yogurt stores do n't let you do that . also , i like that they have two sizes of cups available 16 ounces , and 20 ounces . what i love about yogurtland is their tart and their sprinkles ( but they call them `` jimmies '' ) . their tart is the best that i 've had at any yogurt store in the valley . it is refreshing , and sweet , ( while tart at the same time ? ) , and doens't give your mouth that dry feeling that some other tarts do . also , their sprinkles are to die for . i do n't know where they buy their sprinkles or what they do to them , but they are the perfect consistency- and for those of you that are less familiar with sprinkles- some come crunchy and the others come soft- and yogurtlands are the softest of soft ! definitely a win for me !
0	the only thing great about surrender is the outdoor view of encore beach club at night during the summer . surrender is a tiny , noisy `` music box '' that edm artists spin live just `` because of the money '' , lol ! ! ! it 's the out-of-control lil ' sister to it 's much mature & stable siblings xs & tryst inside the wynn/encore paradise ! security can be a bit ridiculous on suggesting places to dance , since the dance floor is limited & stand with a chick , since the bar is always packed with broke `` bar flies '' . i 'd much rather wait 'til the sun comes up , throw on some nice swim trunks & take a dip/chill in one of the several well-designed pools of the neighboring encore beach club to erase my `` surrendered nightmare '' ; - )
0	a warehouse full of whiskey -sure , sounds like fun . a few of us dropped by whiskey warehouse after a late dinner down the street . we arrived around 9:30 pm on a friday night and , while it was n't super crowded it was starting to fill up . the music was definitely loud and they were playing all sorts of tunes , mostly rap & pop when i was there . i agree with julia s. - the crowd was pretty frat like - but frat brothers 10 years post-college . we were able to order drinks right away and the bartender was fairly friendly and efficient . just as their namesake states , they have an extensive whiskey menu , and i would hope the servers are helpful in those selections , but none of us partook in those libations . they also had a decent wine selection , too . inside , ww sports a number of big flats screens and a partial brick/industrial feel inside . i imagine if you can score a table , this would be a good spot to hang with some friends for a few hours . they also offered some fairly sweet daily drink specials - one that caught my eye is their sunday drink special - $ 2 mimosas and $ 3 bloody marys . mmmmm hmmm ... ca n't wait until noon on sunday !
0	i guess maybe because they have a great location z tejas doesnt think it has too work that hard anymore . i was there with a large group and we were all extremely disappointed across the board . the service was really slow ( even with the bar being slow ) and almost non existent . it took so long to get drinks that some people were questioning if they had ordered or not . we had dirty plates and old drinks on our table that we couldnt get rid of even when we piled them up and shoved them all to the corner of the table . the food took even longer . 20+ minutes for shrimp tostada bites and the had clearly been sitting for a bit since the shrimp was cold . chicken burritos with minimal chicken-if you ask for more beware you will be charged 8 more bucks for it ! ! the cheese quesadilla didnt have enough cheese either . i was very disappointed and will not return . the only plus was sitting on the patio . maybe the service is better during there prime hours but it should be the same all the time , right ?
1	great service and even better food . i had a ribeye that was one of the best i 've ever had . my wife had the asparagus crab salad that she thought was good but nothing to write home about . the ambiance was five star ( it 's in the encore ) and the calamari appetizer was the best both of us had ever had . mindblowingly good ! ! i 'd give it five stars if my wife 's dish was killer . i would go back in a minute .
1	video poker , topless dancers , 7 am to 7pm happy hour , the dj is amazing , best party location in vegas ... enough said
1	used my groupon for a massage and blow out . massage was very relaxing . shampoo and style were ok. stylist was a little slow to style my hair , as he was using a blow dryer that was n't very powerful . overall a pleasant experience . friendly staff and central location . i will book a repeat appointment .
1	took my daughter and her friend to get their nails and feet done . the two of them had so much fun picking out what they wanted to do . they chose ladybugs in a pink flower for the fingernails and ice cream cones for the toes . she even put on spongebob on the tv for them too . they had so much fun .
0	high five for the quick and friendly service . we both had the sicilian lemonade which was really lemony and sweet , just as it should be . the pizza was well i guess ok - it was a nive thin base but could of done with being a bit crisper on the base . it was tasty though . it 's just another chain in another shopping mall but it was alright i guess ,
1	i 've never been to poland , but i reckon these are some of the best pierogies outside of that country . i 'm never going back to the frozen varieties . szmidts only !
0	food was good , but , the service was horrid . staff was more interested in spending time socializing with their friends who were also there .
0	perhaps if i were `` hammered '' i would have enjoyed this meal better ... i was sorely disappointed in this bbq spot . i ordered take-out on a sunday , and when i arrived i felt something was off right away . the place was dead ... not one person in the gigantic dining room , only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored . the bar however was pretty lively , maybe i should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food . ribs - all char and fat , barely any meat and extremely overcooked pulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of grease the sides , corn ( half a cob is considered a side for two ? ? ) cheese grits , worst i have ever tried , dry and flavorless cornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry sponge bbq sauce - disappointing at best , watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers ( like salsa sides ) . peach cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on top i really do n't like writing scathing reviews , but there was not one redeeming item in our meal . there are tons of great bbq joints in phoenix , this is not one .
1	we had a fantastic meal at the fig tree this past weekend . nicole was our sever and she was extremely knowledgable about the menu and offered great suggestions in terms of wine pairing . she 's been there for seven years and really knows her stuff . we started with warm bread which was served with whipped butter and a garlic spread . word to wise- go easy on the garlic . it 's potent . then we shared the scallop appetizer and the foie gras- both were very good . i started with a pinot noir and she had a pinot gris . we loved the spinach salad with the quail egg and bacon and maple vinaigrette . we added the goat cheese , because you know , it 's goat cheese . what should n't it be on ? she had the filet- huge , super rare , awesome . i had the duck . loved the duck , but wished for more sweet potato and fewer beans . i stuck with my pinot and my wife ended up with a great grenache which was the best of the evening and surprisingly inexpensive . for dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake . rich . dark . just right . in all , we had a great evening and will definitely return . tip : sitting upstairs puts you close to the restaurant 's only restroom . the down side ? steps . lots of them .
0	make sure to double check your order ! i did n't get any sauce with my mcnuggets even though it was on the receipt . i only realized it after i got back to my hotel room . also , they did n't ask if i wanted pie . they are supposed to ask you ; otherwise you are entitled to a free one . i did n't want to cause trouble , but it 's obvious that the customer service is lacking when people stop by from the clubs .
1	yummo ! very good authentic cuban sandwiches and pastries . fantastic breakfast and really liked that the omelet was not greasy . it was so tasty , filling , and budget friendly as well . it 's hard to find ironbeer and materva unless you 're at a cuban place and it was so exciting to get some . om nom nom . since we were driving back to la we picked up some great pastries for the ride home . they do compare themselves to portos ( they even have a sign out front that says it ) , however they are not portos . do n't expect the crazy lines ( yay ) . the selection of pastries is not as large but they are just as good !
0	i thought our stay was good until you locked us out of our room 2141 and lost our reservation . now someone more important needs our room they told us , and you still ca n't find our reservation . after my wife cried , they kept us in the room . they had put a walk up rate on our card since they lost the reservation . this despite showing them the travel agent voucher prepaid for our 3 day stay . they did reverse the charges and we should have our money back in a few days . even though they finally fixed it , getting locked out of our room when i was sick , with my stuff in the room , and being told more important people needed our room , will always stick with me .
0	brio did a wonderful job with my bff 's wedding reception , so for that , they get 3 stars . but the gluten-free pasta primavera was hard , chewy and bland and the mushrooms tasted microwaved . and the server only mentioned the complimentary reception wine after making it appear like you could only get cocktails ( which were not included with the wedding reception ) . y u hold out on me ?
0	i do n't like the physical location of the fiesta mall lenscrafters but i much prefer their staff at the optometrist 's office and the retail side . i do n't recommend booking appointments here online for your eye exams . the optometrist was very nice and so was his assistance , however the front desk staff for the doctors side leaves something to be desired . their area also looks messy and cluttered . after our exams ( my daughter and i both had appointments ) we choose frames and got everything ordered . the woman was perfectly nice and several people tried to help us with frames while we were looking , even offering pictures to do side by side comparisons with frames . after ordering everything , my glasses would be done in an hour and my daughter would have to wait 2 weeks . we went , had lunch , checked out the puppies in the store next to lenscrafters and came back . my sun glasses were fine , one small adjustment and my glasses were all good , it had been relatively painless , here was the kicker though , i was given a cheap lenscrafter case for my brand new glasses ( the normal ones ) and when i said i 'd like a nicer case ( i paid well over a thousand dollars for 3 pairs of glasses , when i purchase new glasses i expect a new case and i should get one ) i was told they did n't have a case for the brand i choose . hell , i will pay for a case but i will have a better case , i 'm not walking out with the cheap crappy case . so the gentleman that was adjusting my glasses went round and round with me about how the cheap case was in fact nice . i do n't need to kick back i just want another case . i was given a better case , not one i 'd have chosen , but i will take it . but he kept loudly stating that he 'd make sure i left with a `` not crappy case '' 5 or 6 times the lady who was looking for a case for me looked embarrassed that he was antagonizing and belittling my preference for quality when i paid for quality . they do n't take my insurance on the retail side , i paid for my glasses with cash and may be reimbursed for some of it . its not like this was a charity case and i should be grateful for anything that i get . i probably would n't have bothered with a review , however my daughters glasses have now taken the 2 weeks they said it would take and i 'm a little surprised i ha vent gotten a call yet , so i will followup with them . thinking about the whole ordeal makes me think that the fiesta mall location is a better choice , even if its further and i do n't like the area .
1	delicious chilean sebass , excellent mac n cheese , and a great wine selection but the service .... a little slow
0	yummy , great salad bar , but wish they had more veggie meat options though !
1	love it when a place is fast food and does n't taste like it . carambas is my go to when i need a quick mexican food fix without killing my wallet . pollo fundido is great , the salsas are awesome and put together from scratch . what 's even cooler is that they have a little mini bar at this location . the other locations do n't have that from what i 've seen . love it that they are home grown too .
0	the supposed filled donuts are actually sunken in the middle because there is not enough filling . a smear does not qualify as being a filling . their stock is always missing many if its donuts . the customer service is terrible . go to good donuts on gilbert and guadalupe .... so worth it and 5 star quality !
1	i 've been to this location a few times its just ok .. two other favorite location are on cheyenne and buffalo as well as the flamingo and arville location ! the half off shakes any time after 8pm is superb ! got ta love their banana ice cream shakes !
0	slow ass service in here , like really really slow . i actually started reading the menu i got so bored . all i wanted was some mixed veg noodles . when i got the `` food '' home i was brutally disappointed . the veg tasted frozen and the noodles were pure mush . only go if nowhere else is open .
1	great food , good prices , and a good menu . only downside is the wait is a little long and the place is cramped . overall a great place for your die hard mexican food lover .
0	if i could give 0 stars i would have . this was the worst night club experience i 've ever had . i would type in all caps ( out of outrage ) but that would just hurt to look at . we got in quick cuz we got put on the guest list so that was the only good thing of the night . the open bar for ladies from 10:30-11:30 that night was kind of wack , but expected i guess ( only mixed well drinks ) . also , it was overcrowded . like i am 100000 % sure they went over capacity . there was zero space to dance at all . all i could do was bob my head . i literally could not even breathe . third , people were pushing and shoving like no other . i almost cracked a rib ! fourth , there are rude & grimey people in this club .. ugh . some guy called me a `` fxckin b ! tch '' just because i asked him nicely not to push me . then someone groped my @ $ $ on my way out . the layout of this place is terrible . the staff is unfriendly and also rude . needless to say , i 'm never coming back to tao ever again .
1	this place is ahhhhh-mazing and i 'm not pho-king with you ! : ) i 'm so happy i found this place ! i had visited a pho place down the street called angelina 's but dang their service was terrible . on top of that , their food took foreverrrrrrrr to get . i just want some soup , dang it ! but now my problems are solved ! not only are the staff incredible and super helpful , especially peter but the food is out of this world ! the service is also quick and they are on top of it ! he explained all the cuisines to me and answered any question i had ! this place will see me again and again ! the spring rolls are super refreshing ! i usually get the number 14 with the rare beef and meatballs . yum ! they have that combo for $ 10 which is a steal ! i 've also tried their # 50 ! delicious broth ! and i have gotten a com dac biet . peter had said it had a little bit of all their grilled selections .. uhhhh delicious ! the bobas ? try itttttt . peter said coconut and jackfruit ? super super tasty . the coffee ? you 'll never be able to go back to starbucks ! people of glendale ! check out pho viet ! you wo n't regret it ! ! ! ! ! !
1	still working my way through the menu , but everything so far has been great . the knots are unbeatable and the pizza is pretty `` close '' , if you know what i mean . plus , they are definitely from ny , so they know what they 're doing in there ! i ca n't wait to try the sicilian , which i have n't had since i lived in queens ( five years ago ! ) . i always get sausage on my thin-crust and it 's actually sliced thin , not little crumbles . so good . the mini pie with two toppings for $ 7 and change is more than enough for me . are they the friendliest bunch ? not always , but do you really care ? i may be showing my new york , but just give me my pizza and send me on my way . this is a hole-in-the-wall mostly meant for takeout or delivery , not a five-star steakhouse . come for the pizza , not the freaking ambiance . i 'd recommend picking up a copy of the menu and calling in your order . for one , there 's a $ 1 delivery fee through eat24 while their printed menu says it 's free . i 've only ever paid for a delivery when ordering online , so keep it in mind . also , when ordering online , sometimes special instructions/substitutions do n't print out correctly on their end .
0	my girlfriend and i where totally lied to by everyone we talked to . finally someone from finacial aid pulled me into a side office away from the enrollment counselors and pointed out bachelor 's degree would cost a minimum of 90k ... i recieve the maxium amount of grants and loans , i still would have have to pay over $ 1000 out of pocket every month to cover tuition ... throughout the course of the meeting i consistantly asked why my finacial would n't cover the total cost of tuition when at other schools ( that cost the same per credit hour ) i would be getting a refund to help cover the cost of housing . everytime i asked it no one would answer me ... they just tried to push me to the point of signing papers and paying the application fee ... i went home , got online and did my own research , the reason their tuition ends up being more per degree is because they make you take 60 more credit hours ... for the same degree ! ! ! ! if i was going to 90k for an undergraduate degree i would attend an ivy league school ... f $ % ^ that school ... the best part is when the enrollment counselor could see that i was n't going to sign or pay anything until i did my own research , she started getting super aggressive to the point if she was n't a girl the meeting probably would have ended voilently ... how can she even get mad at me ? if they would n't have lied to me in the beginning i would n't have been there ... the situation felt like i was being screwed by a used car salesman ...
0	so dirty i was afraid to take my shoes off . is there a way to give a quarter star ?
1	great sushi and service . the 5th star just being held back because of the high prices . incredible ambiance and easy to make reservations online .
0	i was slightly hesitant in eating here again because the last time i ate here , i threw up . this time around , i got the tomato basil soup and chopped salad . the food was pretty good and the service was okay . i probably wont be back here , primarily because a lot of the dishes were so damn expensive .
1	j'etais tres contente avec la nourriture ici et j'espere a manger encore par-la ! translation : i was very happy with the food here and i hope to eat here again ! merci beaucoup pour l'experience tres extraordnaire .
0	i was searching for a place that served cheese curds last night and culvers popped up as being the `` highest ranking '' place with them . do not go here for the cheese curds ! ! especially if you 've ever had good ones at san tan flats , a & w or even buffalo wild wings . i do n't like the breading they put on them here - they tasted more like a bad mozzarella stick than a curd . not a fan . i did like my burger . fries were ok - not my favorite and i do n't think i 'd get them again . my husband 's chicken strips were good - just pricey ! i also liked how their place is set up . they have an area to order ( with a huge ) menu , and then a separate dining area . it makes it feel more like a sit down restaurant then fast food which is nice . the custard was so good ! ! i got the flavor of the day ( toffee pecan ) and i 'd come back just for it again ! ! be sure to sign up for their e-mail and text club . i got a bogo deal and a free scoop of ice cream off their yelp check in offer too ! made it under $ 18 for the 3 of us .
0	was n't impressed . i ordered a half rack , and mac as my side . the ribs looked good , and it was a healthy portion , but they just did n't have anything special going on . served dry , and i do n't think they spent much time in the slow cooker . the bbq sauce was pretty standard fare , and served in an awkward glass bottle that made for difficult pouring . the mac and cheese was bland , very disappointing . and a side tortilla was an odd addition for a rib plate . it was very clean , the staff was friendly . i wanted to like the place , but the flavor just was n't there . i kind of felt like i was at el pollo loco . for the plate and a bud light , i spent $ 20 . for a few bucks more i could have gone up the road to the sit-down bbq chain and had a much better meal , with bold sides and corn bread . with the handful of other bbq places in town running stiff competition with some real authentic down-home skills , these guys are going to have to step it way up in the flavor department if they want to keep up .
1	i typically use the drive-thru and can expect to wait about 5-10 minutes before i get my burger combo and go . the food has always been good and worth the wait .
0	stratosphere just does n't capture the vegas experience very well . it 's way to far to walk to the actual strip . the rooms their are not impressive at all . i stayed here years ago when i first visited vegas . a friend booked everything so i had no idea . it was cheap of course , but i would rather spend the extra and have the complete experience . since then i 've been staying at the venetian/palazzo , and i 've never looked back . oh yeah .... i gave them ( stratosphere ) an extra star because their buffet is pretty good for the money .
0	the prices are great but the wait is crazy just for picking up birth control that i called in on monday it has taken me more than an hour . i finally got called but they ca n't find my pills i ordered four days ago .. now i 'm still waiting and i 'll be surprised if they actually do anything for me . i should have known .. the first time i came here for my initial visit it took two hours with an appointment .. that 's only 30 minutes of actually being in the back getting checked up and an hour and a half of wit time ! : ( the only person that could finally help me was adrianna ! thank you !
0	for obvious reasons this airport receives 5 stars when you arrive to las vegas and about 1 star when you leave . the restaurant options are the polar opposite of phenomenal and the restroom was about 1 stage away from being a scene from the movie 'silent hill ' . avoid the chili 's too if you go here . checking in and going through security was n't too bad so i 'd suggest arriving no earlier than an hour before your flight . otherwise you will be enduring a longer visit to the mccarran airport than one should ever wish for ! if you brush into anything or open any doors i 'd suggest about a gallon of purell . ( southwest was great once they let us on the plane ! )
1	the mediocre : although good , the $ 24 spaghetti is not really justified by the price . stay away from that chocolate cake . it 's the heaviest , tiniest , piece of chocolate cake i have ever had . it 's good , but way heavy . the better : the short rib with farro risotto . oh so yum ! how can you screw up short ribs ? the out of this world : the panna cotta with guava soup and coconut ice cream . very few desserts i eat are memorable . this one is very memorable . for a panna cotta , this dessert was extremely light and had just a hint of sweetness ( i thought the guava was going to make it super sweet , but it did n't ) . i would come back and eat here just for this dessert . no joke ! our service was great . request a table near one of the windows so you can see the fountain show at bellagio .
1	looking for an authentic mexican restaurant in downtown las vegas ? look no further . la comida has arrived . new restaurants are opening left and right in las vegas , especially in the downtown area . one things for sure , la comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food , appetizers , and fried food . here at la comida , you get authentic tasting mexican dishes . when you think of morton 's , their steakhouse , n9ne , ghostbar , and rain comes to mind . and because this is a morton 's establishment , expect no less than quality , upscale , and great service . my first thought upon arriving here was `` wow '' . although this place was packed on their very first night , we were greeted by almost every staff member . smiles are free and we got them . my second thought , another `` wow '' . las vegas ' who 's who was here tonight . i 'm not going to mention names , but the energy was surely in the air tonight . there 's seating indoors , at the bar , and at the patio outside . the ambiance includes an attentive staff , wide open restaurant , and a ton of people watching . can you imagine this place on the weekend ? this restaurant was extremely busy , but there 's no rush once you 're in and no one seems to be rushing you out . in other words , this restaurant has a chill feel to it . as for the food , you really ca n't go wrong . everything made here is authentic . the food was so authentic that i even had a tough time reading the menu . but our lovely server , camila , took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short spanish lesson . my main dish was their carne de res a la parrilla ( beef skirt steak ) . the steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers . the wild mushrooms were so good that i could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte . as for the steak itself , i wish i had seconds it was that juicy . terri r had their camaron de golfo ( buttered shrimp dish ) and for dessert their platanos fritos ( banana w/ice cream ) . it 's obvious that terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing . plus , she told me numerous times `` i love my food '' . it 's awesome when new restaurants open in las vegas , specifically downtown las vegas . owners jenna and michael morton open it 's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week . jenna and michael did n't miss a beat with their soft opening . the restaurant was fully staffed , the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full , and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at dtlv . even better , they took the time to meet , greet , and take photos with everyone . my suggestion ... visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience . la comida : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=chwkzvh8fifg-2v1j7msoa & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq verano de jalisco : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=m6mbrlebv7ratoy3s0xiag & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq chips and salsa : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq carne de res a la parrilla : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=cgxopexezitzzmqh3nafia & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq pescado a la parrilla : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=j2lov8mofoqhnyinqqk0ua & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq tres leches : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=o51v6hxfs3vrqf1apesbpq & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq oh yeah ! : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=rtfqn0o9rrsab1erfofumg & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq bar talent ( they 're so nice ) : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=jqp5ie6n29jnrhefu7xfpw & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq kitchen : http : //www.yelp.com/user_local_photos ? select=updmio1b9ed1mmgq_wmcrq & userid=y3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq ps : ca n't find this place , look for the hanging monkey on 6th street . special thanks to cisco a. for inviting us for dinner .
1	milunka is great ! i never really write yelp reviews but i decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of . her facials are great because she does extractions , which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done ! i 've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again !
0	hotel and room were fine but i was very disappointed that they would n't let the shuttle take us to or pick us at the light rail station . the other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble . probably wo n't stay here again .
0	i hate to say it , but darren and i were both a little let down by toonseum . darren 's a big comics fan ( luckily he knew who most of the artists were since there was n't anything telling visitors who the illustrators were ) and i am big into animation ( i went to school for it at one time ) , but we were underwhelmed simply because they do n't have much to look at . there 's just a hall and then a larger room that they use for meetings and such ( it can be rented out or reserved i think ) . it could be a really cool museum if there was just more to it . i got bored in here after a half hour . the gift shop is pretty cool , though even if they do n't have anything you ca n't find at other comics or book shops in the city ( they have mostly graphic novels for sale , some new comics , and some toys and curios ) . but for $ 5 , it 's a fun , harmless way to kill some time downtown .
0	this is becoming a bit of a staple for lunches . i went with sister and her two small offspring the other day and we had a very enjoyable time . the music was a bit loud when we first went in , but the food was lovely and plentiful , and once the music was turned down , we actually had an enjoyable and ambient time . there is plenty of space at lunch time for child wrangling , and as mentioned staff and food were good . some excellent different menu item sizes meant that my sister could have a couple of small dishes , while i had a great plate of nachos . the chilli was excellent , jalapenos were not too hot , the guac was plentiful and the cheese adequately melted . jeni 's dishes looked and tasted excellent . i really enjoyed the leftover bits . orange juices for the kiddiewinks were well received and the staff did n't really mind my niece `` dancing '' on the sofa - she thinks dancing is the same as bouncing . why 3 stars ? well i 've only been for lunch and a few after work drinks things . i 've not really experienced it to the same level as other places i 've given 4 stars too . i 'm also trying to be more discerning in my reviewing . i also get this weird feeling that it does n't really know what it is . bar ? restaurant ? who knows . oh and the notice to say there was n't card service was hidden behind the pegged open door when we went in so we did n't realise till after . it would have been nice for the staff to have told us this when we ordered so we could organise to pop to a cash machine , instead of my sister being forced to do this after what can only be described as dealing with a dual poo-ocalypse .
1	had the dynamite sandwich , which is described as so on the website : `` an explosive blend of sliced brisket , peppers , chilis , onions and jalape\u00f1os , sauteed with red diamond sauce , and piled on a jalape\u00f1o roll with melted pepperjack . '' it was very good , very spicy , and i 'm definitely getting more of them . our favorite item was the fried onion strings , however . you know the problems with ordering onion rings at a restaurant : too much breading , or the onion is nasty , or you take a bite and all the onion pulls out of the breading and you have nothing left to eat except empty breading , or they are too greasy ? these do n't have any of those problems . very light crust , super-light , and the onions can be tasted and they are good onions , not too strong or too sweet . no grease at all . we loved them for $ 1.95 and next time i 'm ordering more of them , since the plate is a little on the small side . that 's my only complaint - the portions were a little on the small side . but you can remedy that by going back on the first wednesday of every month , when they have a $ 12.95 ayce lunch buffet . one last problem - they are only open for lunch , and weekdays only . hours : 10:30am - 3:00pm monday - friday . if they 'd expand hours and make their portions a smidgeon larger , i could give them 5 stars .
0	went in for the first time for a needed pedi . the tech spent a great amount of time massaging my legs so i was in heaven but when it came time for my callous remover , she skimmed over my feet . i want to go back and have them redo the callous remover but for a place that charges $ 1 to use your debit card , they might try to get more money from me . the man ( the manager maybe ? ) spoke on his cell phone my entire time . i could tell you all about his upcoming travel plans . when i asked to use the restroom he followed me back and stayed on the phone while i was in there ! many pedi chairs available but only 3 techs working . customers left while i was there because of wait . not the best vibe . not the worst business but i 'll be going elsewhere next time . i 'd say save your money on this place or at least pay with cash .
0	i really really really wanted to like this hotel . i know m.c . had the fire on the top floor which gave them ( the insurance money ) and the perfect opportunity to display a new brand to cater to their higher end market . unfortunately , my reviews echo that of the lackluster staff and accomodations if you were to pick between this hotel and the less expensive mandarin oriental , the clear winner here is m.o . dont waste your time with hotel 32. the problem here is that they just took staff and tried to train them to cater to the needs of hotel 32 clientelle , but it just doesnt work . and this goes from everything to the driver , the vip services desk , the `` suite assistance '' and lounge attendants . check in : this was a complete disaster- the driver picked us up from the airport as planned , and then it all went down hill from there . i asked the driver where to go once we got there and he said `` inside '' and pointed that way after giving him a $ 10 tip . we saw the check in desk and in we went . after a brief wait , we checked in , but the check in lady was surprised we didnt go to guest services where we were supposed to check in . we tried to check in and they gave us a very tiny studio . i mentioned we had a suite and she said , no , you dont . i told them poliety to please check the reservation and she said , `` this is what you booked , the studio '' mind you , i booked directly with m.c . after much back and forth , she finally made a phone call and gave us the accomodation we paid for ... or so we thought . we had requested a bath and of course , our accomodation didnt have one . then it went more down hill . she asked us if we need help with our luggage and we said yes , and she said to go by the elevator and wait .. which we did .. but nothing .... nothing after 20 min . i went back and requested bell services again but i was just told to `` wait '' again , nothing . taking our bags , we went upstairs ... we were told by the front desk staff we would be greeted by a suite assistant to show us around , but this never occured . we found the room of course and only to realise at this point there was no bath tub . i didnt want to start the back and forth again because it was my fiance 's birthday and i was just like , `` to heck with it '' . room accomodations are nice . simple and stylish . not too big , not too small . just right . shower is very nice , but ours didnt work properly . i can echo the other reviewers that the sinks do not drain ( yes , you will read this in other reviews as well ) . maybe because we are on the top floor , but yeah , still annoying . we walked out and then we were greeted by a suite assistant . there is a very small lounge up there from 7 - 11pm you can get 1 or 2 hors d oervres . again , this is a very simple set up . no free alcohol , no cheese and crackers . just pot stickers and some cheese cake in a shot glass . they have a tv and some couches . an attendant but she was quiet and didnt offer anything . our suite assistant asked what time we would like house keeping . we said after 11 but of course , they started knocking at 9am . i do n't know . later , while printing my boarding pass , i met christina and also joel . special shout out to those two who are extra helpfull . they work in the hotel 32 and were able to print out my boarding pass and also hear some of the frustrations . while cristina did seem to be concerned and made ammends , she did say `` this is the first ive heard of this '' but if you read the reviews below , a lot of what im saying is echoed below in other reviews . the vip lady downstairs in vip services ( the one with the new york accent ) seems to act as if you are troubling her each time you speak with her . she also cant read . i asked her to read back my confirmation and she had to read it 3 - 4 times before getting it right . nothing wrong with dyslexia , of course , but its hard to confirm a reservation when you have to go over it so many times clearly and they just dont get it . all in all , take your accomodation to mandarin . you will at least be treated like a human being there and wont have to worry about so many mishaphs . i wanted to like hotel 32 but i know we wont be back anytime soon .
1	best burgers in vegas hands down !
0	i like this place . every time i come there 's a small line , even on opening night and the screens are n't bad . they give student discount except on the weekends . they always give military discounts so that 's another reason why i like coming here . oh , you also get free refills on popcorn too , so eat up !
0	i went there for dinner one evening last week with some friends . we all thought our food was very good and the service was fine . my only complaint is that i parked in a public parking garage off of mill ave and brought my ticket to the restaurant to be validated . i just assumed that all business do that for their customers . i was wrong . cafe boa does not validate parking . i had to pay $ 6.00 to park my car which i was n't prepared for . way to encourage customers to patronize your business ! t
0	i went to notorious burgers after seeing their coupons on several different mailers . i was not sure what to expect , but at the prices for the burgers , i was expecting something good . unfortunately , this restaurant failed to deliver . before i get to the food , i should point out a few things that really detracted from the dining experience . when i went into the restaurant , i noticed it was quite dark . after looking around the floor and seeing how dirty it was with the remains of food and even a spilled drink , i concluded that the lack of lighting is to hide how poorly the establishment is cleaned . there also seemed to be a lack of servers , and the wait time for everything was quite long . finally , the air conditioning was either not working properly or was set high , as it felt very hot inside and i saw someone at the table in front of me using a makeshift fan . i ordered a burger using the make your own option . while the burger itself was not bad , the toppings were mediocre at best . i did not like how both the ketchup and mustard were very spicy , and the lettuce and tomato were not appetizing looking at all . for the prices that were being charged , even with a coupon , the food should have been better . there is absolutely no excuse for the lack of cleanliness in the restaurant , and it was an uncomfortable experience waiting around a long time for the food . the overall experience was bad , and i will not be returning .
0	i found this restaurant to be very clean , and the service was great ! we had a very helpful waitress who helped us first-timers to find things that we would be happy with . the service was great - all around . quickly seated , quickly had drink order taken . had appetizers , the chicken lettuce wraps , and they were better than pf changs , and the serving size was generous ! nice that they had a full bar of course . : ) the best part was the quality of the dishes though . very tasty meals , and i enjoyed the orange chicken . the only thing keep this from a five star review for me was the fact that it had a fishy smell in the place to remind me that they serve sushi . i am not saying it was bad , but just a little too much for me . nonetheless , the service and the food quality both mean i will certainly be back again ! enjoy !
0	i wish i had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before i ordered . it was stale . mushrooms were canned . did not like getting hit with the $ 0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with . i had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work . food was delivered fast . it 's an ok stop if you do n't have much time for lunch .
1	after making clubbing a higher priority then dinner , i came here way past 11pm . fortunately this place stayed open until midnight . i made a quick trek across the bridge on sands blvd from the wynn and to the palazzo to get my munchies on . the decor at this place is definitely stylish . you ca n't beat the bull infront of the restaurant . it definitely keeps up with the 5 star palazzo appeal . not to mention theres a lamborghini store right next to the restaurant . all the cars were covered up , and the area was closed off . i guess you have to pay to see or take pictures of those sweet rides . i ordered a salmon pizza which came with cream cheese , olives and onions . this was the first time i ever had fish on my pizza , but it tasted wonderful . it was n't a deep dish , but more of a light and thin cracker style crushed . the food was delicious and i was even more delightful to see the bill at $ 22 . this is not bad for a place where i got a strip view and a free pirate show at the ti across from this place . definitely ask for the outdoor seating when you visit the dal toro ! here is a clip of the view we had from our table : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8omwfqnrqqg
0	the entire property is run down , kinda creepy and pretty yucky . i had rented some inline skates thad had moldy inserts . i think they may be the only roller rink in madison so you do n't have too many options . obviously this place is popular with kids and they do n't seem to notice all the blight so we would just grin and bear it .
1	vegas is a foodie town , and aria has a lot of wonderful restaurants . if you ask me , julian serrano is the best restaurant in aria and it 's one of my favorite places to eat in las vegas . i love this restaurant . service is top-notch and fast . for a party of 14 , i was worried about the wait time for food . no need to worry , they know what they 're doing ! food started coming out almost immediately . tapas are a terrific option for large groups . the pace of dishes coming out was perfect . also our waiter was able to split up the bill ( we ordered in groups of 3 to 5 people ) . finally , the food . it 's excellent ! ! everything is amazing but i particularly recommend the calamari , which is among the best i 've ever eaten . other notable dishes include the salmon , the risotto , croquetas , peppers , papas bravas . you simply can not go wrong eating here .
1	my husband found a dog in bad shape late saturday night , so i needed a vet that was open on sundays . i found lone mountain animal hospital through a yelp search , and they fit me in to their tight sunday schedule . the entire office worked hard to make my nervous and timid new friend feel safe and at home . dr. beckes was gentle and so sweet . nice clean office , fair pricing and good staff . thank you !
0	the ambience was very nice with a pretty cool band was playing , the salmon panini we was pretty good but why it only received two stars ? we ordered which perhaps is the worst pizza i 've ever had ! i 'm not a picky eater by any means but they should seriously take it off the menu , i 've had better frozen pizzas !
1	yelp challenge ! started 8/20/2011 ( 11 of 365 ) . the best time to come here : happy hour ! all tapas are half off ! must order items : - duck tacos ! my ultimate favorite tapas plate here ! - crispy coconut shrimp - mac n ' cheese - dumplings dessert must try : mini donuts w/ a side of ice cream . yum ! this is a great place to come in a small group and share the small plates paired with a glass of wine . waiters/waitresses are super nice here , and the ambiance is splendid . make sure to be seated at a booth ! great date place too !
0	the peanut brittle is great . the customer service sucks !
1	just went back for lunch and drinks and i 'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service . everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff . yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront . had the family sliders to try out all the different ones . the brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group ! ! the mojito 's were still kick ass !
0	pitas are always good . however at this location the water taste like they poured it from the toilet bowl . the server brought out lemonade that taste like something from mars . also he did n't bring out the food or do any refills . not impressed with the service but pitas are always good . good luck on the drinks because what we had sucked ! !
1	this place has awesome kimchi chigae , kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced . the service is hit or miss here . but probably one of the best korean places on the east side .
1	amazing service and amazing people . no bs ! ! ! highly recommended ! ! best alternative for dealership / casa ! ! ! !
1	i love kiss the cook . i do n't know if it 's the sweet childhood memories of sunday breakfast with my grandparents after church , its country chic charm , or its old school location near downtown glendale , but i just love it . i 've been here countless times and it 's always a pleasure . the food is good for what it is , and cheap to boot . i think the last time we had breakfast here our tab was a whopping $ 13 ( excluding tip ) . and we ordered a ton of food ( the hubs had to order a million sides to get what he wanted ) . the biscuits and gravy is always delicious and served piping hot ( the only way to eat it ) . everything else is pretty standard breakfast fare , and the basket of mini muffins is always a delight . lunch is good , too . if you 're in the area , or looking for a unique experience , definitely visit kiss the cook . then head over to downtown glendale for some antique and boutique shopping and old town sightseeing .
0	8/6 : i went to the one located in the m resort and casino . the food is alright . good but nothing special . i would n't have guessed it made an appearance on tv . a bit pricey for what it is , although they do serve you huge portions , so save the leftovers and it 's like 2 meals . pretty heavy food . the presentation was awesome . beautiful environment with a nice view . i 've had the tractor driver combo ( 2 egg whites , 2 sausages , and waffles .. $ 14.95 ) and andy 's sage fried chicken ( $ 15.95 ) . for breakfast/brunch i 'd much rather go to cracked egg , egg works , or the griddle . you 'll most likely spend less for around the same portions , plus i think they taste better . i might revisit if a friend wants to try it out .
0	as previous reviewers have mentioned , it 's rather ridiculous that elephant house seems to milk all it can out of the fact that j.k rowling wrote harry potter here . she probably wrote one page or something and it 's pretty ridiculous the prices that this place charges just because they know harry potter fanatics will pay them just because they want to say they 've been here . i agree with many of the other reviewers , unless you 're really really into harry potter then give this place a miss , everything about it is standard ... apart from the prices which are extortionate . elephant house overlooks greyfriars graveyard and i went on a ghost walk there once only to be informed , yet again that elephant house was the birth place of harry potter . enough already !
1	i always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at greens & proteins ! i usually get the bison cheese steak wrap in a spinach tortilla . side of sriracha sauce . amazing ! also try the tofu fries , they are delicious . top it all off w a green wellness juice and you 've got the perfect balanced lunch ! !
1	my first experience at stalzy 's can be summed up in one word : souuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup . the day i grabbed grub they were dishing up mushroom barley . a mean , mean mushroom barley that rivals my mom 's . great flavor . great mush to barley ratio . thick soothing texture . i 'd slurp that sucker again if they had it . ( anyone know where they post the soup of the day ? twitter ? fb ? ) after my soup i dove into the combo , half pastrami and half corned beef on toasted rye . it was tasty , perhaps a little fattier than i prefer , but great flavor and not overwhelming-can't- stuff-it-in-your-mouth-large . i 'm excited to get back there because their other sandwich offerings made it hard to decide which wich .
0	seen this place a few times , decided to walk in to ask for a menu , they said no menu , just like that not helpful at all . place was completely empty besides me then this security guard walked in and they offered him a sample but not me . wanted to order a soup but was completely ignored then this lady who did n't understand english came out and could n't help me at all so i left frustrated . with no food or tea !
1	got a groupon so decided to try mind over batter . have had caketini often as it is at the mall and i think mind over batter is the winner . loved the lemon raspberry . shop was cute and service was fast and freindly . i get the cupcake is the new hot item in desserts right now ... but without a groupon i would not pay full price .
0	please save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else . this is by far the worst acura dealership i 've ever dealt with and they obviously do n't care about their customers or getting their customers business . i walked into the dealership and asked an employee ( who it turned out worked in the service department ) to direct me to the service department . i waited at the front desk where he sent me for someone to help me , while i did no less than 5 service department employees ( including the one who directed me ) stood around in a gaggle even occasionally making direct eye contact with me . none of them bothered to give me the time of day so i took the initiative and went to the cashier 's desk to seek assistance from the women sitting there . i followed this women outside where she went to seek answers from the other employees . afterwards she came back to me and proceeded to chastise and blame me for not being helped . her logic was that i did n't receive service because i parked my car in the service department 's parking lot and walked inside to get help instead of driving it into the entrance of the service garage . seriously ? ! ? ! ? there is no sign that says `` if you need an oil change drive your car into unintuitive location and if you do n't we wo n't bother to help you instead we 'll stand around with our hands in our pockets '' . if that sign existed i would partial agree with her rebuke . so let me sum this up : i parked in the most intuitive place i could find , received instructions from an employee who then systematically ignored me , then when i sought help from a different employee i was ridiculed in front of the rest of the employees who failed to help me in the first place .
0	typically , qua has been very good in service and everything else they offer . however , during my last visit ( the week of ces ) . with the ces going on , the spa was completely empty , you had the choice of massage time in 30 minute increment for the whole day . i could n't believe how slow it was . for the apast 5 to 6 years on my visit to caesars , i 've always received a back-to-back classical massage . for whatever the reason , they seems to have discontinued this service starting 2012. considering , how empty the spa was , they might make an exception . most business will make an exception on a slow days . they rather keep it busy than leaving it empty . so , i had requested to speak to a manger . however , this rude , cocky man name toby responded saying `` i am the supervisor and i said no to your request . i am the supervisor and what i say goes '' basically yelling at me telling me how important he was and he has the final say . i requested that i still wanted to speak to a manger . he yelled back at me stating `` she 's busy . she does n't have the time to speak with you . i have the full authority and answer is no '' i never did get to speak with a manager to provide a feedback to this rude sob they have for a supervisor . i also did not get a massage at qua during the trip . instead , i receved an awsome massage at canyon ranch spa at the venetian . they were perfect to the last detail . i still like qua since i actually like caesars palace . however , qua spa needs to look elsewhere to hire a better person to man the front desk at the qua . with the like like toby claming to everybody that he is the supervisor and telling everybody that he rather like to keep the place empty than providing a service ... well good luck to them . this little bald headed toad must have kissed all his boss 's behind to still be a supervisor .
1	i have been meaning to get around to trying this place out ever since i saw it on tv . the timing was never right ... until now . i have to thank my two friends , rob & steph , who finally got me that elusive visit to bachi ! it 's not located too far from the strip . but definitely an area i had never even traveled , even living here 7 years . inside , it had a nice clean , look . they were fairly busy for lunch , but the wait was n't terribly long , 15-20min . there was 3 or 4 burgers i wanted to try but i suppose i 'll have to return to try them all hehe . i decided on the spicy miso burger . i believe my friends had the bahn-mi & wagyu cheeseburger . we also shared the oxtail chili cheese & truffle parm fries . my burger contained onions , shishito peppers , roasted garlic , swiss cheese , apple vinaigrette , a fried egg and spicy miso sauce . i loved the sauce . little spicy , the subtle savory flavor of miso . and ca n't argue with a fried egg on any burger or sandwich , at least i would n't haha . great burger . the oxtail chili cheese fries were also awesome , although it did cost twice as much as the other fries . the truffle parm fries i could n't really taste any truffle . the ramsay burgr truffle parm fries were definitely alot better . service was good from start to finish . i absolutely have to return to try more of their burgers !
0	table of 4 , wait was 20++ minutes late on a thursday night . no bar to wait in , plus no alert system ( buzzer or whatever ) so we could n't wander around the casino . once we were seated , the food was great ..... just burgers but lots of toppings , etc . nothing bad nor was it overly memorable . very sufficient for a bite in harrahs !
0	what a terrible dining experience ! my girlfriend and i decided to try this restaurant because we wanted to go to a nice restaurant for our anniversary , and because we are both wine lovers . when we were seated at our table our server came over and started speaking in spanish to us . neither of us are very fluent in spanish , so we kindly asked him if he could speak to us in english . his reply was `` no ! you should know the language , so you must try '' . first of all , i realize that i should know a second language , but a fine dining restaurant is not the venue in which i 'd like to buff up on my spanish skills . next came the wine . that was delicious , and the highlight of our experience . when our entrees arrived , the server did not leave . he asked us about the wine in spanish , and made us try to reply to him in spanish . he said `` i 'm not leaving until you say it correctly '' . then he asked us where we were from and we replied `` san diego '' . he wanted to know how long the drive was . then then went on to say `` the reason i 'm asking is because the girl that i was dating lived in san diego , and we used to meet in barstow or victorville , get a hotel room , and then drive back our separate ways . do you two think that i did the majority of the driving ? it does n't matter now though , she broke up with me ... but whatever '' first of all , yes ... you did do the majority of the driving . second of all , i do n't want to hear about your sexual escapades while i 'm trying to eat my dinner ( which by the way was a terrible overcooked piece of pork ) . not worth the money . got back to the hotel after dinner , and about 4 hours later we were both very sick from the food and spent the rest of the night running to and from the bathroom . take your money , and spend it elsewhere !
1	i loved the ambiance ! ! it 's a lot smaller than the sea in brooklyn but same theme . really cute place for date night . do n't let the fact that 's in bally 's steer you away ! ! ! it 's a classy/trendy little spot . food was really good . the reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 is the fact that i got extremely sick immediately after leaving there . even though that happened , i would still go back and give it another shot . i really enjoyed the food/experience .
1	themed after an old fashioned ice cream parlor , churn is a hot spot for locals to grab a scoop of hand made ice cream , which is made on site . when i visited churn , the line went out the door and winded to the back of the shop . while i waited , i preoccupied myself by exploring ; along with the display of candy and other kiddish delights , there was a cool cassette tape wall , which had about a hundred cassette tapes mounted to the walll . it was only about a 10 minute wait before it was my turn ! all i need to say is s'mores sundae ! ! ! for $ 6.50 , you get scoops of chocolate ice cream , hot fudge , graham cracker pieces and marshmallow fluff torched until nicely charred . simply scrumptious ! i also ordered a scoop of peach & honey on a pretzel cone . i did n't care too much for this flavor but the quality is definitely there . it 's something good to try once but i probably would n't get this flavor again if i were to come back .
1	i have only been here for the lunch buffet , which , at $ 8.99 is a steal . seriously , this place is great . it tends towards to more traditional , heavier north indian cuisine , but all of it is done to perfection . the na'an is wonderfully cooked and always plentiful . this place is also great because it offers a wide selection of vegetarian options . a little off the beaten path , but worth checking out !
1	the food here is amazing . i have tried more then half of it and it 's all great . the staff is fun and the customers new and old mike you feel at home . this is a great place to relax and have a blast .
0	a one hour wait on a thursday around 845 ? not cool . then having terrible service because it 's close to closing time , definitely not ok. foods ok. ( i like their sanwhiches/pasta , but pizza is average . ) not worth the wait .
0	meh , meh & meh ..... i 'm just glad i did n't the $ 8-10 dogs ! ! ! ! ordered a few dogs and was not impressed at all . the dogs they use just do not have a great texture or flavor ! ordered the poutine fries and they sucked as well ! not enough gravy , nor enough cheese curds .
0	food was borderline satisfactory & service was horrible . i ordered a teriyaki bowl , miso soup & large drink . i asked if i could get my teriyaki 5-10 minutes after my soup so it wo n't get cold while i 'm enjoying my soup course . i asked this because in past visits they would arrive at the same time . they arrived at the same time again . i also informed them that they were out of iced tea . they did n't seem to care . an hour later , still no tea . they made no effort to make tea . it takes 5 minutes to brew tea .
0	esthetically pleasing but the service is absolutely terrible ... i was told by the bartender at holsteins : `` it 's 1:30 am in vegas , expect to spend some money '' ( because he did n't tell me that in order to sit in a booth , each guest had to purchase $ 20 worth of food and drink ) . this same person at holsteins pocketed my 54 cents in change and did not give me a receipt . when i asked for a copy of my receipt i was told : `` i will have to dig it out of the trash '' -- - i did get a copy of my receipt and their trashcans must be sparking because my receipt was spotless and crisp . i was going to let this slide because i thought that after i told the floor manager ( of the floor we were staying on ) about this issue , he would do as he said and `` discuss this with the management team and make things right '' but i did n't ever hear back from him , nor have i heard back from the hotel after i got home and emailed them about this experience ( i waited one week and now i 'm here letting y'all know not to waste your money here ) . also similar to other people 's reviews : our telephone did n't work - they had to replace it twice . despite me informing them several times that a lamp did n't work , they did n't pay any attention to it . go elsewhere ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	what i like about going to vegas midweek is how almost every place to eat is easily accessible and not overcrowded . you can basically walk up to almost any fine dining establishment and get seated without a reservation . with that said , i came across seablue pretty much on a whim because i was just looking for a fancy dinner at a celebrity chef joint that would n't exceed $ 100 . my original choice to eat that night was mesa grill , but their menu did n't appeal to me at the time and i felt compelled to venture down the strip to mgm since i like their restaurant alley near the monorail entrance . shibuya was a little out of my range so i walked over to seablue and liked their diverse menu . plus , i assumed that since it 's michael mina , it must be good . inside is very dark and intimate with water flowing down the walls . the ambiance and decor worked for me as they complimented my food . great place for a date . i ordered their seablue paella ( $ 42 , http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xe-poxz9cedao-q7pqktw ? select=kvrxmmlxuu30xc-rzhsqdw ) because i was intrigued by the fact that it had rabbit and quail eggs . before the course they serve you a paper funnel full of pita flatbread with hummus , goat cheese , and babaganoush ( hella good ! ! ! ) . the paella definitely was n't your typical valencia style and it was n't as much in quantity , but the quality was very good and every bite had a nice surprise as like all paellas . the rabbit tasted like chicken though . i guess that was expected . my server was very attentive and actually suggested the paella for me , and i 'm glad he did . i also peeked over and saw someone eating their kobe ribeye , it was huge and looked good also . overall , seablue was a nice experience for me . i would n't mind going back there again to try that kobe ribeye and everything else they have to offer , but with new places opening up on the strip and a lot others to try , it might be hard to lure me back anytime soon .
1	i still love this place after all of these years . its so nice to stop by and grab a cold one & i did while i waited for another show to start . its such a great spot for people watching as well . i am glad that through all the changes at ph this is something that has not changed .
1	thunderbird pools is definitely better than the big pool companies like paddock and shasta . -estimate was very straight forward . i told them what i wanted and he gave me an estimate for the work . all the other pool companies kept trying to sell me up and telling me how i needed this and that . -estimate was equal if not cheaper -did n't charge extra for doing simple things like removing the diving board and bolts that was no longer needed after remodel ( other pool companies wanted an extra $ 200 just to do that ! ) -work was done quickly and on time -had some issues with the pool light but they fixed in a good manner
1	the place gets pretty crowded . the people working there were friendly . i tried one of their favorites - picnic with sweet potato salad . the sandwich was very good . the salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich .
1	so , my girlfriend wanted a pair of jc 's or two . great . i went with her to the store to pick them out and was a bit surprised at how the staff just stared at me like i must be lost . that quickly changed , but i found it funny . that seems to be a vegas prerequisite ... act like the shoppers ca n't afford to shop in hopes that they will prove themselves . i would have given a 5-star review based on the service we received after the initial walk-in , but i ca n't forget that look of disapproval . i was n't dressed up , do n't get me wrong , but i was n't toting a fanny pack either . my girlfriend was dressed up . we picked out and purchased a pair of heels that they had in-stock . we were on the fence about a pair of suede boots . the salespeople seemed happy as we walked out the door and asked us to come back soon ! little did they know ... immediately after we left , we decided to play a slot machine at the bellagio where we were staying . when it hit for $ 6,000 , we decided that we needed the boots also . i called the store and told them that we wanted them . they asked if we would be coming back to the store or if we would like them delivered to our room . delivery , of course . i kid you not , they beat us to the room ! by the time we got paid out on our machine and walked up to our room , the boots were sitting there with a thank you card . talk about great service ! in the end , we had a nice experience with this store and the staff . however , i realize that if i had not bought anything , i might not have felt the same way . as a frequent traveler and travel agent , i hate to think of my customers ( or visitors in general ) being treated poorly on vacation . maybe somebody will read this and will address it with the staff . you ca n't judge a book by it 's cover !
1	this is my favorite sushi restaurant in arizona . this is one of those hole-in-the-wall places . if you are looking for amazing ambiance , you wo n't find it here , but excellent food you will . have never had anything i did n't like here with either the rolls , or sashimi . the food is fresh and full of flavor . some of my favorites items here are the baked green mussels , spicy scallops , salmon sashimi , and las vegas roll . prices are really reasonable . if you 've never had fresh wasabi , give it a try , it 's now a must everytime i go somewhere .
0	nothing special . a bit overpriced for what you are getting , but what do you expect at a restaurant on the strip ? tater tots were okay , but i 've had better . beet salad was a winner .
1	i 've never stayed in the rooms at the mandalay bay resort & casino , but i hope to one of these days as this is one of my favorite casinos to visit while in las vegas . what i love is the many things to see and do here as well as awesome restaurants and fun shopping . i also like the easy access mandalay place mall that takes you to the luxor . mandalay bay is also the home to michael jackson one , the cirque show that i have not yet seen , but that everyone who i have talked to about it absolutely raves about how wonderful it is . some of my favorite things are the minus 5 ice bar and then the mall near that . i like that the house of blues has made it 's home here and i love rm seafood and fleur , some really delicious restaurants with great service . on my recent trip , i also hit up the shark reef aquarium , which was small , but nicely done . mandalay bay has a huge convention/events center and the one place i have n't been , but dream of hanging out at : the pool ! it looks so fun and i plan to spend some time there one of these days ! all of the staff there that i have interacted with have been super friendly and i 've actually won money here gambling before . i 've just never had a negative experience at the mandalay bay , so hopefully , i 'll one day also stay here and experience the hospitality and rooms !
0	clear has the worst service ever . it took several devices ( they tried to charge shipping each time ) for me to get a near working device ... ( ( rover puck ) ) and the other `` pocket '' device are horrible , the connections are horrible , especially when you are working on something important . so i stopped my service months ago , when i moved back to sf bay , where it stopped working ... and yet they are still trying to harass their way back into my wallet . non-stop calls , emails and the like ... you 'd be better off with something else ....
1	yum ! i love their vegetable broth and garnishes and everything ! great service ( fast ) and great food ! what more is there to say ?
0	i have been to great clips a number of different times and have always been satisfied but my visit there on thursday , 01/16/2014 , was the last time i will ever go there again ! ! ! ! ! it was at the great clips in the deer valley marketplace located at the corner of w. deer valley road & n. 83rd ave. in peoria . when i first got there one of the women looked my name up under my phone number and put me on the waiting list . then another woman called me up to the counter and asked for my name . i told her my name and she said it was n't there . then she asked for my phone number . i told her but i had to repeat it several times . she was very rude and was extremely hard to understand due to her accent . she said her name was nina ( later when i looked at the receipt it showed her name to be niculina ) . she directed me to a chair and asked me how i wanted my hair cut . i asked her if she could check the notes in the computer to see how it had been cut the last few times i had been in because i wanted it cut the same way . she walked over to the computer and looked at it for a few seconds and said `` something happened to computer , there 's nothing '' and walked back to the chair . i told her how i wanted it cut but she wanted to do it differently . i told her no to do it like i said . well after she cut my hair ( if you can call it that ) i asked her if she could rinse my hair off in the sink , not shampoo just rinse with water so i could get all the extra cut hair off and she said no she would have to charge me for a shampoo . so i asked if i could do it myself and she said no . then she immediately put gel in my hair without even asking if i wanted any in my hair . it was ok because i use gel in my hair anyway but i thought it was odd . well after i got home from having dinner i took a shower and my wife looked at me and said omg ! ! ! your hair ! ! ! go look at it ! '' it is really really bad ! i have bald spots in a number of places where my hair is cut all the way to the scalp ! how does someone do that ? ! then there are other places that have long hairs that she did not even cut ! to top it all off when i looked at my receipt she did n't even spell my name correctly , it reads brayen not brian ? ? ? i have e-mailed them and also called their corporate office and i am still waiting for them to call me back . the sad thing is i am job hunting and now i have hair that looks like a monkey cut it for bananas . i 'm not saying all the stylists there are bad but if you do go there just make sure you do not have niculina ( nina ) cut your hair .
0	i'vs shopped at this old navy many times . prior to march 1 , 2014 , my shopping experiences had been pleasant . the floor associates are very nice and really go the extra step to help customers choose the best fitting jeans . while i have always found the floor associates helpful , the cashiers are far less pleasant . my trip on march 1st was the most disturbing . the store was pretty busy because of the $ 15 sale on jeans . finding a floor associate that was n't helping another customer was impossible . i took my purchases to the counter and asked the cashier to check the stores inventory for a size 6 pants for my little girl . she said there were plenty on the shelf . i told her i looked repeatedly but was not able to find a pair . i suggested that the pants must have been on a shelf too high for me to reach . she then asked me if i wanted to pay for my items , then go back and try to reach the pants on my own then stand in line again to complete a second transaction . i told her i did not want to do that ... that i wanted her to have an associate get the pants for me ( seeing as i did not have a ladder ) and ring up all my items on a single transaction . with a very disapproving look , she said `` fine '' and stormed off . very unpleasant experience . would give five stars if not for the terrible check out service . my latest experience was extreme but the cashiers have always been less than friendly . i guess cashiers and floor associates receive different training . as a side note , the tiny clearance section allows only a few shoppers at a time . any more than that and you could start feeling claustrophobic .
0	hardly utopian for this beer fan . nice ambiance , on hip lower rue crescent , and a nice mix in the crowd . ordered the ipa on the recommendation of the very good bartender . what a disappointment -- virtually flavorless . not what i 'd expect of an ipa at all . probably should have tried something else , but i just moved on . oh , and like other independent brewpubs in montreal - cash only . boo for the business traveler .
1	yum ! ! ! i actually ordered cran-slam club ... it was good , but i did find the turkey a bit dry ... but my cousins ordered capastrami and the bobbie ... so of course i had to take a bite of their sandwiches ... the bobbie was soooo yummy ! ! ! ! having tasted my sandwich , i have to say that it 's the stuffing that makes the bobbie so yummy and not so dry ! ! ! ! and capastrami was also very good ! ! ! just found out there 's a capriottis in beverly hills ... i ca n't wait to go there and order the bobbie ! ! !
0	my rating is average because i believe this show is just average . it is just dancing , singing , a little audience interaction , but mostly nothin too special about h madison . the real credit goes to the back up singers , the diva dj of the house and the male singer . man can they sing . i was a little tired going into this show and coming off ka which is impressive by the way but i take each show with a fresh perspective and this show was just , well not worth the money . maybe for 20 a head instead of 65 or 95 or 125 ... i mean anyone can see girls dancing topless to music and colorful lights but over all it was nothing special . h madison barely does n't do anything . i think she is just there to sell her name to the show , no offense . she is freaking gorgeous . dp
0	disappointing meal here tonight , had a seafood platter . fish and shrimp were fried in semi-rancid oil . you have to change your oil occasionally ! also nothing to dry your hands in mens room - no air dryer , paper towel was completely out . i expect waaay more for the prices you pay here .
0	i do n't know why i keep coming here . the service is not good and their food is n't good . and they are n't even busy ! i 've been here about 6 times . mostly take out and one dine in occasion . i 've never had one of those experiences where i notice someone order after me and still get their food first . until here ! i remember that occasion . we ordered a pizza , and two appetizers . our pizza came out literally 45 minutes after ordering it , they bring the one appetizer another 5 minutes later , and then the second appetizer just about the hour mark . one of those that 's it i 'm leaving moments but i stuck it out . we were in there when there were maybe 2 other small parties were there so i just did n't understand . they had a lot of workers but we maybe got one refill when we asked after we ate . there was never a `` sorry out kitchens baked up '' or even a just plain `` sorry it 's taking so long '' . that tells me they do n't see a problem . how hard is it to fry up some garlic balls to bring out as an appetizer ? how about wings ? that should have come out first to freaking offset the pizza wait ! restaurant and service 101 ! our entire meal took almost an hour and a half . granted the take out line started getting busy we still ordered way before it got busy . then tonight i went and took a take out order and our crust was burnt on our pizza . sorry but that was the last straw . i just ca n't see myself eating here again . yes their garlic balls are good and cheap but i 'll go elsewhere at all costs . their ordering sucks . you call and automatically get placed on hold . why ? ! i was in there and both girls did that . why ? ! they were n't even doing anything that could n't wait ! also the staff sucks . customer service and personality go along way . i do n't see how that girl works there . she must be related or own the place . dark hairs girl that is a little pale . sorry to put her out there but she just sucks . one time she gave me a free ranch with my order but i left a tip larger than the cost of the ranch so that does n't make up for it . there 's no appreciation of the customer . i 'd rather eat where they have good service and good food as opposed to bad service and great food . they do n't give a good name to local businesses and i 'd much rather eat at a big corporate chain as opposed to this place .
0	for take out pizza it was not bad ! ! have so many to choose from have never tried papa johns before ! so took a chance , it was hot and came with extras ! will i order again maybe but am going to try others since i 'm new to this area !
0	the staff is really awesome , and i grew up by an arcade so it definitley takes me back . however on a busy night this place is clearly a spot for bad parents to go out and drink while their 8 kids run around , one ran into me and i spilled some of my drink . i 'd say go to this place on a school night .
0	not at all what was expected . the website leads you to believe bit is a gourmet bakery and breakfast place , when in reality it is a run of the mill mediocre sandwich shop .
0	dropped in here during phoenix comicon and ended up coming back every day i was there . location can hardly be beat . the wait staff was very friendly and helpful , probably one of the best parts of eating at kokoro , actually . whoever did their interior design really knew what they were doing . the place really has a great feel to it . i went with a friend , and we focused more on the dinner items and less on the sushi , so i can only speak to that . katsudon was great . they added a bit of kick to it for a southwestern touch , which turned out really well . their salmon teriyaki was great considering the price . my friend ordered their fried rice , and liked it so much that he kept ordering it three days in a row . my friend also tried the tempura , which he said was a bit sub-par , but considering the price , well worth it . their `` dinner '' items come with miso soup and a salad as well . salad is , to be honest , rather plain , but it 's nice that they include it considering how inexpensive the dinner sets are . the miso soup was a bit salty for my taste , but still good . i would not recommend the spicy korean beef steak . in all honesty , the katsudon had more kick to it , and the flavor of the korean beef was fairly weak . overall , eating here was a great experience . the food , on average , is a great deal . prices are fairly low , especially considering their prime location in the heart of downtown . in general , you get more than you pay for here , but do n't expect it to be the best in the city . for good food on the cheap , in the heart of downtown phoenix , i would recommend kokoro , although not necessarily my first choice . update : went back twice since i was in town again . had some trouble with the service .... during lunch the line was huge , and during dinner it was so packed that they were too busy to take my order . i ended up going somewhere else . hopefully that 's not a trend but ... i should also comment on the chicken teriyaki . it really was n't any good . try ordering something else .
1	they 're in ndg now ! imagine the glee when we learned that ta was bringing its pies to monkland ave / girouard ! villa maria is the closest metro stop so far the pies we 've had ( as take-out ) are : steak bacon cheese . verdict = delicious butter chicken . verdict = oh , yummy ! spinach , mushroom , tomato & ricotta . verdict = vegetarian pies , although tasty and possibly healthy are not the thing of which legends are made . ned kelly . verdict = omg omg omg ! while you can easily imagine the first three pies flavour profile you 're going to have to try the ned kelly . it 's a steak pie , with fried egg and cheese and bbq sauce all in one magical eye-popping pie ! serve any of these pies ( except for the vile veggie one ) alongside some mushy peas , mashed potatoes and and a cold one and you 're golden . they 've got big pies to take home and they have little pies that you can eat while you 're taking your big pie home . they 've really thought of everything .
0	red , white & blue restaurant is a lunch and dinner sit-down restaurant in the mandalay bay ( next to fleur by hubert keller ) . the restaurant feels like a more contemporary version of a traditional american restaurant . the restaurant 's straightforward and kind of old-school decor ( as well as the loud atmosphere ) reminds me of a daily grill . the restaurant ( at least for lunch ) features mainly classic dishes like buffalo wings , reuben sandwich , pastrami sandwich , spaghetti and meatballs , tuna salad sandwich , and so on . the menu and the prices felt similar to a lot of the 24 hour vegas cafes though i found my experience at red , white & blue a little better . i had the seared ahi tuna , which was served with wasabi mashed potatoes and a citrus sauce , but i opted for the green beans instead of the potatoes . the ahi tuna was decent . it was served rare and was pretty fresh . the citrus sauce was flavorful and light . the green beans were cooked properly . nice crispness to them and also fresh . there were also some pickled onions and asparagus on the plate and both were fine and added flavor . my friend 's lobster cobb salad was huge and it did not look that great . i do n't think she was that impressed with it . both dishes came with pretty generous portions . service was good . the waitress was friendly and attentive . like other vegas restaurants , this place was overpriced . sandwiches were in the $ 13- $ 17 range while entrees were in the mid- $ 20s . i 've definitely had better food at the same prices , but i 've also definitely had worse food in vegas at those prices . there are plenty of mid-range priced restaurants available at mandalay bay ( like burger bar , which is okay , and border grill -- i have n't been there ) . because of that , you may be able to find a better meal at the same price around here . still , red , white & blue was better than i expected and i would n't swear off coming here again under the right circumstances . parking is complimentary ( both valet and parking structure ) .
1	decent selection , fair prices , but could use more folks at the checkout lanes , or at least a process whereby they call up more employees to help out quicker .
0	came here for brunch . i tried a lot of food but none seems to stand out . although the heirloom tomato salad with mozz cheese tasted fresh , firm and well balanced . i liked the availability of the quince paste , cheese and cold cuts . the kale salad was too vinegary and killed the kale . had a shredded beef eggs benedict and thought the hollandaise had no life . the watermelon sriracha was interesting . not impressed as of now but they have the resources to be much better .
1	great selection of toppings and yogurt ! super clean friendly atmosphere the only place i will get yogurt from . do yourself a favor and go get some !
1	absolutely love this place ! ! ! ! i would ( and have ) recommended many people here for the best airbrush tan . donna is all around great - she always recommends the best color for you , makes you feel comfortable , and gets you in and out . the price is perfect and there are even deals ! this is definitely my go-to when i need extra color for an event . i would never go anywhere else !
1	decent taiwanese cafe for homemade noodles and xlb . a little farther to drive outside of chinatown , but definitely was n't disappointed . the mamasans who own and run the restaurant are really cute , i got really good service and the food was really yummy . i ordered the beef chow mien , soup dumplings ( xlb ) , and the layered pancake which is one of my all time favorite appetizers . they make it really crispy and light , not too oily . it 's delicious and i 'd probably come back just for that . the beef chow mien was also a treat , mostly because of the homemade noodles with a really good firm texture . the xlb is definitely worth ordering and i think is the best in vegas . they give you a lot of food too , i was n't able to finish because everything was so good !
1	general feel : this location is great . it is relatively new and offers a fast drive-thru and sparkling new interior . same affordable and quality tasting meals that makes me love the panda express brand . customer service : two employees i 've noticed , susana - she is extremely welcoming and genuine , it is always nice to see her , and nancy - i appreciate her efficiency at taking orders and serving guests , on busy days she keeps the line moving fast . there is one girl i will remain nameless , let 's call her lipstick , is a bit .... how to put it ... it seems as every day is her first day on the job . which is a bit frustrating when you see her every time . tip : fill out the easy survey ( online or by phone ) on the back of your receipt and receive a free entree with your next purchase of a two-entree plate . i love giving positive feedback ! it 's easy for people to criticize , i like to recognize whats good : )
1	i love you trader joe 's . no , you are not `` my '' grocery store . i ca n't commit to you as my one and only baby . it 's not you , it 's me . i am tempted by the fruit of another . sprouts and sunflower produce trumps you baby , but do n't you worry your pretty head about it . you 've got my favorite cheese selection and you know how i am about cheese . you know no matter how many times i stray , i 'll always come back to you . you do n't need to worry about the items i buy at safeway baby , that 's different . that 's just shopping . what we have is something more than that . i love it whenever i discover something new about you . i ca n't live without your hummus or your mediterranean style yogurt . it reminds me of crisp mornings in the amphora hotel in chania harbor . of course the honey here will never be as magical as it was in greece but that 's not your fault dear . i love that you know i 'm not made of money . i do n't have to flash a lot of brass to impress you and that always makes me feel accepted and appreciated . even when you 're cold , or feeling like you ca n't give me the things i want ( because let 's face it you 're * always * out of stock on something i really like ) i can always find something to make me feel like our time together is special and well worth the effort . it might be another week or so until our next visit baby , but you know you 're gon na be on my mind and when i hunger for something only you can provide , you know i 'll be back . i always come back .
0	we were craving pho after tao but too lazy to head off the strip so we came here instead . surprisingly , they had their own version of pho called zen noodles . it was like a `` fancy looking '' pho , the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving , although really not worth $ 14 . the primary reason i 'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible . we got there around 3 am , which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately . after we gave our order though , we had to wait an eternity to get our food . it was like that for all the tables next to us too . our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour . i get that it 's busy but i ca n't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table . in total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 - 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting ( for our food , for the bill , for them to take our credit card ... ) . if you 're looking for a place to grub after clubbing , i 'd recommend going someplace else like earl of sandwich instead . you can get a great tasting meal in a few minutes and for half the price .
0	the summerlin dance academy in las vegas is not for anyone that wants to be a professional dancer . the instructors that the school has , currently , have poor qualifications , the parents are vulgar ( while waiting for children and while attending the recital ) , and the director of the school only has administrative experience and zero dance experience or perspective . the only good thing about the school is that they dress the kids well , at the recital , so that when the children to not improve their dance skills , nor learn noted techniques , they at least look cute and impress low-expectant parents . for best results , please find a qualified private dance teacher or a better and more classical dance institution , for your child .
0	i had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here . i had been to johnny rocket 's before and gotten the vegan option so i knew i would be ok going here . i was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so i figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want . we get in and i ordered a burger that was n't the streamliner ( 1st mistake ) , and just ordered it with the boca burger . the waitress takes our order , my husband also ordered his with a boca . about 20 minutes later the food comes out . the patty looks right . i was a little apprehensive and i should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day , but i ignored it . it had been awhile since i had eaten a boca patty ( over a year ) , so i thought it looked right . ( 2nd mistake ) i start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table . it was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there . so i look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say turkey substitution . i immediately start to freak out . we call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered boca , why does it say turkey ? she then tells us that it is boca it just says turkey . i say , no that does n't sound right . so she goes to talk to her manager i guess because we never saw her again . the manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened . i 'm upset because how the hell do you confuse boca and turkey ? i mean , really . i know some people might think how did i not know the difference . and i thought that to myself as well , but the truth is it slipped by me even though it should n't have . and it hurts me every time i think about it . i will never come to this johnny rockets again , if any of them ever again because of this experience . all i can say is , if you are vegan or vegetarian , and you go to any of the johnny rockets , make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a boca burger is n't meat . stress that to them . because obviously they are n't trained to know what the difference is .
0	it 's cheap , i 'll say that , but otherwise it 's bland food served by workers who mostly do n't seem to notice they 're working , and when they do , only respond snarkily . there are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from .
1	i write this quick review as i sit in the parking lot trying to not tear open my container , because it smells so good ! food is fresh so fresh you might have to wait for certain meats but , its definitely worth the wait i came at a good time so i avoided `` the line '' which came shortly after i placed my order .. the inside can get a little cramped but orders move out pretty fast . i 'm sure i 'll be back just judging off the smell i ordered the 2 meat combo tip/brisket mnc & baked beans i had to have a quick taste of a rib tip ... i can no longer say vegas does n't have a good place for bbq perfect flavor and tenderness
0	i was given the bate and switch routine that sleazy car dealers are known for and i would never recommend cardinaleway mazda peoria az to anyone
1	this place is amazing . my friends and i had the best meal we 've ever eaten , here . we received great service , as well , including a table visit from the executive chef . this is , by far , the best steak place we 've ever eaten . if you go to vegas , do not miss this place .
1	one of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday . it was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff , as they clapped their hands ( and probably rolled their eyes ) , sang happy birthday , and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle . my twins just turned 5 and i wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar . so , i started to look for places that would sing happy birthday . apparently , this is yet another thing to file in the `` good old days '' category . supposedly my big fat greek restaurant sings happy birthday in greek ... which sounds interesting , unless you are a 5 year old . rustler 's rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday ! however , for a $ 15 price tag . but ! you also get a cowboy hat . i have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well , even if it is no longer free . the candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people . it is a football-sized eclair , oozing with whipped cream ( my favorite food ) , and drizzled with chocolate ( my second favorite food ) . as for the rest of the food .... it is okay . the meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad ( ice berg lettuce , cucumber , a few cherry tomatoes and croutons ) . i do appreciate getting food immediately , even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread . for the meal , i had the `` catch of the day '' which was ahi tuna . it was well seasoned , but it could have been more pink . i will say the exact same thing about my husband 's steak . the kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge ; i think it was the largest portion size among the entire table . i was relieved i opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side . but this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience . it is a place you go for a fun-dining experience . there is a slide that all the kids love ... and maybe some adults ( * cough * ) enjoy it as well . there is also a big cow that greets you at the entrance . does it emit a smell that i want to smell right before eating ? probably not . but i will give it a few points for having such large , curly horns .
0	this was a huge let down ! ! it 's in terrible need of a major cleaning which made me wonder how dirty the kitchen and prep areas were ! ! we will not be going here again
0	dirty tables , soiled floors , and bad food . according to a dated publication posted on the restaurant 's wall , it was the owner 's long time dream to open a restaurant . the publication shocks me for two reasons : the restaurant is dirty and the food is awful ... that does n't feel dreamy to me . i ordered the sliders . the wife ordered a turkey club sandwich . safe bets considering this is our first visit . it was hard to find an open table and that 's not because the restaurant was busy ( at the top of the lunch hour , we were the only patrons ) ... we could n't find a clean table . i guess the dream did n't factor in employees who would rather drink lattes and watch football games than clean tables and floors . then came the food . the sliders were clumsily made , the onion straws were cold , and the mac n ' cheese was unseasoned and bland . my wife 's sandwich was mediocre and elementary ( in my lazy college days , i made better sandwiches with half the sobriety of the restaurant cooks ... granted i 'm making a big assumption ) . in short , save your money and spare yourself the nightmare ... find another spot .
1	wow this was some next level stuff . every dish is quality and a lot of them are world class and you get to choose which one ( s ) you want ! i actually loathe buffets but i would come back to this one again ! ! !
1	they never disappoint . solid place to go , never had a bad experience .
0	staff was great ... food was average at best . not much more to say ...
1	great food , incredible view , excellent service . what more could you ask for . we 've done the prix fix many times and just ordering off the regular menu is great too . ca n't go wrong for a special occasion dinner here .
1	ambiance is a 5 ! quiet and away from the bustle of e carson st. bdc occupies the ground floor of a renovated row house . tables are scattered over many rooms and an inviting outdoor deck . bdc serves inteligensia coffee ( like 21st street ) . oatmeal and gelato are also menu highlights .
0	very disappointed . ordered chicken pad thai to go and i did n't notice until i got home that they put tofu instead of chicken . the flavor was very plain , there was n't even peanuts in it . do n't recommend .
1	while i normally would shy away from anything called `` lube chips '' , cause , you know , it 's got the word `` lube '' in it . and imaging something like a `` lube chip '' in my 7th grade-like mind just does n't sound right . but they 're actually good . for that matter , the whole restaurant is good . plus they have a car mounted sideways on the wall . seriously . it 's solidly hung too . i checked . it 's not going anywhere . what i appreciate is unlike other wing-establishments of their kind , their sauce names actually line up to their heat . if you order a medium hot sauce , it 's not mild nor hot . their arizona ranch sauce is a spectacular mix of medium-ish sauce with ranch dressing . for entrees , i 'm a fan of the wrap and my wife has actually gotten the steak a couple of times . she was pleased . the adult beverages are reasonably priced and a good selection too . service has always been good for me . now i 'm thinking i am going to go there after work . see what writing this review has done for me ?
0	got together with a bunch of friends for dinner here tonight , & it was my first visit . the menu consists mostly of sandwiches with hamburger , fried fish , & big , expensive salads . i had a patty melt & fries , & while the seasoned fries were good , i thought the sandwich did n't compare with the same one at the place that invented it , norm 's restaurant in l.a. , where it costs less & has a big 1/2 lb . of tasty burger on it , along with the cheese & sauteed onions . the meat patty on this one was kind of dinky & dry , & the price , along with most everything else on the menu was about $ 10 , which struck me as high for what you get . the friends were great company , but i was n't impressed at all with the food here .
1	kind of a long drive from the heart of town but the casino is nice and clean . you wo n't smell like smoke when you leave . decent machines and dining options . the spa is nice . i am a local so i have never stayed in their rooms . the lattes from baby cakes are super . great sports book too .
0	i wish this update was for a bump up to 4 stars , unfortunately it is not . if i had written this friday night and they did n't offer good vegan options it could have easily been a 1 star review . the funny part of this saga is i had completely forgotten about my prior review which had to do with pizza heaven figuring out orders with different toppings , charges , etc . recently i have been complaining about how expensive z pizza has been getting , pizza heaven 's location is closer and i thought would be cheaper so here goes ; round two . the order : 3 topping large pizza with vegan cheese , on their menu listed for $ 17.50 . when i arrived to pick up the pie i was told `` that will be $ 27. ? ? `` what ? ! ? ! `` no , i just had a 3 topping pizza , just one ... nothing else '' . this is where the discussion began on how they charge for toppings , apparently their policy is to rip people off ? i think we all learned in the 4th grade ( ok maybe not ) if you put 3 toppings on one half and 3 toppings on the second half you have used the same amount of toppings for the pie - the toppings may be different yes , but the net amount of toppings used ( and might i add purchased by the establishment ) is still the same . since my girlfriend ca n't stand onions , and i hate those little black olives we each had our own side of 3 toppings each but ... get this .... were charged for 6 toppings ! recap : no more toppings were used total on the pizza but because they were all different apparently they have made it a policy to charge for 6 toppings . the vegan cheese was also an extra $ 2 but not listed on their menu online ( or at the restaurant ) . they ended up comping me for one topping and i did n't throw too much of a fight because i knew i would not be coming back anytime soon . once i got home and tried the pizza it did nothing more then seal the deal . it was n't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best . i do n't feel great about writing this review , i really want to love and support independent businesses in phoenix but when they have crazy policies like this and i have to spend $ 27+ to get a large mediocre pizza i need to draw the line somewhere . phoenix has very few vegan pizza options but right now it seems like the corporate giants win again - i can get a large surfboard vegan pizza at whole foods , with any 3 toppings on any half , which tastes great for $ 15.99 ; no hassles . lastly i would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though i was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled . even when i left she was still very friendly , it 's safe to say she saved this from being a one star review , kudos to you .
1	my friend who lives in arizona does not hold this place in high regard but i 'm giving it four-stars for the food alone . i ordered the clams and calamari appetizers . the clams arrived sprinkled liberally with fresh tomato and herbs and were gorgeous . the calamari was crispy and not chewy . both came with excellent dipping sauces and focaccia bread . that alone was a heck of a lot of food . the clams in particular rocked my world . for a main dish , i ordered the highest price item on the menu , the swordfish with pesto sauce ( $ 18.95 ) . my companion complained that the swordfish was overcooked but i did not feel this to be the case . it was , after all , grilled and not steamed or baked . the taste was incredible , as was the lemon rice and grilled asparagus which came with the dish and the zesty pesto sauce . loved it ! i was not thrilled at all with the service . college guy kept trying to take our plates before we were finished with the dishes . multiple times . multiple people tried to do the same things , such as bus dishes and bring menus . i would have been much happier with one patient waiter . awesome food . service could have been better . i will go back for sure .
0	well i do hate leaving a bad review on a place with such nice staff and warm and friendly owner but unfortunately a restaurant needs to be more than just a bunch friendly nice people . the quality of the food has got to follow . as much as i really wanted to like the food and was hoping that this place could be a good alternative to firefly , it just was not . overall the food was bland , low quality ingredients and clearly nothing is homemade . the worst were the meatballs , avoid them at all costs . they were hard as a rock and no taste . clearly pre-maid , frozen and re-heated in the microwave ( i am single , i know what those taste like ! ) . second to worst was the manchego and bacon mac & cheese . i had this before in other tapas places and it is a party in your mouth . this one was bland and floury . not sure how they screwed this one up . also as one would expect portions are small , it is a tapas place . i have no issue with small portion but it needs to burst with flavor . on a good note , the bacon wrapped dates are good . do n't think i will be going back but if i do , i will stick to the sangria and the dates .
1	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ... cut ! we shared the corn salad starter . now , corn salad sounds so terribly unappealing to me - but it was the one salad the three of us could agree on . so so so so good ! mmmmm .. corn salad ! and then the bread tray . i heart bread trays . we sampled all the bread but my heart and my taste buds have pledged allegiance to the fresh baked , soft , doughy , salty pretzel bread . the best thing ever . so good . the nice waiter actually put six of the pretzels in a container for us - which we snacked on the entire next day - just because we could n't stop gushing about them . there was a small cheese-puff amuse bouche that came out after the salad . it was yummy . for my main course i had the filet mignon , cooked to perfection . seriously . perfect . delicious . wow . i mean ... wow ! what a great steak . while we each ordered sauce - i had the bearnaise ( yum ) , my friend had the horseradish ( good ) and my sister had the steak sauce ( a bit sweet for me ) - we truly did n't need it ... what your server does n't tell you is that they will bring out various mustards - lavender , etc - and that the mustards are just as good as - if not better than - the sauces . service was impeccable . attentive but not in your face . my cocktail was okay . i think it was called a hemingway . it did n't blow me away . neither did the mille-feuille the three of us shared ... it was okay , not great . a let down , actually . the cream was delicious but a mille-feuille translates - literally - into a thousand sheets . as in `` lots of pastry . '' and this had maybe 5 sheets . maybe not . i would have skipped the dessert and gone somewhere else . finally , the sides were a mixed back . the creamed spinach was good , but not great . the yukon potato puree was tasteless ... the peppers and mushrooms were deeeeelish . please , do everyone a favor and order them . mmmmm . so , 5 stars for theservice , the meat , the bread and the salad . 4 stars for the sauces . 3 stars for the cocktails and sides . 2 stars for the dessert . 4 stars overall ... i 'll be back , but i still prefer craftsteak and nero .
0	never go here ! i was denied being sold alcohol because they assumed i had been drinking because i mentioned that i had just left a club , where i had gone to line dance . please keep in mind it was 10:00pm on a saturday night , they would n't even sell me fruit ! ! ! !
1	the pizza here is n't great , but compared to other `` cheap '' pizza places it 's pretty tasty . i mean the crust , cheese , sauce , and toppings actually taste like those things , which might sound like a no-brainer , but with real cheap pizza you never know what it 's gon na taste like . i 've always gotten the two 14 '' pizza deal w/two toppings ( on each pizza ) for $ 16 ( it actually used to be $ 14.99 ) with my family . that 's a pretty good deal imo ( and like i said , the pizza is actually pretty good ) . i will say , i thought it was odd the last time i ordered from here i was quoted a price that seemed high to me over the phone . i mentioned it when i went in to pick up & was told you had to mention over the phone when ordering the `` deal . '' i mean , they gave it to me , but still thought it was odd i had to mention it . all in all , this place has pretty solid cheap pizza . i also believe they serve by the slice even tough it 's not on display ( maybe at certain times it is ) , and i noticed when you check on on foursquare you can get a free slice w/purchase . cool beans . oliveo does have some seating , but not much so carryout or delivery are your best options .
1	by far the best swedish massage i 've ever had . they get pretty close to your lady parts and you ca n't be shy , they 're gon na stay with you in the room as you undress ( i guess you could request they step out for a second ) but man jenny rubbed all the crap out of my muscles , i left feeling loose as a noodle . the rest of the spa is included in the cost of the massage , but i 'd save my money if you want to go for just that .
0	service needs some improvement.sushi was terrible ! lacked freshness and most of all flavor ... they tasted the same or it was blasted with spice so you could not savor ask the different flavors . i eat sushi regularly .... know good and promise me .. save you 're monies and go elsewhere . if you 're an experienced sushi eater you will be disappointed
0	went there again last night for the burger . supposed to come out on toasted buns , it did n't . medium , was medium rare . and once again i was almost ignored by the waitress , and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done . and the noise , so noisy , could n't really carry on a conversation . i wo n't be back .
1	my husband and i went on a whim following bar rescue . this place is awesome ! the decor is wonderful , staff was cool , drinks were fun ... but the food ! omg it was incredible ! i typically do n't go to bars for food , but the appetizer and pizza were out of this world ! i did n't want the spam pizza to begin with , now i am not sure i would order anything else ! it flavored it more like a prosciutto would . the crust is a must for any new yorker missing home . it was flexible so you could fold it but it had the perfect crunch factor as well . i was most impressed with the cleanliness of the kitchen . it looked like a laboratory or hospital ; it was so clean . the level of the music never went over 90 db making for easy conversation at the bar . the dj even played our request immediately . very happy with this place , will make it a stop on our future visits . busiest at 6 and again at 11pm . we made it there at 9 on a thursday and had the place to ourselves . costs : only $ 8 cab ride from gold coast , palms and orleans $ 65 got the 2 of us plenty fed with app , pizza and 9 drinks
0	nice decor , mediocre food . shrimp tacos should not be served in a deep fried corn tortilla with two small shrimp each . rip off comes to mind . excessive raw garlic in the black beans made them inedible , and i love garlic . the ceviche was just weird -- 6 '' strips of fish that were very difficult to maneuver . i tried cutting it to a manageable size in the serving bowl and wound up spilling it all over the table . and it was ridiculously expensive . by the way , restaurant 101 tells you appetizers are to be served before the entrees . all courses came out together . unless they change their menu and techniques , we can expect this experiment to be short lived .
0	auto unlimited is the worst car dealership i have ever had to deal with . they break the law and the owner is a terrible person . i bought a car that pulled to the right , during the purchase i told the salesman that i would not buy the car if it pulls to the right . so he assured me that they would take care of it . after they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit i am not helping you . the car also has a dtc for a sensor that came on 2 days after i bought the car . i checked and they cleared the code right before i bought the car . that is against the law ! ! never ever go to this dealership , they lie just to get you to buy a car .
0	it was terrible , terrible , terrible . the lady preparing the bagel for my daughter could n't even make a straight cut , the peanut-butter and jelly was all over the place . how hard is it to prepare an appealing peanut-butter and jelly bagel ? ? ? ? the end result looked like she just threw up all over it . my bagel was n't fresh and when she pulled out the humus , it had a crust on it like an old product would have . it was one of the most terrible sunday breakfasts i 've ever had . i will never ever return !
0	tessie ( tessy ? ) was our server , and she pretty much ignored us , fun . the onion rings were good , a light crispy batter with thinly cut onion . nice . the pulled pork sandwiches were pretty unexciting . mine was on the dry side , and my dining partner says that she did not get enough sauce . further , yjr sweet heat sauce does n't have a lot of flavor , only heat . their mac n cheese had corn in it . do n't get me wrong , i like corn , but i do not eat gmo corn and not telling me that corn is in a dish is not cool .
0	i 'm going to agree with my friend , shawn j. i am old enough to remember when thirty ice cream was located in the now defunct thrifty drug stores . it was a `` loss leader '' charging 5 cents for a single , 10 cents , for a double , and 15 cents for a tripple . the quality was really low back then , but so were the prices . now , i did not expect to find the same prices , but for the poor quality , i did expect it to be less then 31 flavors , and cold stone . not the case . this ice cream is not in the same class with ben & jerry 's , hagen daz , 31 flavors , or even the bryer 's you get at the store . the scoops are generous , but the low quality does not justify their prices . my wife and i shared a double waffle cone of coffee and strawberry ice cream . a real waste of `` cheat '' calories on my diet . my suggestion ; go up or down the street to albertson 's or von 's , spend $ 4 on a pint of b & js , hagen daz , or something you really like , and go home and enjoy it . your taste buds and your wallet will both thank you .
0	we tried this place on a whim today and our experience was mixed . the tofu summer rolls were good but not great , the lemongrass soup was stellar , and my pad se ew was good but a bit too sweet . my husband 's experience was bad enough that we probably wo n't go back , unfortunately . my husband hates coconut and ordered the penang curry on the understanding that it was not prepared with coconut milk . unfortunately , our very nice server was wrong ( the dish was tasty but for the coconut ) . my husband exchanged his dish for the pad thai but that dish was very sweet with a hot pepper kick . overall , curry on murray gets a thumbs up for decor and service but the food is merely ok .
1	it was huge and had a cool feel . they played really awesome music and it was n't too crowded . it did a bit crowded but i really like that it 's connected to the playboy club so that we are able to hang out there when we are tired of the larger crowd . it 's a true vegas experience .
1	my favorite indian restaurant in madison ! delicious !
0	this has to be some of the worst sushi and burgers i have had in a very long time . sushi was loaded with rice and not very flavorful . burger tasted like a frozen patty and again lacked character and flavor
1	this is my hometown airport so it 's hard to write a bad review ( you know , local pride and all that ) . i fly in and out of mccarran a lot . it 's a serviceable airport with fairly easy parking and decent services . it 's an older airport so it shows its age , but since vegas attracts tourists from all walks of life from all over the world , it 's a great place to people watch between flights . my favorite is to watch when people get off a plane from , say , newark , and then they head straight for the in-airport slot machines . only in vegas . the new terminal 3 wing is super nice and shiny but lacks adequate seating ( and the security lines can be ridiculously long ) . if you are traveling out of terminal 3 you need to allow at least 30 more minutes than you think you need .
1	sure am glad they built this place . much cleaner than the chevron and it was way to busy anyways . southern highlands is a large community with not enough gas stations .
0	went for breakfast and the food was tasty . the service was just average . the eggs benedict were tasty but very salty without a lot of character . the egg white and veggie omelette was ok but nothing spectacular . the dining room is clean , large and fun . i would go back but the food is nothing spectacular .
0	i read some of the reviews and it looks like service is still a huge problem . hubby and i stopped in to watch the ncaa final 4 game while having dinner . we found a table and waited a few minutes until someone came by to get our drink order . we 're non-drinkers and when we asked for tea , our waitress gave us that look that we 're used to seeing . i wanted to tell her to not judge us because we do n't drink . we 're good tippers ( having spent a combined 20+ years in the restaurant biz ) . i knew immediately we were going to be in for a bad evening and i was right . she brought our drinks , took our order and we did n't see her again until we were finished eating . we could have used some ketchup , mustard and a little more salad dressing ... along with more iced tea but why bother , right ? i sat facing the whole bar and watched while one of the waitresses busted her butt for 6 large tables in one section as well as a couple of other tables near where we were sitting . our waitress , on the other hand , hung out by the service area at the bar with no other tables under her watch . i have no idea why she took us when she was serving the bar on the other side of the restaurant . suffice to say the meal was meh . we left before the game was over because the waitress put our check down and said , `` need anything else ? '' as she put the bill down and walked away . sad stuff because i know we could have gone elsewhere and had fantastic service . i wish we had . we wo n't be back when we 're back in scottsdale . we probably would have had better service at a fast food joint .
1	the cleanest , brightest , best stocked marshalls this outlet shopper has ever experienced . it 's quiet and organized inside , a big contrast to the ross next door . highly recommend if you 're on vacay and forgot something at home .... big enough to occupy a beat the heat moment from your trek along the strip .
1	i do really like this place . the music is better than the majority of the other old town clubs and it 's just a fun atmosphere . the dj 's they have are very nice . pretty much every time i 've come here , i 've had a good time . the only recommendation i have is do not arrive when it is approaching after-hours . you will stand in line forever while ( i think ) the bars are clearing out the liquor and such .. it becomes 18+ at this point which is so wack in my opinion . plus my feet were killing me standing there for so long waiting for the place to open back up . the after-hours is not at all a club atmosphere . the music is turned down very low , and it 's more like a sober-up-before-you-go home destination . but get there around 11:30pm or midnight and you 'll have a blast . : )
1	my wife and i heard about this restaurant/bar through a friend and we were not disappointed . the food is great , the people are friendly and the prices you ca n't beat . we 've been there three times since hearing about it and we will continue to stop by .
1	just like its original sister restaurant in elizabeth , this second location for crisp offers the same menu of fresh made salads , soups , and sandwiches , prepared to order as you wait . when looking for something on the lighter side , crisp remains an excellent option . the new location sports the same modern feel with muted tones of green and brown throughout the space , along with wooden vine accents neatly tucked into a few places . as with the original , you walk in the door here and go right to the counter to order , where you can watch your salad come together in less than two minutes . specials of the day are prominently posted and many are worth a try . for orders that require a bout more prep , servers will bring your order to your table . servers will also clear your table for you once you leave . tipping is actively encouraged , though you will still need to get your own drink and refills . prices here appear unchanged , and remain just a tad high , in my opinion , for what you get . still , there is no arguing with the freshness and emphasis on quality vegetables , fruits and nuts to enhance the dish . certainly makes the burrito and burger shops look like that fat slob of a cousin you only claim on holidays . you , meanwhile , can run around lean and trim , knowing you did n't kill your calorie count for the day over a single meal .
0	i was not impressed . bad food and bad service . the price was out of the question for this place . i will never return . i suggest pacific sea food for the same price .
0	three stars sums this place up . food is average . bar is average . the massive amount of tvs is average . i could step outside and head to the sportsbook and maybe my drinks would be cheaper there .
1	while my car was being serviced i decided to pop in to dori 's to check it out . i ordered a blueberry muffin and it was awesome ! the guy at the counter was super friendly and offered to warm it up for me . fast forward a few hours later and my car was still being serviced so i called my husband to pick me up . it was around lunch time and we were going to get sandwiches from subway but decided to walk down to dori 's to try them out . best decision ever ! the bread was so tasty and the ingredients were fresh ( i had a turkey avocado and hubby had the chicken bleu cheese ) . the french bread was most definitely the best i have ever had ; a little crusty on the on the outside but freaking soft in the middle ! we both ordered the potato salad which is homemade and not the stuff that comes from the tub . it was so good that we will definitely be back ! oh , i forgot the red velvet cupcake . the frosting was very creamy and the cake was moist and delicious . for 99 cents you can not go wrong : )
1	this place is much better than the restaurants that were in its place before . first of all , the complimentary chips come with 3 dips- 1 red salsa ( roasted chipotle i believe ) , 1 green salsa ( avocado and tomatillo- my fave ! ) , and a simple bean dip . all three are delicious ! i could have just that and a margarita and be set . i ordered the chicken flautas with a side of guacamole . the guacamole was simple ( i hate when restaurants try to throw too much in there ) and the flautas were crispy without being over done . i drank a regular margarita and then i went ahead tried a coconut lime margarita since it sounded intriguing . i was surprised at how good it was ! not too sweet , but not bland either . surprisingly delicious ! i ate in the bar area and the food came out quickly . the service and prices were great !
1	my first visit to the mandarin oriental , it is my new favorite vegas hotel . ( sorry , encore , i do love you , but m.o . is wonderful ! ) . elegant , first-class service and the perfect hideaway right in the middle of the city center ! once you enter the hotel , you feel `` elevated '' ( and not just because you must take an elevator up to the main lobby ) . i mean `` elevated '' as in `` treated with respect . '' customer service is top-notch . the hotel interior is dreamy-beautiful and you won ; t want to leave ! truly , you feel as if you have escaped the crazy roller coster ride of las vegas for luxe comfort and relaxation . you must go to their bar , perched high above the strip . commanding views of the lights and the hustle-bustle down on the street . order an exotic cocktail and dress glamorously ! i did not dine in the restaurant as i had other commitments ( boo-hoo ) , but i did have a fabulous massage in their spa . i scheduled a massage after check-out and then enjoyed a final view of the cityscape from the whirlpool . ( it does n't get any better than this ! ) they knew my flight was taking off shortly , so afterwards they whisked me down to their town car and off to the airport . yes , i am now a fan : )
0	i do n't understand why they act so unfriendly and provide such loose deadlines . two weeks was what i was informed that it would take to fix my unit . i followed up after 9 days and was told now it will be three weeks and they have n't even started working on it .
0	small rooms w/ small beds , walls are extremely thin , no wonder it 's cheap , you really get what you pay for , will never stay here again .
1	overall , it 's the best deli in vegas . huge portions , fresh ingredients , courteous and efficient staff , and reasonable prices . open faced reuben is a fantastic meal sure to promise a full second meal 's worth of leftovers , although it 's not a perfect `` reuben '' sandwich per say . i 've never been a huge fan of eating chicken salad sandwich 's from restaurants , but their 's is outright amazing and is in my usual rotation . matzah ball chicken noodle soup is always the highlight of the meal for me , and i always get an order to go whenever i start to feel sick ; it 's the closest thing to `` mom 's '' you 'll ever get . for breakfast , it 's always hard for me to try anything other than the `` ceily 's stack '' , it 's savory breakfast heaven with massive latkes and meat covered in cheese and gravy . has a nice family diner atmosphere , and service is definitely focused on efficiently turning customers over quickly ; which feels nice when your from the midwest or east coast like i am . get in , be smiled at , eat , get a refill , finish eating , and then leave . the way it should be ; no lollygagging around with laptops out or any of that nonsense .
0	i thought i saw how awesome these sanwhiches were on the travel channel . i ordered the # 2. it was very bland . burger was dry and fries had almost no taste . i never add salt to my meals but this one needed it . it was n't until later that i found out that the pastrami was the one to order . good service great prices and pitt atmosphere .
1	five star venue . reminds me of big city digs in l.a. or nyc . the runway . oh , i so wanted to strut my butt . but i decided to nibble on the delicious appetizers like corn cakes with avocado salsa and the yummy mini croque monseurs . the strawberry martini , although a bit too minty , was fruity and dry . like my `` funny '' cousin jim , who 's 47 single , likes wicker and has an `` i heart cats and books t'shirt . well , what do ya do ? service at our yelp event was great i thought . kristy had quite a few folks to sling drinks at and she was polite and professional . the menu seemed slightly inventive , with a $ 30 lobster sandwich , a spin on a cobb salad and the now obligatory sliders . i will be back for a visit and will definitely talk it up . next time , however , i will be ready with stilletos and my victoria secret angel wings !
0	i agree from christopher b . 's review ~ buyer beware and never go to this place ! ! i have a great place that i will recommend ( read my review about portrait innovations ) , however , i 've been here twice and it got worse every visit . the first visit was for my maternity photos because my friend recommended this place ( her photos are great ) however mine was not . the service was so-so , the sales person was that wanted to sell but she did take more than 30 shots . when i received my photos they were all dark and we blended in the background but the proofs were completely the opposite . ok so i let it go trying to give them benefit of the doubt . second time was more than a year later for my son 's 1st birthday photos . this was really bad ~ the sales person is different from the last time and she was rudest person . she rushed the pictorial and would n't allow a family shot because `` per company policy '' can only take 12-15 shots . bogus ! ! i bought the simplest package . she does not deserve a sale !
1	another great las vegas hotel and casino located on las vegas strip on the corner directly accross from the mgm grand hotel and casino . my check-in and check-out went without a hitch . the hotel is well maintained , has alot to offer and is centrally located . the pool areea is small , but , quite nice . i ate at the hotel 's gallaghers and the nine irish men , which were great restaurants . i would rate this on a par with planet hollywood , which is also within walking distance .
0	when a company refused to give out their list of ingredients and lies to the customer as to what is in the yogurt , it is called deceit . please be weary as this place does not use all natural ingredients and their sugar free flavors have tons of sugar in them . buyer beware
0	i heard they were very good at catering to food allergens , but we had a pretty poor experience . their gluten free menu was really limited compared to their normal menu . i have a soy intolerance , and they brought me crab in a soy wrapper . we did n't figure this out until i was a couple of bites in . then they did n't discount my meal . the waiter took forever even though the place was pretty empty . lame all around .
0	no reason to waste a meal here if you 're visiting montreal for a few days . it was n't bad , but it was n't all that good . the place was filled with tourists ( myself included ) and the service was understandably indifferent . felt like a wasted 2 hours .
1	great dive bar in tempe ! i 'd be hitting this place up much more if i lived in se valley . live music and games for all to play . i feel very comfortable here . do not come here for a view , quiet ambience , etc . come here to rock out/drink , or do a sunday funday day drink here . they are n't consistent with charging cover either . that 's okay though - more generous tipping later ! ; )
0	date/time : saturday - 7:30pm occasion : dinner with daddy and little brother party of : three location : typical chinese restaurant . simple decor . not the cleanest ordered : westlake beef soup , flamebroiled pepper-beef steak , ginger chicken , and seafood-tofu claypot total incl gratuity : ~ $ expensive . definitely gone down-hill . and quite simply put , not worth it . the only thing worth mentioning was the soup . the pepper beef steak was sliced way too large and quite difficult to chew . the ginger chicken was terribly dry . and i was n't interested in taking another bite of the seafood tofu claypot . to top it off , each entree ran $ 12 - $ 18 . $ 60 for four entrees at a chinese restaurant ? ? definitely not worth it it ! i 've typically gone here for lunch and ordered noodles . now i 'm scared and likely not to return . i 'm going to stick with pho in chinatown from now on . fellow yelpers : any suggestions on other better chinese restaurants in the area ? ; )
0	my primary care physician here in phoenix referred me to az advanced dermatology on highland in phoenix for an evaluation of several suspect moles and other skin markings several years ago . that visit with dr machnau was unremarkable . i had quite a bit of sun damage on my skin in my youth so i figured i should be checked every few years and just had another appointment with dr machnau this past week . i have to say it was the shortest appointment i 've ever had with an md in my life ( i 'm 55 years old ) . the doctor arrived in the examining room and i swear she was in and out of there in 3 minutes . she very rapidly examined my face , scalp , shoulders , back , chest , legs , and feet . there was precious little interaction or communication with me . i have to say that it 's seems hard for me to believe that a skilled physician could so quickly perform a careful inspection of an entire body . the visit certainly did not inspire confidence that every spot and lesion was evaluated . i will certainly make arrangements to see another dermatologist the next time i get checked .
0	this borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock . you can never find anybody to help you find something , but the line is short and the clearance section is nice . the bathrooms are so-so . the music selection is great and so are the dvds .
1	great staff ! this time i 'm in the er with my daughter and the wait was ... well there was n't really one ! they do their job they 're quick and caring and really know how to deal with children . i recommend this hospital to anyone with children !
1	this is real magic . i know people think he is a tired act , but he is the originator . houdini did great things , but copperfield is the showman of our time . amazing tricks ... funny jokes ... touching moments about his childhood ( especially the story about his father ) . i will not give away too much . first ... the dude looks like he is in his 20s . that right there is magic . second ... he does n't talk with a lisp and tell stupid jokes * cough * criss angel * cough * third .... his tricks are not overly produced . he does n't have a ton of smoke and mirrors and crazy lights * cough * criss angel again * cough * . he does the stuff right in front of you . i am talking right next to you in the audience ... somebody levitated . i know it is a trick , but that is an entertaining trick . fourth ... he likes to use attractive women from the audience to help him . he has some kind of hotness detector that spots these women . i am always hoping that as part of the trick he makes something pop out that should n't pop out . i have seen him 3 times now and no such luck . fifth ... the room he performs is tiny . you are right next to him . you can tell he has done this and perfected it for a long time . you can tell he has respect for his craft . sixth ... he makes fun of himself some . this is a bit refreshing because most magicians seem to think they are mystics and actually have powers * cough * criss angel * cough * * big cough * david blane * big cough * . seventh ... he tries new stuff . you can tell he gets bored with the same old tricks , which is why if you have seen him once then you need to see him again . you will see new stuff . the entire show will not be new but you will see new tricks that are amazing . also , it is a reasonably priced show and according to my wife it looks saucy to post on facebook that we saw david copperfield .
0	i 've eaten here about 4 times now and i 've yet to have an experience worth more than 3 stars . the food is pretty forgettable , its not bad per say just nothing that wows you . the cobb salad is .... a cobb salad . the burger is a generic but good burger . get my drift ? no culinary delights , just decent tastes with decent portions . i noticed that they recently dropped their prices , maybe in response to the feedback here . from memory i think the burger used to cost $ 15 and it is now $ 10 or so . they are also running a pretty serious happy hour , its like 3-9pm ( dont quote me on that ) , probably trying to drum up some business . the reason i always come here for business lunches is that it is always empty and the tables are comfy , making for easy conversation .
1	very consistent . this location always does well with service .
1	i tried toast for the first time this past weekend and would definitely recommend it . i came in for brunch with a friend , and yes , there was about a 15 minute wait , but they served us coffee in the meantime . and they offer you corn bread and apple butter as soon as you 're seated - a great start . it 's a much bigger space than i expected , and they really efficiently take care of everyone with the team service . even though some other reviews have noted that you do n't get to develop a relationship with the servers , they were all incredibly friendly and helpful so it really did n't matter to me . we got omelettes and a side of french toast and everything was great . it was exactly what we wanted and served incredibly quickly but without rushing us . i 'll definitely be back .
0	understand that if you are looking for the vegas experience , do n't come here . you will not get it here . even if i put these items aside , i still experienced issues with my stay . first , even though the facility appeared to have undergone a bit of a face lift ... well it just did n't lift quite high enough for me . the rooms ... even if you decided to put in a flat screen television ( which they did ) does not mean that it makes the room better . the carpet is worn over and the air did not work very well . frankly it was a sauna , no matter how many times we tried to turn it down . the beds were okay . i just could n't get past how worn the room seemed . in addition , very small . there was not a lot of wiggle room with two full size beds ... oh that 's right , the size of the bed . i am five foot five inches . when i spanned my arms across the bed my hands dangled over . weird . i am happy i did not have to share . on the plus side they do have a 24 hour starbucks on site and they have a coffee maker in the room ! this locate is geared towards business travelers . there is a 24 hour gym ( which is quite nice actually , considering that i had just come from a place where their gym closed down at 7 pm .... i know it is vegas and i should be out drinking and causing general chaos at 7 pm not trying to work out ) . the wifi was spotty , so much so that i wound up turning on my own hot-spot rather than deal with it . as stated before this is not for the vegas experience . it is located a few blocks from the strip and as someone mentioned before i do n't believe that i would walk by myself at night from the strip back to the hotel . in fact , i did n't and i was with someone . we grabbed a cab rather then debate whether or not we may be uncomfortable . so in a nutshell if i were a business traveler and wanted nothing else other than business amenities , then i would probably check this place out , maybe . oh ... and stop saying you have a casino on location ... just because you splattered a few machines on your lobby floor ( okay maybe more than just a few ) does not ( in my head of course ) qualify as a casino . this description is disappointing especially when you are using a third party site that is attempting to describe the facility .
1	love , love , love this place ! ! ! atmosphere is great , decor is nice , music is good , very nice for date night ! food is amazing ! ! ! started with mu sake , yay ! ! the 30 hour pork belly is fabulous ! this is an absolute must ! the short rib is fabulous ! and again this is an absolute must ! i had the fiery noodles and yes ... they are fiery , really fiery , and they were great ! ! we also loved the spicy tempura shrimp and the stuffed chicken thigh . service is impeccable and food is really , really amazing ! ! going back friday !
1	i never really had indian food in vegas , but wanted to try some nice place . the reviews for this place and tamba were nice , but wanted to find some place off the strip and with easy parking so picked mint . the place looks little shady from outside , the plaza was dark and the restaurant did not seem very brightly lit from outside . but do n't worry it 's a great place from inside . the decor is nice and upscale . it 's a quite place , with comfortable seating . the lights could be brighter . there were few other table 's occupied ( all by indians ) - a good sight if you are looking for true indian spicy food and not tamed down for the american population . the waiter was nice , pleasant and took out his iphone while talking to us . realized within minutes he was noting down our order with an app from the app store . also said they own a software company and are going to start using their own app in some time . coming to the main part ! food ! it was really good . we ordered mint lassi and masala chhas . both were very indian and really tasty . their menu is very well organized . great for vegetarians and vegans since each item says if its good for vegetarians or vegans . very happy to see how they describe each item in the menu really well . one of the best organized menu 's among all restaurants ( comparing to all indian , american etc . restaurants ) . for the main course we ordered paneer makhani , daal makhani and chole with naans . everything was really good . daal was very tasty , although the color might make you think its not the best , but trust me the taste is nothing short of what you find back home . naan 's were also very good . they also have nepalese food but did not try it , but would love to try that too . overall great place if you are looking for true indian food . would definitely go back again .
1	love , love , love this place ! the food is good and they sell sour , spicy sausage that i order at lotus of siam . i was stupid and only ordered one order or 3 sausages , next time i 'll make sure to order at least 5 more orders ! i can eat them all day ! my daughter loved the bbq skewers , if i was smart i should 've ordered the box of 10 but it was my first time there and such a rookie . the pad thai was good but the papaya salad was delicious ! i tried the lous style and was not disappointed ! i will definitely make sure i stop by every month to support the monastery with their mortgage !
0	so i returned here for a quick lunch today after probably 8 years and have to say i was sadly disappointed ... i remember this being `` the place '' to get amazing thai food and it is clear to see that the owners are running themselves ragged trying to manage this place today .. the restaurant is dated , not clean and disorganized , giving an unwelcome feel . to top that off , the masuman i had was blah and the chicken was dry and overcooked .. buffet was n't looking great either . i hope they get the help they need to make this place what is use to be .
1	great service . i had the portobello panini and totally loved it . and my drink was a fresh strawberry lemonade witch i recommend 100 % . my dad had the beat salad and was great . and perfect portion sizes . the pizza was a hit with the kids . the best part was the people working there . we got some cookies ( amazing ) and the guy at the counter refused our money for them . you should go there we loved it so much ! !
1	i love mamma mia 's and eat there often . the pizza is my favorite in town , the caesar salad is always fresh , and the meatballs rock ! ! i 've never had any thing there that i did n't enjoy . do n't miss out ! !
0	i have n't sampled the entire menu , but for a place with pizza in the name , it 's a bit lackluster . decent bang for your buck though . good heavy crust , not too spongy , not too tough . way too much cheese , not nearly enough sauce and it was too bland . good crisp veggies though . they also have baklava which is pretty good , but not made in house which is probably why it 's pretty good . have n't tried the rest of the menu , doubt i will .
0	i went in the store today for the 2nd time and customer experience was terrible . they have the must unhappy angry people working there . while i was picking out fabrics one employee said to another lady employee near me that a gentlemen needed a lot of help and could she help . she frowned and then angrily said `` for what ? '' . she was so bothered that she might have to actually talk to someone and help them out . then once i went over to the cutting station the women helping me was so bothered there were kids in the store and just stared at them like she was going to kill them . and if she had paid attention she would of seen that i 'm 9 months pregnant ( with my first child i might add ) and that her attitude towards children only made me very uncomfortable as a pregnant women and customer . she then began to complain about children and looked so unhappy just to be alive . i 'm writing this to let you know how angry i left the store when before i even entered i was just happy . good customer service really helps the company to shine and the customer to feel welcomed back and really i do n't feel that way .
0	are you kidding me with the salt ? ordered the steak main course with side of fries . could not believe how salty it was .... enjoyed the oysters the most . but even with this , found bits of shell in my last oyster . too much hype . was an early fan but , for what you pay for , not going back ..
1	typically i would stay at city center but was hearing good things about this place so decided to try it out . i always like newer hotels . well , because they are just `` new '' . for the price it 's unbeatable . room is nice . it 's not small . i do n't know why people post that these are small rooms . i 'm in a premium . paid 67 after resort fee . and stop complaining about the resort fees . all of vegas charges this ! ! ! ! it is true to its claim , smaller boutique hotel . you do n't feel like your in vegas . valet is great . texting thing is awesome . distance to room is simple and not far away . i sware people who complain about the tower being far away . you 're mental . try navigating through caesars , or mgm . it 's as if you 've never been to vegas . this place is charming . the access to the street is awesome and the street is clean . newer . i feel like i 'm in downtown san diego . triple george grill is just down the street . not the typical $ 100 steak you see everywhere else in town . my filet was $ 26 . i think that 's fair . half shower is not that bad . come on ! ! ! water pressure is just ok. but seriously . you people complaining about the water going everywhere . you act as if this is your house as if youre going to clean it up . the water does not go everywhere unless you do jumping jacks in the shower . give me a break . i sware i think people just want to hear themselves whine . and you do not freeze because of the half wall . yelpers can be so dramatic and kind of dumb . the only reason why i gave 4 is because of the music . you can hear it even at the top floor . this is a problem for this hotel . it 's my belief that when i party i 'm partying . but when i 'm in my room , i want peace and quiet . ask for the top floor . away from street and it will be a good experience . and one last thing , i would never drink out of a coffee maker in a hotel room . never . not only does the coffee usually totally suck , imagine all the people using it . so once again , you posters complaining about that , carry your lazy butts downstairs and buy a cup of real coffee and suck it up because you are paying for it and remember you did n't spend the $ 200 per night rate at the encore .
0	wow . what a letdown . maybe i let hype get to me again , but overall , gaby et jules just did n't satisfy my expectations of what a good macaroon should be . from an atmosphere perspective ... although the owner and staff were extremely happy to serve us ... the whole white glove affair just seemed a little stuffy . i decided to splurge and get a few different types of macaroons and a pastry . ignoring the sticker shock i endured ( almost $ 3 per macaroon ... really ? ) , i was incredibly underwhelmed by quality , complexity and ingenuity of the options . do yourself a favor and grab some macaroons from a non-traditional spot ( such as marty 's market , or if you have the privvy ... simplified versions at the duquesne club ) as these babies just are n't up to par .
0	i recently had cox out to install internet and cable . when i received the bill , cox had charged me to fish 3 lines into the walls and one from the front of my unit . so there are 4 seperate charges for puling lines into my unit . besides having a coupon for free installation , my unit had just been renovated and the general contractor had put all new lines in the wall and could be accessed right at the attic opening . i told cox that the gc could confirm that the lines were there . i explained to cox communications that there was a mistake and that i should n't be charged for the fished lines . cox said they were going to investigate this , but they never even called me back and the charges are still on my account . they have the worse customer service and i should have ordered direct tv . -mike in phoenix
0	way overrated .... it is huge but i found a hair in my food and i have been burping up what i did eat all day ... it was $ 45.00 plus tip for 2 adults and 2 children .... i will never go back !
0	shame that it now seems that you will have to insist on defining good service for some of the agents here . the host we ordered from did not know enough to let us know that there is a price difference on the boneless wings versus the bone in wings . as a result she miss quoted our total bill . she did want to get paid before our order came out and i think that was because she realized that we did not get what we ordered ! we spoke with randon who was the manager and who easily rectified the scenario but despite his efforts , the whole experience was trying , also , be prepared to not receive any option of ranch or blue cheese with your wings . apparently pizza hut powers that be do n't feel that you need these with the wings and they will add an additional charge if you ask for this . my pizza was ok. and when there is a ten dollar special you may be able to endure the additional entertainment in the drama of ordering .
1	very nice a little dated but all in all very nice . if only it was closer to my house .
0	i had high hopes when i saw an asian fusion food truck on the asu campus , but i was very disappointed with my first experience . i ordered the k-pop tacos , since putting asian fillings inside a taco was one of the best ideas anyone ( i.e . kogi in la ) has ever had . the filling at fan boy was quite good : marinated chicken in a gochujang style sauce , green onions , sesame seeds and kimchee . unfortunately , the filling was served in the worst stale , cold , dry , nasty corn tortillas i 've had the displeasure of eating in a long time . they were complete garbage . whoever thought it would be acceptable to serve tacos on that crap should be fired . like serving a sandwich on stale bread , it does n't matter how good the filling is . a bad tortilla ruins a taco . the filling was promising enough that i will still try fan boy again . once . if the next dish has another huge flaw , i 'm done with them .
1	this place is banging ! a group of us from work decided to head here friday night to celebrate something . what it was evades me , and probably is n't that important . what matters is we were able to take over the upstairs balcony , have good service and drink like we were back in college . the times i 've eaten here before , it 's always been very good . i did not eat last night ; rather , i imbibed quite liberally . three guinnesses and two irish car bombs later , i was pleasantly relaxed and had to kick it . i was glad i had n't driven because parking is at a premium . that and the whole drinking and driving thing is so 1988. buzzed walking is tubular !
1	this is a really really nice , upscale place . despite their very unique and local menu , my favorite is probably their cornbread with the fruit butter . i think they whip it in case and it literally just melts on the cornbread and then subsequently your mouth . we got the quail , burger , and kimchee fried rice with pig ears . everything tasted very good , and our server was excellent . very knowledgeable and very well spoken .
0	one of the best and worst las vegas experiences iv had . now getting a michael angelo suit with a pool table for under $ 500 a night on a labor day weekend last minute sounds great right ? well listen to this story . we went to las vegas a day early innately staying at the mgm so we needed a room and they were all out we got recommended to this place by someone working at mgm . now we get there at first scared to go in because it looked like a motel 8 from the outside . but we gave it a shot anyways . we walked in and it looked really cool at first so were like this is better then we thought . we made friends fast with jen the girl working up front and soon checked out there rooms . the first room they gave us with there standard room which was small but nicely decorated that had a busted door so for security reasons we asked for a room change . instead of getting a room change we decided to shell out the extra cash and get the michael angelo suit . honestly it was tacky and looked and smelled like a place a pimp would bring his hoes for a orgy . but whatever we decided to make the best of it . the girl who gave us the tour to the room mentioned that this hotel is non-smoking but if u get the suit u can do whatever u want u can smoke there just crack open the window . like a dumby we trusted her and smoked in the room to only find later they hit me with a $ 250 fee . the room was split between me and my cousin but i got hit with the fee . then when i called them to ask for my money back they said they would give only half and i said fine . and then i saw my bill they didnt take it off i called back later they said oh yeah we were supposed to take it off but there manager reversed it and that if i want to pay half they decided i should have my cousin pay half of it which i was not going to do .. there a bunch of let downs . my advice is just stay away from this place its shady get a real room at a real place like palazzo or mgm or wynn were u can smoke at least and not get hit $ 250 for a cheep wan na be motel 8 turned into a `` local crack spot '' hotel .
0	my wife and i have been here two days , with two more to go . room is tiny , shower is tiny , bed is tiny . shower head is broken , ice machine does n't work , breakfast is terrible , wi-fi is poor ( weak signal everywhere in the building ) . but it 's a good location , and the staff has been friendly , so i give it two stars .
0	not a phillies or eagles bar as they claim to be . asked the bartender/owner how the phillies were doing and can you get them on tv . her response was '' i do n't care about that '' . that means she does n't care about my business . keep your ghetto cliente and keep watching your cooking shows .
0	this place was so bad , we ordered and 45 minutes later we had to go and check with someone what had happened to our order , and the waitress then asked us what was our order ! ! ! ! ! ! the food was bad too , order pad thai noodles with mix of meat and the meat did n't look fresh or tasted good , since we checked for our food they brought it right out of the pan and as searing hot and not even a warning . service was terrible , could n't even get a coke , for that i had also to go the counter and ask for it a 4th time .
1	parking free , drinks are doubles , free w/guestlist . spanish dancing all night in a classy location !
1	one of the advantages to being a las vegas local , are access to the resort pools . the m resort has an awesome deal for locals in the summer . $ 10 for locals , but women can put their name on a list , and it is free entry for the rest of the summer . sorry guys , you still need to pay every time . however , the last time i came , a friend had rented a daybed , and it was free but there was a minimum of $ 200 in food and drinks . well , a huge group of friends came out and did not have to pay entry because we all said we were there for the daybed under our friend 's name . and between the 20 of us , we definitely spent way more than the minimum requirement . best of all , the food and drinks were delish ! the pitchers of margaritas and mojitos were pretty potent . they did not skimp on the alcohol at all . i also love that it is so kid friendly . there are these huge entrance sections with only 10 inches of water and is the perfect place for the little ones to just wade in and splash . the crowd is also a lot more laid back and chill than the strip resort pools . there are also a ton of families . but , my favorite perk is the fact that it is not a long hike to get to the pool from the parking structure . the servers are super friendly and we rarely waited to get anyone 's attention . and if you are a guest of the hotel , definitely make time to relax poolside , soak in the vegas rays , and enjoy a cocktail . * yelp 100 challenge : review 50/100 *
1	love this place ... love the vibe , warm colors , cold beer and friendly staff ... we like to sit at bar to get a lot of inside scoop of what 's hot and what 's not on the strip ... beleive me , bartenders know all ... pub spots are killer as well as the fish and chips , oh and do n't forget the truffle fries that absoutly one my favorite dishes ever . overall-good pull
1	this restaurant is a jewel in the city of las vegas . i urge all to experience a meal here . i am surprised at the wide range of flavors that come out of one kitchen . i have been here at least 10 times and have n't been disappointed once ! some may comment on the prices at first but once you see the portion sizes such as their veal parmesan portion it is actually a deal ! they offer other incentives like coupons on restaurant.com ( make sure you read the fine print ) , and mondays are half off all bottles of wine . dine in then tell your friends .
0	i 'm not a lover of pizza , and you 've got to be able to carry out , because there is no seating ! the $ 5.00 one topping pizza deal is awesome ! ! ! ! the pepperoni is always ready ! the quality of the pizza is good . better than higher priced competitors , that deliver . the ingredients are cheap , to keep the price down . customer service needs improvement . they make you feel like they want to get rid of you . for the price , i 'd go back . not for quality , or customer service .
0	the service was okay with the waiter but the paying for the bill was horrible , we waited for 10 minutes at the stand and no one came . they do not have a kids menu which was sad but they did cater more towards the elderly with discounts as well . i would not go back because it was nothing special but the retro decorations made it an interesting stop !
0	went in on a weekday around 4pm . there were four other tables , three of which were already served when we came in and one that was seated after us , a party of two looking to spend around $ 40 . 26 minutes later , and we still has not been asked our order . we had our menus closed and were waiting to spend our money . alas , the chinese wait staff served the chinese customers who came in after us , so we ended up leaving and spending money elsewhere . if you can wait more than 26 minutes to be checked on , and tolerate differential service that appears based on skin color and appearance , maybe this place is for you . it 's not for us and i 've removed it from my restaurant rotation . we 'll have no problem finding solid asian fare in this town .
1	second time this week . great on the hibachi side and sushi is just as good . happy that this location is near me because there is n't too many hibachi style restaurants in the northwest side of vegas . will keep coming back !
1	yes , you can find a cheaper tire . i like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase . another great thing - i was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes ! extra star for their awesome service !
0	i 've usually had a great experience with hertz , and although my experience was n't bad , i was n't fully satisfied , and it was mainly due to the maintenance of the vehicles . i had to switch my vehicle twice , and ended up driving 3 different vehicles within a span of two days . the first vehicle , a 2012 ford focus , was n't cleaned and it showed in the dirty exterior and interior . it also smelled like cigarettes inside . i ended up getting a nissan versa afterwards , but there was a problem with the e-brake as it would constantly think it was engaged so it would let off an annoying beeping noise as your drove . finally , i got a chevy sonic which drove great . through all this , the staff was very understanding and allowed me to switch vehicles with no problems . the customer service up front was great , but the problems i 've had with vehicles leads me to believe that they are n't maintained the best they could be . overall , my recent experience will make me look into what other car rental services have to offer .
1	sweet republic is seriously amazing . i have high standards for frozen dairy treats , and sweet republic is waaayy up there ! i was drawn to this place after learning about their unique artisan ice cream flavors : blue cheese honey , sweet corn , real mint , maple pecan ... plus housemade marshmallows - yum ! i was finally able to convince my hubby to make the pilgrimage because they are ( incredibly ) open until 11pm on fridays and saturdays , which makes it the perfect late night date spot : ) the shop is supercute , decor is contemporary and cheerful , with unique lighting fixtures . the tables are lined up along a banquette on the side of the restaurant - again , very date friendly ! you can cozy up with your significant other while savoring some yummy icecreamy goodness . they have a stack of board games at the back of the restaurant , which i thought was a nice touch as well - how fun to get some delicious icecream while playing connect four with a friend ? the menu is excellent : from the icecreams themselves to the sundae options and awesome toppings , you really ca n't go wrong . i went in expecting to order the campfire s'more sundae , but made a rogue move at the last moment and switched over to the pecan turtle sundae in a waffle cup ... omgoodness , so , so great . before settling on my sundae , i did get a quick sample of the plum verbena icecream and wow - light , refreshing , and unique - definitely a good pick if you 're in the mood for a scoop or two . now , back to the pecan turtle sundae : i 've had lots of turtle sundaes and this one was just head and shoulders above anything else i 've ever tasted . i seriously dreamed about it from the time i left sweet republic until the following weekend , when we returned so that i could have it again ( and share it with my grandmother , who is a fellow appreciator of a good frozen treat ! ) the sundae is topped with hot fudge and salted caramel sauce , fresh whipped cream , and pecans that are toasted/transformed into little nuggets of greatness . the waffle bowl was the crowning glory : sweet , crispy , crunchy and delicious - be sure to get one : ) my husband ordered the cookie mintifesto and he loved it , although i was n't a huge fan of the `` real '' mint - i prefer fake mint , i guess : ) it was pretty `` brisk '' and not very sweet . my son tried the honey blue cheese on our second visit and was smacking his lips and `` mmm-mmm '' ing the whole time . service was alright - the sundaes take a bit of time to make and when they 're busy , the employees seem stressed . i ca n't recommend sweet republic enough as a must-try destination in itself , but it will also become an `` anytime '' place that you 'll find yourself headed to every opportunity you have .
0	new to the area , i was looking for nail salons and came here . after a week 4 of my nails peeled off easily and the rest were all well on there way to coming off . wont be going there again .
0	a renovation ... looks to be different kitchen and wait staff as well ... tho the wait staff is needing a little contact with regard to acceptable and appropriate daytime restaurant service attire . there has been a renovation ... and the space has certainly been improved . with about 60 seats in the room , the colors and varying heights/spacing of the tables of dining areas make for what feels like privacy . on arriving 11:30 am on a thursday , i was gratified to see about 40 people in the restaurant . with no sign about seating self or waiting , i caught the eye of one of the waitress ' and she directed me to a seat not far from the kitchen/main service area . i sat and received both water and menu . double-sided , but only lunch menu ... no indication of the salad i wanted . from previous experience as well as menu of other thai basil around the valley , i know the staff has the ingredients and knows how to make my papaya salad ... som tom . if you have seen any previous review , you know that som tom is julienned green papaya prepared with thai chili , fish sauce , garlic , fresh-squeezed lime juice , tomato and palm sugar . the salad is frequently offered with green beans , shrimp or salt crab . it may also have julienned carrot in small portion . when the questionably attired waitress came to take my order , i requested som tom and steamed rice ... ordered thai hot , no green bean and no shrimp . she wrote down my order and turned to tender my order . on to the phone , checking email and news , occupying my time until lunch arrived . the salad and rice were presented to me in about 10 minutes . what appeared to be a very large portion of papaya salad , about 3 cups , was an illusion . the salad was placed on top of a pretty large amount of lettuce , which i did not see until i had taken a few bites of the salad . i figure i actually had about 1 1/4 cups of papaya salad . spice was 5 ( makes my nose run , while 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes ) . rice ... a pricy portion , 1 cup , fresh and well presented . just kinda hurts to have to pay for rice that is a traditional accompaniment . no windows on the west side means comfort for afternoon and early evening enjoyment ... with regard to the questionably attired waitress , what is going on with the denim shorts not fastened in front , hanging off the backside ... netting and a t-shirt that does not meet the waist of the denim shorts ... it leads me to wonder about the cleanliness of the presentation .
1	i am not vegan or vegetarian but my friend is so i went with him and thought i would try it . i had the bbq seitan and for someone who does n't eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good . it had the look , feel , and taste of bbq pork . i also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte . i do n't think i would go back again because i like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out ! !
0	i have been getting my brows threaded for years by a licensed cosmotologist . after my lady ( anita from salon naturalle ) moved out of state i went and saw donna based on the rave reviews here . i let her know about all her wonderful reviews on yelp and she said she had no idea since she did not have any time to be on the computer . when i walked in i was the only one there . i felt when i left my brows were cleaned up , but i did not get the arch i had in the past . also i had to come home and finish the job on my upper lip because there was hair that she missed . she seemed nice , but was arrogant . and even went as far to say that she was the only person in arizona that knows how to shape the brow according to peoples faces . when i told her my previous threader was of indian decent and i was told that `` they all left the state because its not legal '' . i was taken back since anita was legal and licensed and had her own business at salon naturalle . i wo n't be returning . it was not a good experience and i did not get the wow factor from the service .
1	this restaurant is located on the second floor of neiman marcus at the fashion show mall . right when you walk in it feels like you are walking into a cool night club . the decor is is awsome ... the striped carpeting , the big tables accented with what i believe was red cushioned chairs . you look up and walk into area of red skylights , which fire you up . at the edge walls , blue light filters down . the place is very well lit . the awesome thing about this place is the view . if you pass by the outside of neiman marcus , youll notice the corner of a glass square/rectangular structure popping out on the second floor of the store . so in the restaurant you can sit in this area behind blue stained glass which overlooks the las vegas strip with views of ti across the street and the new casino next to the venetian . on the table i noticed that the napkins were placed in napkin rings ... impressive . the bread here was fabulous . its called monkey bread . the muffin looking like bread was slightly firm on the outside with a cross cut on top . the bread breaks perfectly into 4 pieces revealing a warm , chewy , soft , and creamy flavor inside . the goat cheese salad was only good b/c of the goat cheese . the bitter spring salad took away from the pungent cheese . i had to eat the cheese seperately and feel it crumble and meld together in your mouth ... yummy . i followed this with a thick piece of filet mignon and crisp fingerling potatoes . then , it was finished by a glazed baked pear . this was so good , it took me back when my grand uncle used to bake apples with brown sugar . yeah , simple recipe but damn good dessert . i would like to come back again to hit up the rest of the menu ...
0	i drove a long way to try this place based on the reputation . it was in the middle of a rundown industrial setting , looking more like the back of a warehouse than the front of a restaurant . when i got there at 5pm on a saturday , two carloads of would be customers were already there banging on the gates and windows in bewilderment that there was no one there and there was no note on the door explaining why they were closed and not serving dinner on a saturday evening ! i will not waste my time on this inconsiderate dive again .
0	i normally order my thai about a 4 out of 5. i read the warning on yelp about the heat , so i ordered a 2. it was too hot . i do n't know why a restaurant would use such a different scale than every other restaurant in town but , that definitely detracted from my enjoyment of my meal . it was `` ok '' food , divey atmosphere but the service was friendly . i would n't go out of my way to go back here as there are so many other fabulous thai places in town .
0	we discovered this place in the current phoenix magazine today . the place has a great look outside , upon arriving and inside was just as pleasant . it has a great patio out back but goodluck finding it . i read that one is to follow the paw prints on the floor ... could not find the paw prints and had to ask for directions . i did like that they provide dog biscuits and water out back . we sat down starving , when our very friendly server , hillary , immediately arrived to welcome us . being our first time , we were eager to hear about the food but she completely assumed we were there to just drink . are you pushing the brew here folks or the food ? at least ask us why we are there first before you go on and on about the beer . we started out with the garlic hummus , which was good but it came out rather quickly . i question whether it was freshly made or from cisco foods . the cucumbers that came with it , were dried out , gross and rubbery . my partner ordered the green chili stew tacos and i had the barbecue hamburger . both were ok .. it 's above average , bar food and need improvement . one of the tacos had a big piece of gristle . do n't you check your meat chef before you send it out ? complete lack of focus and concern for the quality of the food being sent out . you might not care for my review but if you care about your brand and what you represent ... not just your brewery ... you will take our first visit review seriously . i know this may sound harsh but i must remain honest . people may come for great brew but they also for great food .
0	i was really , really looking forward to sunday brunch at the herb box , as i have heard rave reviews ! i have also walked past it many times on the waterfront , and have enjoyed the live music i 've heard , as well the chic look of the place . i 'm a definite foodie , and the menu looked great , so i was stoked to try it ! well , i 'm not sure if the restaurant was having an `` off '' day or what , but our experience at the herb box today was terrible , from beginning to end . : - ( maybe it 's all part of some restaurant `` rudeness '' kitsch that i am unaware of , but i really hate to say that the service was pretty awful -- the hostesses were snobby and unfriendly , and the wait staff was very inattentive . i accidentally spilled a glass of ice water on my lap as our server handed it to me , and he just left the table without a word , and without offering or bringing back any napkins . lucky for us it was 90 degrees out and it all dried fast ! : - ) and then the food . ugh . really disappointing , especially for the price . i ordered a strawberry lassie to drink with a market blt , based on yelp recommendations . the lassie was literally curdled and undrinkable , and the blt had absolutely no bacon/pancetta on it . my husband ordered the smoked salmon hash , which promised an impressive array of fresh ingredients and flavors , but in actuality looked and tasted like canned fish mixed with fried potato chunks . awful , awful . i do n't like to complain about food while sitting at a table , and i never send anything back . in this case , i really wish i had been able to , but we only saw our server twice -- once when he took our order and again when he brought the check . he did not deliver our food and no one ever refilled our drinks . at that point , we just wanted to get out of there , so after 90 minutes of being basically ignored by the wait staff , we left with empty stomachs , out $ 50.00 . total waste , will probably never return . bummer ! : - (
0	ugh , where to begin ? service is terrible from the waitresses who speak very little english , have no sense of urgency , and actually gave me attitude for requesting wasabi . that 's right , my odd request at a japanese restaurant while having bland tuna steak was met with sarcasm and disbelief that made not only my date and i cringe and do a double take , but the rest of the table also noticed and talked about the attitude . it also took her about 3/4of the meal to bring the hot sauce i requested with my appetizer . it felt odd giving her any tip at all with her bad attitude and piss poor service oh and the tuna was near flavorless , drown in what tasted like straight up vinegar and covered with soggy onion crisps and a few edamame beans . gross . my date had tofu steak which was worse . it was undercooked , soggy , and flavorless as well . with as much butter they use you would think some flavor would even accidentally happen . no such luck . she requested noodles instead of rice which cost an additional $ 7 ( ridiculous upcharge for butter noodles ) and still that meal was borderline inedible . leftovers were okay because i know how to cook tofu and add spices to food to enhance flavor . if i could give 0 stars to this pathetic overpriced bland food a thon , i would .
1	just a shout out for ginger luke and the outstanding creativity she has for designing hair ! she is the only one that my 15 yr old daughter , madisson , will let touch her hair . thanks for listening and loving what you do ! : )
0	lousy ! rude but most importantly she butchered my pants ! do not use
1	born and raised in vegas , but have n't been in the gold spike until now ( no longer a resident of nevada ) . i expected it to be way more dirty adn dive-y , but was surprised at how bright and clean it was . it was n't full of people either ( i guess cus it was a couple days before xmas ) so it made it even more pleasurable . the bartender ( dani ? ) was a total sweetheart and was well acquainted with my barfly friend who got me interested in the joint in the first place . drinks were cheap and delicious ( but makers mark always is ) . i definitely plan on going back whenever i 'm in town and may even try to stay in the rooms ... we 'll see how brave i feel : d
0	nice italian restaurant for a simple lunch or dinner . flavors are good , service is ok and quick but this is not an upscale restaurant it is instead a neighborhood place that is ok. if you are a student or professor at unc charlotte it is one of the better places for lunch in the area .
0	my friends and i went here for dinner one night , and i wish we had n't . we were hankering for some tex-mex type food , but this place , while it looked promising , was a major fail . we were seated right away , but that was the only positive of the evening . we ordered chips and salsa . the salsa tasted alright , but the chips tasted like they were poured into our bowl from one of those $ 2 bags you find at the grocery store . blah . the food we ordered was incredibly salty ! ! salty to the point where it was nearly impossible to eat it ! everyone ended up only eating about half their entree as a result , and even that was a bit of a struggle . two in our group ordered mango margaritas , and both of them said they were n't very good at all . and then the waiter ... he was mia for most of the night , and i felt like taking our order , refilling our drinks and checking in on us was a bother for him . i do n't need my waiter to be uber-friendly , but he/she should at least be attentive and a little personable . bad food , bad service .
1	bloody mary 's were great food was awesome . dave and roxanne ate great people .
1	what a fabulous venue for yet another fabulous yelp event . from the valet to the restrooms . from the vast modern space to impressive and friendly service . and the food ! oy ve ( that 's japanese for yummy ) ... ika furai age watari gani abura bouzo no tataki shiro asparagus zoe butaniku to hotate no gyoza yakitori-negima yaki ok. admit it . you know asparagus . but what about the rest ? well , you 'll have to check out roka akor to find out . cuz i 'm not spilling it . my fave was the abura bouzo . buttah ! like a big stick of buttah ! i could have chowed down several more . and then several more . light and airy with clean lines and muted tones , this is contemporary asian at its best . origato . dori ori gato mr. roboto .
1	ordered take out . best potato salad i 've ever had ! ! the crab cakes were delish and the corn bread was a perfect accompaniment . i also enjoyed the brown rice as well as the pasta . ca n't wait to get back here and try more stuff ! !
0	this store is cramped and triggers my claustrophobia . they have tons of merchandise and prices are ok. i 'm a forever 21 type of gal these days . unfortunately charlotte russe designs their clothes to look cheap . i only go to cr for the jewelry , not bad .
0	the burgers are fantastic . the staff could be a bit more pleasant , but the food is so yummy that i 'm willing to overlook their indifference . : )
1	i had read a review in the city paper that gave southside bbq company a great review so i 've been wanting to try it . today we were having a late lunch so we decided to check it out . there were four of us and we all ordered something different . it was like a big sampler . my husband ordered the chicken nachos and the chili . a lot of times nachos are so huge that it big enough for 3 people . the nachos here are just the right size . tithe chips were topped with cheese , bbq sauce , smoked chicken and jalape\u00f1os . they were tasty . the smoky chicken made them amazing . the chili came in a small crock . it was bubbling and hot . it was full of flavor . it had beans and bites of smoked brisket . my oldest son ordered the redneck club sandwich . it came on a brioche bun that had brisket and pork with a bit of coleslaw . he inhaled it . that 's very telling if how good it was . my youngest son ordered a burger . he 's a purist so it was just meat and a bun . you know it 's a good burger when it tastes good without any toppings . the burger tasted like it was hot off a charcoal grill . it even had grill marks . i ordered 6 wings . i was going to share them but after tasting them i no longer wanted to share . the wings are not winglets and they are n't fried . they are whole wings and they are grilled . they are the best wings i 've ever had . i was kind enough to share . . . this time . for dessert we ordered peach cobbler . it was a little different from normal cobblers . it was more like a thick piece off a dense cake . it had a lot of peaches on it along with vanilla ice cream . it was warm and satisfying . it was big enough for 3 of us to share . we 'll definitely be back . i recommend you stop in and try it out . make sure to order wings .
0	we met a guy while shopping in the mall who put us on the guest list so we got in free and did n't have to wait in line ( there is no way in hell i will stand in line for 2 hours ) . while we were waiting to be let in , we could see the line to get in . it was ridiculous ! seriously , i do n't know how those people could wait in that line . we get in and pass everyone up which was nice . the ambiance was cool but the place was so freakin packed it was a pain in the ass to get anywhere . we tried to dance ! ha ya right ! girls , if you wear open toed heels , be prepared to have to bruised and sore ass toes afterwards because everyone will be stepping on them ! after losing 4 of our friends , my friend and i left to grab something to eat close by . it was nice to get away and not be stuck in a sea of people . we went back to tao a little later and tried to dance some more but it was just too frustrating . we finally decided to leave . i agree that this club is way over-rated ! i would have been pissed if i had waited in line for that club ! tip 1 : when you go to the bathroom , be sure to flip the little switch thingy that frosts the door so people dancing and drinking at the bar do n't see you peeing ! my friend did n't flip it and people got a show . tip 2 : do n't drink to the point where you do n't feel well . if security sees you and you like like you are going to puke , they will take you to their drunk tank ! i kid you not . this happened to my friend .
0	hanny 's is two things .. and neither at full potential . 1st , it is very chic and modern in a retro feel . as far the the interior style and potential i give it 5 stars . i was told the basement will be a full blown dance club in the future . but for now .. this place is completely underused . there is a second bar upstairs , but on a friday night i counted more open tables then filled ones .. so clearly the second bar is premature . 2nd , the pizza tastes good , the flavor i thought was there . but give me a fucking break , 17 bucks for a crispy saltine baked at 600 degrees with some toppings ... drinks were strong .. saving grace on the menu side of this review . but i think the pricing is seriously out of wack for what you get . no free birthday dessert ... better and lesser places have no problem doing this . hell if i was a server .. i would have compped it either way .. it was a table of 10 people drinking and my tip alone was 40 bucks . not to mention the unrequested table bread .... that was put on my bill .. what the fuck ! ! ! it will be awhile before i come back to hanny 's like i said the potential for a 5 star awesome place is there . but seriously the clown menu needs some revisions .. if you want to charge this much for dining , get a real menu deserving of it . hopefully the wait staff too . at one point in the night i saw 3 servers standing around by the main entrance . look busy asshole . coolest thing would be the dj nest over the dining area . also the bathrooms , which i believe used to be dressing rooms . i can totally see some awesome carnal experiances in these private bathrooms . but i think it 's kinda weird the bathrooms are 20 feet from the upstairs bar .. and in line of sight ... hanny 's i wish you the best .. and hope you can grow up to be what you want to be . send me a kite when you do .. i look forward to hearing from you .
0	very basic breakfast , service at this place is horrible , , , do not sit outside , been there twice and same horrible service both times , coffee empty , bussers walking by not helping out . i had to go to the host to get some attention to the table . you can certainly do better than this place for breakfast .
0	they need to find a better way of washing dishes . our coffee cups had stains all over , cutlery had pieces of food and had egg smell all over .
0	i was in the area waiting for an appointment , so i decided to try this place out . the design and interior arrangement is nice and comfy . now , i do care for the espresso quality and have n't had a cup of starbucks for ages ( i do have two of their cups tho ) , so after seeing caribou 's espresso machines , i decided i am not going to torture my taste buds . i ended up having a cup of thai black tea latte , and a brown sugar oatmeal , plus a cranberry orange scone to go . the staffs are ok , not anything more than taking your orders and making them . they do have many varieties on coffee/tea drinks and breakfast pastries and stuff , but the quality , uh , well ... i like how they have various tea latte and you can vary the kind of milk and the degree of sweetness of them , but if you do know well what a cup chai , thai , or oolong tea should taste like , you probably will be disappointed . all in all , if you just want a place to sit and study for a couple hours and not really picky about the tastes , it 's a nice place to be at .
1	i 've been going here since they were in the old location up on east blvd . the staff is friendly and knowledgeable , and their hours are convenient for me .
1	great club/lounge . excellent service and bottle service is a must . the view in the patio is also wonderful . special thanks to dimitri and kristina s for their excellenct customer service and friendliness .
0	ha ha , when i first moved to vegas i quickly named this location , `` ghetto von 's '' ha ha but the funny thing is that as i began to meet new people they all independetly referred to it as `` ghetto von 's . '' so yeah , that pretty much sums it up , this place is hella ghetto . most of the produce is pretty shabby , i get the feeling that this is the place other von 's stores dump their about to expire goods . their prices also suck . i suspect that 's because this is probably the closest grocery store to the strip . the booze and ice in particular are no bargin . and of course you have all the crack heads and freaks hasseling you in the parking lot , that 's always a treat ! steer clear big tuna , head for open waters ! ( that means do n't go here ! )
0	we waited almost an hour to be seated when there were only 3 groups in front of us in line . we got the shrimp wonton soup and some chowmein . i thought the food was boring . i dropped a shrimp wonton in my lap and our server , who was taking an order at the table next to us , stopped what he was doing to point and laugh at me , then finished talking to the table and didnt even stop by to offer me a napkin . when i stopped him later to ask for one he acted put out . they charged us for our tea , and it was gross . i thought the food was boring , and wayyyy overpriced . they dont even put vegetables in their chowmein . i would have only given them one star because i hated the whole experience , but i had to add a star because my husband was happy with getting a chance to sit down and eat what he called simple food . it made him happy so they earn a star .
0	we found this restaurant to be just so-so . it was a bit overpriced for what it is . none of our food or drinks were bad , but nothing stood out either . with all the dining options in vegas , it 's a slippery slope when your food is forgettable . the ambiance was nice and our server was attentive . however , i doubt we 'll go back again .
0	the bar area was nice , but the dining area was off-putting . that side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades . the fresh bread was burnt and tough . the table was a bit crumby . i ordered the shrimp fettuccine alfredo , which admittedly was bland . the server and service were great .
1	first time eating at hungry howies and will certainly go back . service was friendly , pizza fresh and hot and we enjoyed trying the flavored crusts - ranch and asiago .
1	the locals roll here for late nights eats . steak and eggs for $ 4.99 . the best value . if you have another spot please share . this is a nice cut of meat and cook perfectly . i went the first night and ordered the s & e special finished it and ordered another one . then went back the next morning . tasty . i recommend .
0	i 've always wanted to try this place . it 's super near from my apt . so , today ( sunday , mother 's day week ) , i finally gave it a try . the atmosphere is nice . unique . but what l experienced today will not make me review their food entirely . too bad . it 's more about how i felt while i was there . when the waitresses and the servers outnumbered the customers , i learned that it is potentially intimidating for customers like me . i realized i dressed differently from any other customers ! especially when it 's warm outside ! so , seeing a person wearing a scarf with long and fully covered outfit in this weather may be subject to examine . i 'm aware of that . but , when you were eating and kept being stared almost the whole dining time , it was inconvenient ! i was no longer enjoying my food , as i did n't feel good for being stared by a bunch of servers and waitresses all the time from the bar ! i wish i could review the food more , but the way i was 'treated ' just shifted it . this is not my first time to be examined like this , due to my appearance . but today is just a bit too much . the wait staff is the worst . we thanked her and were very polite only to get some rude attitude . the first waitress was kind though . when l asked her to move us to a brighter spot , she was very kind though she also let us know that we would be no longer her customers . they apparently have different section for each waiter/waitress . i apologized several times . the old spot was too dark and i did n't want to have meals there . she was fine . our next waitress was also fine . while the waitress and server were trying to serve us well , their service is overall disappointing . i really hope my hunch was wrong . in all , i did n't feel comfortable and so sad too . i hope my appearance will not make others feel inconvenient and will not make myself a subject to stare at . aside from the non-food review , i regret to say that there 's nothing special with their burgers . you can go to other nearer place for better burgers . but we did enjoy their peanut bomb ! it was fun . and the peanut shooter was nice . i have been hesitant to post this for a couple of days now , but i need to say what i have to say . so , here it is .
1	i have only gone to postino during the monday/tuesday $ 20 nights where you get a bottle of wine and choice of 3 bruschettas for the cheap price of $ 20 . i always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of brie & apples with fig , prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil . i usually go with a few of my girlfriends and this makes a great meal with fantastic wine and some good gossip . : ) come early as seats fill up extremely quickly and the wait can get very long . this deal starts after 8pm .
0	panchero 's mexican grill looked interesting to eat at , i love how they prepare their tortilla 's in the big presser they have - but that 's the only thing that impressed me ; the tortilla 's ... since they 're freshly made , they 're still yummy and `` gooey '' - the staff was really nice when we entered , and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders : ) i got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice , the other two people in our party compared it to uncle ben 's rice , the steak we got seemed `` boiled '' , the medium salsa was n't as spicy as i thought it was ( but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces ; of course i grabbed the tapat\u00edo ) , although the salsa was flavorful . my friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great . it seemed they only had montery jack as their cheese . the prices were pretty decent , i think next time i will try something else though !
1	went there the next day and had the chicken salad sandwich which was superb . the people are friendly and attentive .
0	this place is close to my house , so i go occasionally when i just need a mexican food fix . however , i have not had a consistent experience . sometimes the food and service are decent , sometimes just the food , sometimes just the service . totally hit or miss . but i like the small town restaurant feel of this place and perhaps that 's what keeps me coming back every few months or so . definitely experienced better , but most definitely have experienced worse .
1	been watching this place build up over the months as an admirer of the armadillo grill and found the opportunity to mosey over for my last minute thursday night birthday dinner with my wife and friend . the place has always looked packed and we decided to see what the hype was all about . right away - when you walk towards the entrance , you get a sense of the fresh smells and coolness of the place . we were greeted and told that it would be a 20 minute wait . no worries - we went to the bar and ordered some drinks . no wait on the order , even though the the bar was packed . we just stood against the back wall people watching and compared some of the people to the vig for sure without the douchbags standing in the walk way to the bathroom ! but there were grandmas , families , guys having a night out , couples , it was a good diverse crowd ! the place seems to have a more relaxed , cool vibe . seats at the bar opened up right away and we got seated minutes after that . i was wearing shorts , t-shirt and hat and did not feel under dressed at all after looking around and seeing guys in tank tops . our server was cool and did not rush us since we were in good conversation when we got seated . we took a while with the menu and when it was time to order - he was there . we ordered a $ 18 bottle of wine ... let me say this again .... $ 18 bottle of wine ! unheard of ! we had the eggplant bruschetta as a starter - wow ! it was good ! i was expecting pieces of bread breaking apart in your bleeding mouth , with all the stuff falling on the plate destroyed . no way - it was good ! a mix of sweet and sour with a richness that is just good ! we chose to split 3 of the 8 inch pizzas ( $ 10 ea . ) to get taste of everything . we ordered the smokey , the margherita and the yukon gold ( ? ) . the ingredients are so friggin fresh ! ! ! love thin crust , wood fired oven pizza and this hit the spot ! usually i can eat a lot of pizza , but when you get something that tastes so good , you can have a few pieces and be set ! the server had overheard it was my bday , so we asked what he recommended . he said you have to have the tiramisu . good size and def enough to share . it was rich and full of flavor and did not disappoint . the server even brought it with a candle ! just that attention to small stuff like that makes a meal a better experience ! good place ! like others have said - the interior was cool and modern without being too much for pizza ! keeping the block wall from the original building and making it the centerpiece of the room was done very well ! props to the design team for the interior . the open eating/kitchen environment makes it a great place to get a corner table and watch . i would recommend this place for sure . even though some reviewers called it `` vig 2.0 '' - i do not think that is fair - because i would not recommend the vig to everyone . since i am a fan of the armadillo , i know that the parking is a snap if you know where to go and esp . know about the lot behind the armadillo 's lot . so now you have no reason to bitch about parking and not to eat here ! do n't park at best buy either - your gon na die or make the traffic in that area a mess ! glad to have this place in my hood for sure !
1	i love songbird . i work close by , and it 's so nice to have a great coffee house so close . the pastries , which the buy fresh from local makers , are divine . go for the brioche cinnamon roll and thank me later . the coffee is stellar . i ca n't even put a finger on what 's different , but i 'm guessing it 's the utmost attention to quality and detail of their product . seating is a little sparse , and prices are a little high , but the goods received are worth it .
0	thought we would try the place for lunch and sadly very disappointed . the food was poor . we got two `` beer '' bread flatbreads and it was more like stale flour bread . we were the only group in the entire restaurant for the entire time we were there . they need to step up their quality or they will sadly be out .
0	i must say i am more than disappointed with the food and service here . upon our arrival , my boyfriend received his beverage right away but then waited another 10 min for a bartender to inquire about what i would like to drink . another 4 min passed before we had to ask for menus and then another 15 min to take our order . there were maybe 10 people sitting at the bar with 2 bar tenders so they were not busy . when adriana , our server/bartender , took out order she not only did n't know the menu bit gave us a bit of an attitude about the menu and told me i was wrong when i inquired about cheese on the haus burger . upon bringing us the incorrect order , she apologized and took the wrong order back to the kitchen . my boyfriend was waiting for me to get my food but it was taking a while so i told him to eat as his was getting cold . the food was not very good and small portions for the cost . not to mention , he asked for 2 or 3 beers that were on the menu but either changed or no longer offered but no one told us . i work at a restaurant and was very upset about the service or lack thereof . the bill came and no % off was offered for the mistakes . i do n't look for a free meal , but this was a terrible experience and we will not be back .
0	holsteins really was n't as good as i was hoping for ...... this could have been for a number of reasons . should i not have ordered a turkey burger ? probably not because it was meh . every other table was provided popcorn as an appetizer .... after waiting for like 20 minutes i asked our waiter if we could get some . why do i have to ask ? just bring me my damn popcorn i 'm starving ! the buffalo chicken dip was really good ( or was it good bc i was starving ? ? ) and my husband said his burger was pretty decent . the atmosphere was cool and it was in my hotel which is why it gets 3 stars . i might come here again .... if i come back to vegas and stay at the cosmo i probably will ( just out of convenience sake ) but i def wouldnt seek this place out .
0	i was very excited when i saw the 'coming soon ' sign prior to their opening and was looking forward to dining here . i have been there twice now , and do not intend on going back . the food is not bad , but overall , my experience was unsatisfactory . not only are they overpriced , but they are stingy . i absolutely hate restaurants who charge a fortune , but have little to offer . both times i came , i ordered the 1/2 'pollo a la brasa ' ; the second time , they did not give me fries . i was told that they no longer offer fries with the meal . not only is this false advertising on the menu , but this just shows how cheap they are . how expensive are potatoes ? ? please do n't order the yuca fries . the $ 6 order comes with 5 fries , literally . if you are willing to pay over a dollar for a 2-inch fried potato , then by all means go for it . the waitress i had was impatient and gave me all sorts of strange looks each time i tried to get her attention . when i asked for sauce for the chicken ( which should have come with it ) , she looked at me as if i was absolutely insane . if it were not for my co-worker treating , i would have made sure the server received minimal tip . i do not intend on going back to support a business like this one .
0	holy crap ! this place was like walmart on pcp ! between employees on forklifts , grammaws on wheelchairmobiles , soccer moms on cellphones ( watching the aisles instead of where the hell they were going ) , and random foreign dudes ( just standing around and staring in the middle of the aisles as if they were extras from the walking dead ) - it was like real-life frogger . i was n't sure i was going to make it outta there in one piece . a relative from outta town wanted to impress me with her costco card . alright . color me freaking impressed . boner city ! she bought enough stuff that i knew i 'd have to pack the freezer like it was a piece of luggage where you try to fit all the excess crap you bought on your trip by sitting on it just to close it . all i wanted to do was just gtfo as soon as humanly possible . i will probably never get a damn costco card unless there 's a real zombie apocalypse and i end up housing and feeding several infantry units at my place . in that case i probably wo n't need a card . we 'd come back and just take what we need and i bet the same zombies will still be in the aisles . standing . staring . aim for the goddamn head !
0	ehh not worth my time or $ $ i rather go to el gordo and get my tacos idk about their rice dish but the meat on my tacos is the big thing here .. so i would say it ai n't all that .. wo n't come back again i 'm sorry . this place takes forever to make my orders and i was not satisfied .
0	well horrible first visit . ... xoxo do n't get a waiter to save our life . finally grab someone to some , nothing then grab someone else just to be told it 's not my table . then order drinks , they a are the wrong ones and then takes another 20 minutes to get the right ones . talked to manager and all taken care of .
1	when ever you mention `` the vine '' people auto matically assume you are talking about `` the wings '' .people have told me `` the best wings in arizona '' i can tell you they also have a exceptional hamburger . the menu offers all kinds of cheeseburger choices , i would personally suggest the fries as the side dish , but the coleslaw is also good . the place is some what of a `` sports bar '' with tvs all over , i see a lot of small groups watching different games . what i really like is that the place is large enough that you can always get a booth `` away from the noise '' , lol . i do notice that it is `` family friendly '' which i really like . i notice that phoenix metro transport has stops on both the n/s and e/w routes running through the corner . definitely would recommend
1	one of edinburgh 's best musical venues . i 've seen a helluva lot of things in this venue and i never fail to have an excellent time . the sound is brilliant for classical music as well as rock and pop . the stalls are much more comfy these days - i wonder if they 've replaced the seats ? it feels much more spacious and there 's plenty of room for legs , bags , jackets and drinks . the building itself is a mish-mash of old architecture with a modern extension . it 's a genuinely loved piece of edinburgh 's make-up . when i hear a gig will be played here i am always pleased - i 'm still to have a bad experience here .
0	we have been to la calabria a couple of times and the food has been excellent . the butternut squash ravioli is fantastic . service is a little overwhelming . give me some time to read the menu please . a little pricey for what you get . made the mistake of having the house chianti . we did not care for it .
0	i used to love xs but saturday was ridiculous . we got a table for a bachelorette party and i guess since it 's all inclusive ( bottle of vodka , champagne , tax and grat for $ 600 ) we were totally ignored all night after being placed in suburbia on the other side of the pool . we were supposed to have a host text us but none ever did so i had no one to call when we were stuck in the table line forever . my friend has a broken foot and was on crutches so i thought it was ridiculous that they walked the most busy and ass backward way when taking us to the table . he was on his phone the whole time and did n't even wait for my friend to keep us . obviously i did n't tip him . when we got to our table , there was a used condom on the ground next to it and it took an hour and me asking 3 different people to get it cleaned up . service was crappy and people kept sitting on the arms of our couch . security was non-existant which is weird because on the inside and the tables outside but still near the inside part , service and security is great . there was a bunch of people on e , including our neighbors to the left , so that got annoying . then , the club was so over capacity that they would n't even let us inside or near the floor until 3am . they just locked us outside . this place has just been going downhill since hakkasan opened , the acts , the crowd , everything just seems to be getting worse which is a shame because i used to really like xs ( see past review ) . i 'll just stick to other clubs for right now . i mean , even marquee is better .
0	hit or miss . food 's not the freshest , but it 's not that bad . really cheap and big portions .
0	not a traditional brazilian churascuria . no salad bar at all . they bring you a side salad instead . if you are used to fogo or texas de brazil , thus does n't compare . it is $ 45 for all you can eat meats , but again , no massive salad bar . if you do t care about the salad bar , you will enjoy it . meats are good . they even have roasted garlic bread on a skewer . if you are looking for a traditional churascuria with a nice salad bar , i would skip it . but if you are all about the meat you will like it . nice wines also . not cheap , but not outrageous either . a bottle if louis martini for $ 45 . all being said i would not return .
0	so far , this is the most deceptive yelp rating we have found . this is not a 4.5 star mexican restaurant. , and it really is n't even a 3 star eatery . our start here was good , with tasty chips and salsa and a kind waitress whose english was very shaky ( all of which we took as a promising sign ) . we had high hopes as we waited far too long for our food , but the warning signs were already there ; the worst margaritas ever , not even one other party arriving for dinner , and a drab dining room that looked much better in the photos . when the food finally did come , it was just disappointing . and while the salsa that came with the chips was good , both the red sauce , and green sauce that was brought to the table with the food were both lousy . the beans were salty , the rice was weird , and i believe the taco shells were from a box . not one in our party of 5 were the slightest bit impressed with the food quality . not sure why it 's so difficult to find decent mexican food in this town , but it is ! steer far away from el ranchero , it 's one of the poorest i have ever been to . can not believe that some people ranked it so highly ! the only one in the east valley has received rave reviews from us so far , has been `` susies mexican cafe '' in east tempe . take the drive !
0	groupon - why do n't restaurants get that this is their chance to build a following ? to get repeat business ? we went for sunday brunch with our 10 & 8 yr olds . no it 's not a kids joint but our kids have eaten in some of the finest and divey joints around the country . the first thing i notice is the floor is still dirty from what could only be the night before since we were the first ones there . then my water had floaties , coffee cup came with a bit of green stuff . the waitress with dirty looking hair really could n't care less . i ordered the eggs with their name on it . if you put your name on it it better be good right ? i could have made it better at home . it was soooooo salty and yet so boring . it came with potatoes that had to have been mass produced and frozen . blah . my kid ordered the flat bread with short ribs ( a dream for him ) we asked them to leave off the fried leeks , sure ! but added fresh green leeks all over . he is a kid he did n't want leeks ! fried or fresh . i noticed everyone else was drinking maybe that 's what will keep this place going because i ca n't recommend the food or the cleanliness .
0	really , really heavy food . i like meat and they do it well but there is no balance to their meals . an experience , undoubtably , but this place really comes across as a gimmick and not a restaurant run by professionals . a salad on the menu would be nice . that said , the service was spectacularly good .
1	it may look like a fast food joint on the outside but this place is local arizona bbq at it 's tastiest . i ordered the 1/2 lb . pork rib dinner ( $ 11.49 ) which came with two sides . they ran out of collard greens so i settled for two corn cobs . with the ribs and corn my face and fingers are super messy from the sauce . good thing i 'm eating alone . the ribs were super delicious ! i wanted to cover every bite in their bbq sauce . it was that good . the sauce was slightly tangy with just the right amount of sweetness . honey bear 's calls it tennessee bbq , but here in phoenix it 's oh so good .
0	slow servers . soda was only refilled when i yelled out to the server . nothing too special .
1	i love social house for late night dining , happy hour pit stop and drinks with friends before going out dancing . first off , the happy hour special was pretty good ( i think buy one get one ) . my favorites on the list include * lychee martini * ginger sake martini * rock candy ( comes with a candy stick * alcoholic green tea .. all wonderfully blended , flavorful and will get you tipsy in no time . the atmosphere is clean and modern . the outdoor seating is beautiful and gives you a nice view of the strip . the indoor sushi bar is also nice and is structured in a way to allow you to interact with other people at the bar . i had a salad thing , that was ok , my non vegan friends have enjoyed just about everything here . i always try to come back when i am visiting faimly .
0	seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it 's so confusing which side to order from . just wanted a caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the `` hot '' side . i 'll just go to subway thanks .
0	i will not shop at this store again . while they do carry what i need - a prescription dog food needed for my dogs ' digestion problems - they refused to sell it to me without a `` prescription card , '' which i did not have because i just moved to charlotte and my new vet had not yet mentioned any such thing to me . it was a sunday and my vet 's office , like just about every other professional practice in charlotte , is closed on sundays . the kicker is that they sold it to my father two weeks earlier without a prescription so the problem is n't that they wo n't make an exception to their silly policy , but apparently that they just did n't want to make an exception for me . either way , it 's dog food ... and expensive dog food at that . do they think my dogs are going to become addicts or something ? no thanks , i wo n't be returning and giving them my money for all of the expensive dog food that i purchase on a regular basis . i will find another supplier .
0	refreshing adult milk shakes ? ! sign me up ! my friends and i checked this place out right after it opened . the lure of ice cream and alcohol on a warm afternoon was too enticing . in keeping in line with old town , this place is n't very big , but there 's tons of seating and booths . the dj was playing a funky retro mix , and the overall vibe was good . service , however , was not good . it took an hour to get 3 milkshakes and 6 glasses of water , and we had to ask for the water 3 times . i do n't get what 's up with people and water in this state ... seriously , this is the desert . people need to hydrate . i even tip for water .... just bring me a glass , do n't make me keep asking . needless to say , we decided not to stay . although the drinks were good , the service was way too slow . next time i think i 'll try a weekday ... maybe that will be better .
0	to be honest , i am surprised this show is still going on . it is a throwback to the old vegas days and it was nice to get a feel for that but i feel a 10 min sidewalk show could have done the same thing . the set , costumes , and choreography are all outdated and it was beyond apparent . like others have said the dancers seemed like they were bored and just going through the motions . if you can score free ( like i did ) or highly discounted tickets it is definitely worth it just to experience what old vegas might have been like .
1	this is hands down the best `` fine dining '' thai restaurant that i 've ever been to . it was conveniently located inside our hotel ( the aria ) and was priced pretty modestly . we started off with their awesome prawn rolls , shared a chillean seabass , a lobster fried rice ( was on their specials menu ) and duck penang curry . all of these entrees were amazing and they made them with just the right amount of spicyness . we asked for a 4/5 .... and we were sweating ever so slightly ... perfect : ) . we ordered every single drink on the cocktail menu , all of which were awesome . we opted not to get dessert , but our waiter was really nice and bought us a fried banana on the house . thanks for the lovely experience !
1	this was a great burger experience . i had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries . i called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because i was afraid that thy would be nasty cold . i was wrong ! my fiance had the sweet potato fries . they were still yummy once we got them home . i have driven by this place many times and will be back soon !
0	ugh . how do you spell depressing ? well , you abbreviate it , anyway , with the letters : t.i . as it 's called on the strip . do n't go here . it 's gross . everyone 's a slobbering mess . the dealer tried to take my bet in blackjack . that shit was a push . she realized her mistake and tried to pretend nothing happened . wow . if these were the golden days of vegas , i know just how i woulda dealt with her ... a nice knuckle sandwich in the `` back room . ''
1	bloody mary , amir , 70 degrees , kona and v-land ! ! ! ! perfect ! ! great happy hour selection , beautiful outdoor venue , great drinks , delish pad tai ! ! !
0	good value for fresh food fast and cheap however poor customer service is why i will only give this restaurant 2 stars . line staff was extremely rude and rushed order . i eat at other locations and knew exactly what i wanted and i still felt rushed ! ! ! also staff tried to give me a dime size portion of meat on a taco order . when i asked for a more adequate serving i received a serving of attitude instead !
0	to start this review off , let me just say that i am not really a fan of buffets in vegas . i 've never really preferred massive quantity for mediocre quality . that being said , i think wicked spoon is okay . we got there at 5pm on a saturday before the rush started , so you 'll do yourself a favor if you get there early . we chose to go early because who likes to be full of food when they go out later that night ? not me . the food was pretty decent . i tried the truffled potatos , the shrimp miso , spinach salad , and a few other choice items . all in all , not that bad . i did like the fact that they were also plated separately , which made it easier and gave points for presentation . but , presentation does n't make it for me entirely . some of the stuff was also a bit overcooked . the dessert were also a big draw for me to these types of things , i tried one of each and did n't really find anything that stood out as well . it was all packaged wonderfully though ( once again , points for presentation ) but to be honest , the only thing i really liked was the chocolate covered strawberries and the chocolate mousse/berry thing they had . the gelato was 'meh ' since it tasted like the typical gelato stuff . all in all , not bad , but i probably wont be spending $ 37.50 + tip for something like this again . i think although it is nice and everything , it is not worth $ 37.50 , hence it is only ok .
0	do not ever get takeout from here ! it is so poorly made , cold and way below standards . we live in the neighborhood and have eaten in the restaurant . the food is good but since we have a baby and a busy schedule , takeout is a great thing for us ... not here ! i have literally ordered the same thing dine in/take out and geez ! they just do n't give a damn ! seriously . it 's like they are trying to turn away customers
1	delicious sub ! ! i love how the turkey is shredded . tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor . my only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry because there was so much . if the dressing had been on the meat , it would have been perfect . way better than subway : )
0	i guess i 'm just spoiled from living in new mexico my whole life ( best mexican food ever ) . this place had been recommended to me by pretty much everyone when i told them i was looking for nm style mexican food . we finally made it here & i was stoked ! the girl behind the counter kept answering the phone while we were ordering , another worker was walking past us cursing at another employee ... awwwwwkward . now i 'm willing to look past all of that if the food is good , sadly disappointed does n't even begin to cover it . i ordered a carne asada chimichanga & my husband ordered the chorizo & potato combo plate . the food came out quickly & my husband could n't figure out what he was looking at on his plate . it was just ground beef on top of mashed potatoes . every place he 's ever been has served it with fried potatoes & actual chorizo . is this normal for az ? he did n't even want to eat it the food was so bland . i cut into my chimi & could n't believe the meat that was coming out of it ... boiled dry hamburger meat . this was absolutely not carne asada . i gave it a shot thinking that at least if it 's flavorful it wo n't matter . nope . bland , dry absolutely no flavor . the guacamole on top was great & the tortilla was n't heavy from being fried , it was nice & light . but what 's a chimi without yummy fillings ? ! i could n't even finish it , we both had weird artificial aftertastes in our mouths as we were leaving . blech . sorry , but this is a huge `` never again '' for me .
1	shockingly fun . it 's not a 'top tier ' club but it 's fun and all that matters . the drinks are n't outrageous ( by vegas standards ) , the music is 75 % edm , 25 % old school , which i like . it has a nice view of the water fountain , which is a nice touch . if you go fairly early , like until 11:30 , you 'll have no problem getting in , they 're not very selective for sure . i was surprised at how relaxed the dress code is . you can get in with a t-shirt and jeans . i wish they 'd up that a bit and they 'd find a higher level of clientele . the staff was friendly and patient with us drunks .
0	i made an appointment for someone to take a look at my roof . they were 15min late so i just left since this was for a rental . they called me later and said i did n't need to be there , which was not what i was told by the person who set up the appointment in the first place . so this was on the 16th and sure its the holidays , but why does it take this long to drum up a bid ? so i sent a message through the website to which i did n't receive any response . then i called and an answering service took a message saying they were open that day and would call me back . i 've pretty much given up on this company at this point . : /
0	i booked this hotel with the hopes of a relaxing weekend by the four pools . i booked through perfect escapes because of the free room upgrad and early check in . when my boyfriend and i arrived at the hotel , we were told it would be 30-60 min before our room was ready . not a huge deal , so we had the bell desk hold our bags and decided to check out the pool area . as soon as we walked outside we hear extremely loud jackhammering going on . they were using jackhammers at what looked like two of the four pools . it was so loud we could stand side by side and not hear each other and it stirred up so much dust it was hard to see . we immediately asked inside how long it would be going on . they then told us it would be going on the entire weekend until 4 p.m. each day . there was no indication of construction on the resort website or perfect escapes . disappointing after $ 45 cab ride to the resort and then another $ 45 cab ride to another resort after then paying to use the hotel internet to find another resort . i go to the phoenix area often and have staid at camelback inn , hyatt gainey ranch and hotel indigo . all were wonderful accomodations . from the look of this hotel on several websites , it was quite beautiful and relaxing and very comparable to the other resorts in the area . unfortunately , i never even made it to the room due to the construction . it was not the relaxing weekend i had planned for . the construction should have been disclosed on all websites linked to the hotel .
1	i wish we would have spent more time on fremont street when we came to vegas . i felt a lot more comfortable here then on the strip . its an interesting mix of street performers , historical sites , and new technology . its a little seedy , but the strip has a little seedy too . we took public transportation there and while cheaper , it took forever . we took a cab back and it was a much more enjoyable experience . i liked the vibe of the restaurants and bars here . everything is more affordable . things are less opulent and less clean , but a lot more comfortable . i like the throw back vibe to everything , it felt like stepping back in time . nobody here takes themselves too seriously as it is vegas after all . i really liked the restaurants and bar here , there are some very nice restaurants , but again cheaper then the strip and with a more historical ambiance . the video screen is very cool too !
1	great deal for breakfast/lunch . the food was amazing and there were lots of lighter delicious options so you were n't eating straight heavy fat . go here !
0	3.5 stars you will not find very authentic food here but close for a fast casual restaurant . what se\u00f1or taco does well is give you huge portions , a good bang for the buck . the two items i really enjoy off their menu is the chilaquiles platter that is enough food for two and their carne asada fries which my daughter and i share and still leave food behind . since the girls who work the counter recognize us we are given great customer service but do notice this is not the case all the time and is a area to improve . the kitchen is n't the fastest all the time but the flavor and portions are always the same . if you 're planning on arriving with a party of 5 or more seating is limited . they mainly have booths and a few tables that seat 4 max . you will not pay a lot of money here for your meal and should have a good selection of items to choose from to appease most folks .
1	this is a great local place for the neighborhood . there are n't many general shops or convenience stores within walking distance , so rolliers is my go-to store . their employees ( beyond the local teens at the registers ) are very friendly and knowledgeable . i 've never had any problems finding plumbing , storage , or cleaning supplies .
1	i truly enjoyed the meal i had there . i went in for lunch and it was delicious , i had the manila clams to start , and the fettuccine w/ shrimp and bay scallops . the tilapia was also nicely done also . over all the service was great and i had a great time . really want to try some more dishes . until next time !
0	the view was spectacular and the whole experience was amazing . i only give it 3 stars because i did n't think the food measured up to the price . however , i think what you 're paying for is the experience . i 'm glad i went once , but i probably would n't go back .
1	i have been ordering food from rainbow garden for ten years . their food is delicious , it 's always hot , and delivery is fast ! my husband loves the crab rangoon , and i do n't think i 've ever had a dish i did n't like . rainbow garden is also a great spot for lunch . they have the usual lunch special : soup , spring roll and entree with rice for $ 6- $ 8 . the lunch specials are a great value , however they only include the common/popular chinese restaurant dishes such as general tso 's , princess , garlic sauce , etc . if you want something different , you have to order off of the full menu . but the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh . i 'm a fan .
0	obviously great selection of rebel merchandise but outrageous prices . seriously , the prices are almost twice what they should be . why does the same hat cost $ 30 here , $ 20 at the ballgame , and $ 16 online from the manufacturer ? but ... if you want nice rebelbilia , they 've got stuff here that no one else carries . bring a few quarters for parking .
1	i love trying out new places to eat so my boyfriend surprised me with dinner here for our anniversary . we sat in the booth area where they played live music but if you prefer more of an intimate dinner there is seating on the other side of the restaurant where it 's more quiet . we started off with the sweet chilli calamari which was different but delicious ! ! ! i had the sea scallops with parmesan risotto and my boyfriend got the blackened swordfish with cornbread and jalape\u00f1o tartar . the main dishes do n't come with sides so we also got a side of the black truffle mac and cheese . i personally did n't care for it . i normally love mac and cheese but the taste was blah and it was over priced . overall we enjoyed our first experience at the restaurant .. i liked that it was n't super packed and the service was good . the price of the food is a bit over priced but was expected .
1	we turned off our water heater during our vacation and when he came back we dont know how to turned it on . i called several co left a message to call me back but none of them called back except for mario . i told him the situation and he helped me over the phone as a courtesy . now that 's a wow ! ! ! ! he did n't mind spending time helping me over the phone with no charge , you will never see that kind of courtesy at all . mario thank you again ! ! ! i will definitely call you and recommend you to anyone .
1	i visited this store the other day and spoke with a gentleman named jerry that worked in the store . i was looking for one day bus passes and he stated that they only sell 15 and 30 day bus passes . he proceeded to let me know where i can go to get these bus passes at several places and was so nice about it . anyone that goes above and beyond to help someone out that did n't purchase a thing in the store , gets 5 stars in my book ! thank you jerry for the helpful information .
0	the tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they ca n't be bothered to deal with you , but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when i 'm having cravings .
1	the best lunch spot in charlotte . friendly , family atmosphere . great food , exceptional service !
1	had lunch there this sunday , and we liked the experience . i was n't impressed by the d\u00e9cor , but did n't bother me either : as long as it 's clean , i 'm fine with it . i care more about the food and the service : ) the field greens salad was simple and nice and the bf loved the lobster bisque . we shared the vodka pasta , and even though it looked small , it was just enough food for the two of us .
1	best sandwiches i have ever had ! ! ! i eat here every time i 'm in vegas . i was in vegas last week for three days and went every single day . their tuna melt is out of this world -- ask them to add mustard to it -- yum ! the bread is killer and it 's only $ 5.95 for any sandwich and open 24 hours . i 'm never up early enough for breakfast which is only served until 11am ( why is it always like that in vegas ? ! ? who is up that early in vegas ? ) but i 'm dying to try it !
1	i 've previously used beauty to beauty . my daughter ( now 8 years old ) and i had our hair cut by leah sometime last year . she did an very good job . it was by appointment , she worked fast with complete attention to detail . we were both very happy with the results . yesterday was our second visit to beauty to beauty ( i do a pretty bad job of getting haircuts regularly ) . this time i decided to skip the appointment and do a walk-in . it was no problem at all , my daughter was getting her hair washed within 5 minutes of arriving . our stylist was kathy , she was excellent . she was great with my daughter , very attentive . she listened to our hair concerns and went to work . kathy delivered haircuts that addressed all our concerns and then some . i am ecstatic with her work and highly recommend her . very easy going and delivers what you want , not afraid to give an honest opinion . i am paranoid when it comes to getting my hair cut , but i would definately go back to kathy and give her free reign , it 's a shame i am moving in a couple weeks , i hope i am lucky enough to find a good stylist after the move . for both visits we had shampoos , cuts , blow-outs , and some straightening , which all came to $ 60 . very reasonably priced in my opinion . i 've been to other salons who charge well over $ 100 for just me alone . not sure about some of the bad reviews . i am pretty picky when it comes to great value and friendly service . if your looking for a great price , a wonderful haircut , a fast and friendly service , this is the place to go ! not to mention it 's in chinatown so we can grab some pho and boba tea after .
0	this place is terrible . the whole idea of the place is dumb ; i 'm not paying overpriced prices for bad service , bad jokes , and to be seated on a bench with other couples . i left before i ordered .
0	close to downtown if that is where you need to be . cheap room . terrible food from room service , raw steak full of grizzle .
0	ok , it 's harrah 's . and it used to be the flagship of harrah 's properties in vegas but now it 's kind of middle of the road . since ceasar 's is their flagship property , larger and more luxurious but harrahs ' will do in a pinch . i 've had a few stays at total rewards properties ( ceasars/harrah 's ) recently . although an older property , and probably not the most luxurious of the caesars entertainment properties , it 's surefire , and smack dab in the middle of the strip action . right across street from ceasars , their forum shops , across street from mirage , next door to the quad ( soon to become the linq hotel and casino and not soon enough ) and short walk to flamingo . i stayed in the carnival tower by choice because the room was sizeably bigger than the mardi gras tower , but it was an older room . it will be remodeled eventually i 'm told . my friends stayed in the mardi gras tower , which have mini balconies , are non-smoking , and usually have awesome poolside views . the location of that tower is a little closer to the casino and strip as well . but i had a minor upgrade to the high roller view room , i think , and it had an awesome view of the new high roller attraction ( worlds tallest ferris wheel temporarily ) . there are many different types of rooms and suites available in both towers , and the property is pet friendly . my room was always kept really clean , and i was pretty surprised at the friendliness of the housekeeping staff . minibar unstocked ....... left empty . could see where a mini fridge had been removed and my shower head had a small leak . but noise did n't affect me and who wants to pay exhorbitant prices for minibar stuff anyway . downstairs they had several shops , well stocked for normal hotel shops , including clothing , to usual gift shop , to fair selection of alcohol . casino is a little outdated . an absurd kitsch statute of an older couple right in the middle of the entrance from the hotel to the casino that is comical and looks `` comic '' like , too . no problems with any staff members whatsoever , everyone 's always been very friendly . especially security staff , who were plentiful , and total rewards staff , along with check in . but i 'm a little lucky there since i get to use the platinum/diamond check in which is separate from the general check-in lines ........ thereby avoiding quite a wait . if i had any complaint at all it was at check out when the clerk had a hard time explaining how my points were deducted to pay my room charges . but we worked it out . and the cashier personnel were very , very helpful and accommodating . and they remembered you , too ! fairly large casino , a little plain for me , but like i said they are in the process of remodeling the entire property in parts . new food court coming . but thought the games were a little stingy . too many 6-5 blackjack tables ......... do not play 6-5 blackjack ....... that is not real blackjack . but they also had regular 3-2 blackjack with good rules , though the table limits were a little higher . other amenities or restaurants include a gourmet burger place , called kerry 's i think , a toby keith love this bar and grill , flavor 's buffet was very good , very good servers , but a little overpriced for a vegas buffet .......... my price was over $ 20 , which i thought was a little high . starbucks abound . both floors . and there is a monorail station on the second floor , too . outdoor carnival court that was rocking on weekend . but though this place used to have a mardi gras theme , i think it 's lost that feel . nice piano lounge near one of the entrances . fat ( or big ? ) elvis impersonator . pic reflected . had a great `` cover voice '' and you should have seen all the older folks dancing to his music and having a good time ! for the price i paid ( total rewards partially comped ) it 's a great place , price and location .
0	nice small caf\u00e9 shop with machine sales on the side . but as for coffee .... not many choices & tasted bad .
1	the breakfast menu is excellent . our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great . it 's definitely a place i would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion .
0	i 'm going to revise my original post after going on the maricopa.gov restaurant inspection list . it appears shimogamo has a few citations for not keeping their fish at the appropriate temperature of below 41 degrees . in fact , these citations say it was up to 54 degrees . as someone who checks the maricopa.gov site regularly on these restaurant checks , i know that there are some citations that are really stupid ( for example - they got cited for not putting the `` consuming raw fish etc is bad for your health '' . duh , it 's a sushi restaurant . but , raw fish storage to me is important , since that 's how many people get sick from sushi restaurants . as much as i liked this place , i am going to hold off a couple months until the next inspection to make sure this is n't re-occuring .
0	i would n't even give this one star but no star is n't an option . you get approached by them asking , `` would you like great deals on shows or dinner ? `` - that 's their sales pitch , right ? but of course you know it 's about a time share . and you tell them you 're not interested but the person presenting you your deals about discounted show tickets and dinner is extremely friendly - `` just compare your hotel to our resort , only a 90 min presentation . you get a nice lunch ( not- old subs sitting there the whole day and a bag of chips ) and we 'll hook you up with all these shows or a dinner and $ 100 '' . we made the biggest mistake and gave in ! ! you get set up with a sales person , ours was samuel and he was friendly in the beginning but you tell them you 're not interested and he became extremely rude . i regret not reporting him to a manager or someone above him about the way he treated us after we said no to signing up for a timeshare . after saying no repeatedly , he told us `` well you 're not going to find anything for $ 1 , you only came here for show tickets '' , as if we were even interested in a timeshare in vegas in the first place ! and yes we were there for discounted show tickets ! your initial sales pitch to getting anyone to listen to your presentation on your timeshare resort are discounted tickets to shows ! why is this a shock ? ! buying a timeshare is not a decision you make over a 3 hr presentation ! yes , they will keep you way over 90min . it pretty much ruined our day just because they treat you like shit when you do n't sign up for a timeshare . they were so rude - even a manager said `` ugh , just give them their tickets and get them out of here '' . resort was nice but just based on how we were treated , i would n't recommend anyone to westgate resort- at least not getting suckered into this situation like we were .
0	the mgm garden arena has to be about 20 years old . my sister and i went to see miley cyrus on a saturday night . i am gon na write this review in pros and cons list style . pros : -really not a bad seat in the house . -amazing acoustics for live music . -has a large capacity . -drinks/concessions are ridiculously over priced . -clean facility . -friendly staff . cons : -there is no easy way to the arena . it is a trek . i usually would n't complain , but recovering from surgery , i can complain . so , keep that in mind . -the stadium seating is killer on the legs . i am 5'10 '' , when the lady sat down in the seat in front of me , her seat back dug into my shins . i am only 5'10 '' people . i had to sit side saddle to sit semi-comfortably . -the ushers are a little older ( okay , a lot , it 's a sign of the economic times ) and did little/nothing to help a way too inebriated ( barely , if legal age ) fellow meandering up and down the stairs - as soon as the show was over ( i 'm the type to stay seated until the masses clear out ) , i was urged to get up and get out . i had to make a run to the ladies and i was met with silver curtain and was denied entrance to restroom . i get that 11 pm may be past their bed time but they should n't close the restrooms as soon as the performance was over . i have seen many great shows here bette midler , britney spears , madonna , nsync , aerosmith , no doubt , elton john , and the list goes on ... for that , the mgm will always hold awesome memories , but the staff in the joint dinged it a star and the arena could for sure use an update to 20 .
1	nice for lunch and dinner , and fast enough for a work lunch . i got the heirloom tomato & wood roasted corn salad with salmon added ; delicious ! the spiced watermelon and pickled radish in the salad are so good - never had watermelon or radish that way . service was quick , and we sat at a hightop near the open terrace . they serve yaka mein , which i saw on anthony bourdain or andrew zimmern ( i forget ) once , which i am definitely going to try soon .
1	we stayed here after getting an awesome deal on priceline for $ 90 per night . i admit that if i 'd paid full price i 'd have been a little annoyed at the size of the room . it felt pretty small , but it was comfortable and had a great view of heinz field . it 's also a fantastic location . we were able to walk almost everywhere , which i always enjoy when spending time in a new city . the hotel itself is beautiful , especially in the lobby . it 's a historic hotel and really managed to keep the aesthetics of the original interior but update them in appropriate ways . i would recommend avoiding the restaurant if you can . as with all hotel restaurants it was overpriced , and the breakfast we ate there was unmemorable to say the least .
1	this is one place i have been wanting to go to for a long time . everything m & m 's and lots of it . if you are a huge m & m 's fan or love only one color then this is a must for your vegas vacation . i got a yellow m & m 's luggage tag and i love it . ice cream , and m & m 's candy of all varieties ever made , take all you want but be prepared to pay up . stuffed characters , banks , name straps , clothing , and even the actual m & m 's race car on the 4th floor , and yes you are not seeing things , there are 4 floors of everything m & m 's . so next time your are in vegas try this place out , it rocks .
0	i guess i did n't get the memo , but once i realized sushi koma was a play on sushi `` coma '' , i was completely enamored at the genius of the name . sometimes when i eat here , i still ca n't believe how dumb i was not to realize it . in any case , sushi koma is a solid ayce sushi option on the westside . parking is plentiful , but seating is not . you are a bit cramped and close to other tables . we had a table for 8 here and had to maneuver a lot to get in and out of our seats , so for larger parties i 'd recommend oyshi instead . one thing i do appreciate about sushi koma over other ayce places is they have yet to mess up my order and food does come out fairly quickly . i 'm never worried if they forgot to put an order in . i just tried their hand rolls for the first time last week , and i 'm definitely a fan . their sushi i would say is a bit lesser in quality and freshness than sushi house goyemon , but still solid . i think they inflate the prices for non-ayce so it 's always better to just go ahead and get ayce . i wish they had a few more interesting dessert options than ice cream and mochi , but at the end , i 'm always too stuffed to eat a big dessert anyway . my husband is a fan of the big b roll - baked sushi roll topped with beef , while my favorite baked roll is the volcano roll .
1	avec un ami , nous y avons pass\u00e9 une journ\u00e9e de r\u00eave . le terrain est parfaitement entretenu et il fut tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able de s ' y promener , au travers des diff\u00e9rents jardins .
0	must 've caught eddie and co on a bad night . aloof service made more so by our order of mostly small plates ... even tho the menu is ideal for such a meal ( and it ups the tab ) . all four plates arrived at the same time , too big for the table ! just wrong and so uninspired . as we emptied and consolidated plates to make room , the empties stacked up and festered for a long time until i took out my camera . suddenly a hand appeared in frame and removed them . specifics : the much lauded shrimp/potato/horseradish app is not so great . way too much crust around a smallish shrimp . even when i dissected one , it was hard to discern the flavors and textures . the mac n cheese is excellent . large noodles and great cheese taste and texture ... as good as there is in the purist category . cobb salad , large but unremarkable . seafood wontons , okay but unable to tell you what seafood we were eating ... pasty that way . ahi app ( poke style ) , good fish , decent seasoning . no reason to return . but if ur in the nabe , check it out . maybe they 'll be having a better night
1	a friend and i recently ended up here before going to the katy perry concert at mandalay bay . we had initially planned on dinner at burger bar , but that was a bust when we found out there was a one hour wait and tummy 's were a rumbling ! enter r\u00ed r\u00e1 . i was n't sure what to expect ... but to be honest , at the time , i did n't care as i was starving . because there was also a wait at the pub , we ended up sitting at the bar . go figure . oh my , was i pleasantly surprised ! i had the irish potato cakes ( ok , i 'm an appetizer kind of gal ) , and they were soooooooo good . i love potatoes ( hence , my obsession with french fries ) , and the cakes were soft , but not mushy , and had just the right amount of saltiness with the balsamic glaze . i also had the chips and malt vinegar mayo ( yeah , ok , there was a bit of potato overload ) . the mayo was de-li-cious ! a nice contrast with the chips and change of pace from ketchup . i was so stuffed i decided not to have an entree . the drinks department also did not disappoint . my friend had some beers and i had a couple of dark and stormy 's , which i 'm not used to seeing on menus that often . the drinks were good , not too strong . best of all , our bartender/server was irish and fun to chat with . i agree that the pub is noisy , but in a good way . this is not somewhere you 'd go to catch up with a long lost friend ; it 's somewhere you 'd go to have fun with a smaller group of fun people . but the best part was that as a local , i got to sign up for a `` green card . '' the green card equates to a 20 % discount off food/drinks for locals . yay for discounts and yay for locals !
0	i 've ordered to go before . and the dish i ordered was great . but today i ordered delivery which took an hour to get here and their website says `` within 45 minutes '' . i also ordered the bbq pork with mixed vegetables . the meat was tuff and the pork was not bbq ! i can make real chinese bbq pork so i know what it tastes like . it was more like tuff boiled pork . tasteless ! i will give them another chance . but will not order any pork from there .
0	a girlfriend and i came here after seeing their groupon ( 13 $ for 20 $ ) .... when we arrived the restaurant was packed inside and out , but the hostess seated us very quickly . we were super thirsty from too much pool/champagne time and it felt like days before we even got water ( i would guess 15-20 minutes .. which is still quite a lot ) . after we ordered it took another 45 minutes or so for the food to come out- again , pretty crazy since most of the options are breakfast themed . how long does it take to cook an egg ? i had the chicken salad sandwich and mexican soup .. the soup was so salty it was almost inedible , but compared tot he super super bland chicken salad sandwich , . i guess i was happy it was at least seasoned . there was so little chicken salad on the sandwich that after taking the top peice of bread off , then the bottom , i literally had 2 bites from each side . no exaggeration . someone had taken the time to dice the apples and other ingredients into perfect tiny cubes , which shows tons of effort ... but the super small portion given and the fact that it was n't seasoned made all that work seem pointless . my friend had the corn beef hash .. she left most of it- absolutely no seasoning again . it was the blandest corned beef hash i 've ever tasted . she also had a chai tea- again , no flavor , so she was dumping sugar and such into it trying to pep it up . we spent another 15 minutes trying to get the bill- then did the universal my tab is sitting halfway over the edge of the table so the waitress will see it move ... and she still did n't see it , so i had to flag her down . i would say she was friendly , but overall poor service for the long wait time . by the time we got our plates , most of the restaurant was empty , so it 's not like they were in the middle of a rush .
1	love this place ! ! ! excellent service even when swamped ! food ready & fresh on revolving server . : )
0	i have dogs and they are my babies , so i understand the love for dogs , but i could n't really get a feel for this store . it does have some cute stuff for dogs but most things were not suitable for bigger dogs , so i thought . very cute if you have a dog obsession and it was nice to walk around and look at stuff , but nothing too practical i would actually buy for my dogs . you might love it though , so go check it out .
0	for starters , the original stromboli is awesome . but , do yourself a favor and order it to go . i love a good dive bar , but this is pushing it . the 3 decade old carpet saves all of the years past odors . we were served but an absolutely charming older asian woman . we loved her . but as the place got busier , the charm level fell . took a good 10 min to pick up my card to pay the bill . that 's really one of my biggest pet peeves while dining . and the beer selection .... i get it , it 's a hole in the wall . but can you at least carry sierra nevada ? heineken is never an acceptable `` good '' beer option . the food is great though . too bad they share any association with guy fieri . that dude is beyond irritating .
1	i 'm very happy that i discovered this place . la maison thai offers great thai food , desserts & bubble teas . there is no waiter service here . food is placed under glass at the counter and whatever you like is served to you on a tray and you seat yourself . the place is nice inside , nothing too special . the staff is very kind , helpful and attentive . the food is fresh , hot , yummy , the portions are generous and the prices are just right . i tried the shrimp pad thai , shrimp rolls and shrimp dumplings . the pad thai was great with a good amount of shrimps . the shrimp rolls were good too , but slightly on the oily side . also , the shrimp dumplings were yum and i loved the sauce it came with . i was craving their bubble tea but did not get to have one since the large portion of the pad thai filled me up- i could not finish all of it ! this is a good thai place if you 're looking for a nice informal meal or takeout .
0	1st off the decor of the restaurant was nice and the staff was friendly . the restaurant itself was smaller than i thought it would be and had 2 main dining areas . it was pretty busy when we went but did n't seem overcrowded like in most dim sum restaurants . the food at ppp is decent . we had the dim sum staples like har gow , shaomai , beef balls and fried shrimp balls . nothing really stood out from the dishes we had . in addition there did n't seem to be too much variety in the dishes . we had asked the servers if the chinese broccoli and sesame balls were coming out and they said soon . 3 passes later with the carts and those 2 dishes were mia . and this is at 12 during the middle of lunch ? i did n't get it . one other thing that was a turn off is the fact that it is located in the casino and is open where you are exposed to the smoke lingering from the casino . i have to say that i was a little disappointed after eating here . i had heard such good reviews on it but in the end i would have rather have eaten at orchids garden . it was a nice change but i would have to say that i will not be back .
1	excellent tapas ! i am picky and i think i 've tried more than half the menu and every dish has been outstanding . the sangria is also very tasty ... i ended up drinking almost an entire pitcher last time i went ! the line is usually out the door and parking is limited . the restaurant is next to the popular ruth 's chris steak house and a few other restaurants . makes parking a hassle as the lot in front of the businesses gets filled quickly . there is parking behind ruth 's chris and a walkway from the back parking lot to the front but it is a bit hidden . firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .
0	if i was a local i would probably love this place . its like cheers everyone knows your name . we had planned an impromptu hh here and arrived before anyone else . the soccer match was on so most of the tables were filled and a nice stranger offered us seats with him until something opened up . hh here seams to be popular with people who live in the neighborhood . we got a grande pitcher of sangria ( $ 25 ) and an order of nachos.the sangria was just ok and had a little too much ice and fruit . the nachos were strange i was not a fan . the vegetarian `` chill '' had little flavor and they used mozzarella cheese very weird . the beer list was pretty legit and they offer some specials featuring rum , vodka and gin . i would put this bar in the dive bar category and transplant this place to nolibs where it rightfully belongs .
0	this is the first and only showmars i 've visited . there are about 20 of them in the charlotte area . food was pretty good . i 'd give it one half step-up from a burger at a fast food joint . i had a greek salad ; the salad ( especially the chicken ) was tasty but the dressing was `` totally bleh '' . thankfully the default dressing was on the side so i asked for blue cheese dressing and it was much better -- they had ken 's dressing in a package . my dinner mates had a burger and fish and chips . all around `` ok '' . i 'd not go out of my way to go again and certainly not worth a quest ...
0	this place is terrible ! being a native nyer , i was excited to find a deli labeled `` real ny deli '' . this is the equivalent to a super shitty , dirty bronx bodega or road-side `` deli '' in some po-dunk upstate ny town . this is no `` ny deli '' . the meats were over processed crap , bathroom was among the dirtiest i 've ever seen any where in the world . on the positive , the people seemed nice & it 's cheap . totally disappointed .
0	as you descend the two flights from mandalay bay 's main concourse to aureole you are stuck by the tower of wine in the center of the staircase , a promise this michelin rated place will be worth the price . reception is more efficient than welcoming and you are soon escorted to your table . for such an apparently sophisticated locale dress is remarkably casual . my coat and tie were in the minority , as was my touch of gray hair . we have been there twice and both times the clientele was predominantly 20 and 30-somethings and in shirt sleeves and fashionable jeans . ask for a table in the back near the waterfall and swan pond . the wine list is indeed impressive , but is presented on what must be the original pad computer . it requires a stylus , is balky and is as non-intuitive as can be . come with an idea of what wine you want and insist the sommelier operate the damn thing for you before she slips away . service overall was excellent though it was valentine 's day evening and the place was packed . we both ordered fish , perhaps not the specialties of the house . the swordfish in citrus with vegetables was beautifully presented . the root vegetables were partially peeled with the skins tied into butterfly wings . the fish was only good by comparison . the red snapper , characterized by our waiter as flaky , was under cooked and flavorless . it was presented on a bacon infused bed of vegetables that were much better than the fish . the side of root vegetables was uniquely spiced and delicious . the star of the meal was the onion soup , presented under a pastry shell the waiter cut open . excellent . for such a highly rated restaurant the evening was disappointing .
0	terrible service . very unprofessional would never go back . chose a different location in the epicentre if you want a good time and to be treated well .
0	i really want to like zoe 's kitchen . i do . i really , really do . i have been to zoe 's more than 5 but less than 10 times , and yesterday was my last visit , unless i want to stop in for some limeade and chocolate cake . i have tried many things at zoes , and i try to listen to what others like .... i do n't like their bread at all , so every sandwich i 've had has been bad . the quesadilla is ok , but i 'm not a big fan of flour tortillas . the chicken roll ups ( i think that 's what it 's called ) that i had yesterday ( after a good friend 's recommendation ) were kind of soggy and yuck-o . i do n't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice .... do you see my challenge here ? the decor is adorable , and i really want to love the place , but i think i 've paid my very last visit to zoes . so , so sad !
0	going with low expectations , it was a quite ok experience . yes , it 's a chain . the food is nice , the service was ok , and i have nothing to complain about beside finding it slightly overpriced ( but then again it 's st catherine and even though there are a lot of good choices there , the bad options are not lacking )
1	sure there 's lots of cheese places in wisconsin and you ca n't miss on many of them . this one goes out of its way to get noticed . as you head west on i90/94 past madison , near deforest , you see a tall sign that reads `` cheese '' and a mouse dressed in oktoberfest attire climbing up the sign . this mouse was our reason to check it out . according to their postcard , the mouse is 14 feet tall . now that 's a big rodent ! anyway , the shop has a wide selection of cheeses , cheese curds , and meats that complement the cheese . there 's also some jams , honeys , and crafted items for sale . the bathroom is clean and the staff is helpful . clearly , their business thrives on passing tourists like us who come for the mouse and bite on the cheese later .
1	there are n't enough good things i can say about popo 's . my husband and i are locals who have the choice of dozens upon dozens of mexican restaurants , and we always choose popo 's . we do n't even consider going anywhere else . the food is awesome , the prices are very reasonable , and the service is great . it 's where we take our out-of-town guests , where we celebrate any occasion , and its always the choice for `` let 's do lunch '' . they have recently opened a location at 59th ave & bell and the food is exactly the same . hubby likes the enchiladas and , me , i 'm a machaca girl myself . go there ! you wo n't be sorry !
1	i understand that they have a new manager . seems like an energetic individual . the food was very good and was served quickly . i would give it a try .
1	wow .... has this corner of sunnyslope changed ! 10 years ago i worked in an office building across the street , at an internet startup . the day we moved in , there was a double homicide at the circle k on dunlap and central . after that , i brought my baseball bat to work every day , because i usually did n't leave until late at night when crack zombies congregated in the parking garage below the building . i called it `` louis , '' my coworker called it ( very un-pc ) the ethnic cleanser . now .... the ghetto elements are gone , and there is a wonderful wine bar with an even better patio . we put down a bottle of the rose - it was very , very tasty and drinkable . we went on a sunday , all they serve then is their breakfast menu . well ... it rocked . i had the veggie and cheese omelette , my guest had the chorizo wrap . both were superb ! the service was attentive , the ambiance was awesome both indoors and outdoors . the patio is shaded by some giant mesquites , with comfortable couch and chair seating . i 'll be back ! especially for the goat and sheep cheese plate , and to try some of the rest of their fantastic wine selection . ole !
1	this is my new favorite dim sum place in las vegas . first experience , went with my parents . the wait for a table was maybe 10 minutes as i went during prime time for lunch ( around 12pm ) . after i was seated at my table , i ordered the usual things you 'd usually get when you go dim sum . siu mai , steamed chicken feet , and sticky rice wrapped w/ lotus leaves . very fresh , flavored well , and steaming hot ! when even i say hot , its hot . the chicken feet were flavored well . not over seasoned , though tendons still a little chewy ( could have used a few more minutes in the steamer ) but still pretty well done . the pork siu mai was topped with some masago ( capelin roe ) . steaming hot . flavor was good . the pork was `` chewy '' , not in a bad sense but it has a slight resistance that shows it was made properly . there is a fairly decent size shrimp piece in there as well , that was not over cooked . the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was nice . wrapped normally with a few lotus leaves . did not fall apart as i was taking the leaves off . flavored well , good amount of ingredients inside the sticky rice . after a few other items were ordered , ranging from a few different buns , shrimp rice noodle , pan fried chives dumpling , and egg tarts . there were two types of buns i had ordered . one was called ( directly translated ) leaking sand bun which was made with i believe a salted egg yolk mixture which when you pull apart the bun , the rich , egg yolk mixture oozes out . perfectly made . that 's the result you 'd look for when you get this bun . hot from the oven , before the bun itself soaks up this yolk mixture . very delicious . the other bun ( directly translated ) is called the snow mountain bun . has a white crust on top with i believe a lotus filling . very good . nice and hot off the cart . the shrimp rice noodle was well-made also . good thickness to the noodle and a good sized shrimp lined in the middle of the noodle , topped with a soy sauce that was prepared to be slightly sweet . the pan fried chives dumping is one of my favorite items to get . parts of the outer skin layer crispy due to the pan fried technique while the size is still nice and soft . the filling had ample amounts of chinese chives , shrimp , and pork . seasoned really well , not overpowering the natural tastes of the chives or meats . last but not least , is the egg tarts .. fresh out of the oven , nice flaky golden crust with a glimmering , shiny egg filling in the middle . the crust was warm and flaky but still unable to taste the butter ? they use to create the flaky crust mixed with a bite of the the slightly sweet egg center . one of the many favorite dim sum items or snack items among the chinese communities . unfortunately this was my first meal , so i didnt get to order much before i was stuffed . i will not hesitate to come back again for another round of dim sum . a little suggestion , try going with 4-6 people in your party if you want to try a good amount of the dishes they offer during lunch . lunch is served between 10 am and 3 pm . do n't hesitate to go early or late ! they will specially prepare the item of your choice even if you do n't see it available on the cart . the prices are very reasonable , especially considering this restaurants sits inside the rio casino & resort . the prices are as followed : small : $ 2.28 medium : $ 3.18 large : $ 3.98 special : $ 4.98 * edit * i went again recently . one thing to note was the service was quite lacking . forgotten orders or took a while to serve us .
1	this is a fantastic school . i am puzzled by f.n . review . from what i read this person has not had a child attend this school . i think it would be impossible to judge the quality of education by simply walking thru the halls . i have two children at this school . both of them started at pre k. they have not only have received a world class eduction , but they have had no problem socially or physically . the teachers and administration are highly qualified and nurturing at the same time . there is not a better school in the valley .
1	i ate here because they have all you can eat crab legs on wednesday and thursday . on a night like this i would expect a full house and line . the restaurant was busy but there was never a line . i like that i did n't have to fight the crowd to get some crab . they also had a salad bar , meat , fish , mashed potatoes , baked potatoes , sweet and sour chicken , chow mein , tacos , hush puppies , and rolls . the crab legs and tri tip were great and the rest of the food was okay . we left completely satisfied and ca n't wait to go back .
0	a couple of things to do : - drink beer at the bar - watch sports - ride the mechanical bull - and stay away from the food . the food was not good . i got the diablo chicken pasta . although the warning messages on the menu about the dangers of eating meat was a pleasant reminder , it did not deter me from it . the diablo chicken pasta tasted bland , mixed with penne pasta , some crushed peppers , and a mac n cheese taste . i love mac n cheese , but this was no bueno . especially for 14.95 ! ! ! it was n't spicy and overall it was just a terrible dish . aside from that , the sandwiches also looked mundane . one item i would suggest is the mushroom lovers pizza . that is if you love mushroom and flatbread pizza . this is definitely the kind of place where the environment and style undermines the food . the service was good . in fact , it was toooo good . a person would come and check on us every three-five minutes . first the manager , than another waitress , then our waitress . afterwords , she came again and asked `` how we were . '' i do n't mind the intrusion , it was just a little too much and annoying . overall ... b- great environment and unsatisfactory food .
0	i do n't know where to begin with this review . i guess it started when us airways stranded us until 2:15 am in honolulu with a 3 year old and no offer of support or compensation due to a flight member needing some more sleep time . you know , we could have all used some more sleep time . unfortunately , we had to pay for an extra night of hotel , but us airways did not think they had to reimburse us , despite the delay not being due to weather and was on their end . so , they gave us each $ 100 voucher codes for a future flight - so we could apparently get the same bad service again . what i received was worse . an attempt 2 months later to follow their instructions by calling reservations and trying to book us on a vacation flight to phoenix became an act in futility when the call got dropped at least 4 times using 2 separate phones . the last attempt got me the closest of making the reservation , but then the so-called customer service rep told me they were having trouble with their system and to call back in 5-10 minutes . excuse me ? i 'll say you 're having trouble with your system . why do n't you call me back when it 's fixed ? ? ? the next day , i started over from scratch . i wanted to use the vouchers for my wife and daughter , but i wanted to fly with them using dividend miles . after a pain-stakingly long time with richard on the phone , we finally get them squared away , but then he tells me i will have to call back to the dividend miles extenstion to make my reservation . what ? not even a `` let me transfer you over to the dividend miles '' folks ? ? ? so i play their game . i call back and figure out which options to press to make a dividend miles reservation . guess who i get . that 's right , richard . hello again , hello . we go through another painstakingly long process of getting me booked , but at least he has my billing information so i do n't have to repeat it . we get almost to the end and i asked for our seating assignments to all be in row 19 , seats d , e , and f for both flights . richard said `` no problem '' . later that day , when i go to check our reservations , the outbound flight to phoenix has us in row 19 as i asked , but the return flight still has us in row 14. so , i had to go into the system and change our seat assignments ( thank goodness i could do that on-line and not have to make another stressful call ) . here is something even funnier : instead of two $ 100 vouchers if us airways had given us the one night at the hotel , the cost would have been $ 215 . yes , $ 15 more than what they ended up giving us . $ 15 to keep a family of 3 satisfied instead of making us go through these painful processes and ticking us off and away from them forever . i sincerely doubt anyone from us air cares what i think , how i was treated through this entire process , or will read this . but for those of you who have a choice in who you choose as your airline carrier , do not choose u.s. scare ! friends do n't let friends fly us airways . they are not worth yours or anyone else 's business . america west was at one time a pretty good airline . i flew with them a fair amount . us air has managed to sink that company to an all-time low by bringing in their practices on how an airline should be run , which is to say , `` f-you , just give us your money . ''
1	lunch on the patio also amazing . ca n't wait for happy hour .
0	i 'll start with the pros . -the salon is super clean ! i 'm not sure how long they 've been there but it looks brand new and very pretty . -they have a good selection of polish colors to choose from , mostly opi . ( opi is my favorite . ) -my friend and i went in without an appointment at 5:15 on friday evening and only had to wait a few minutes before being taken to our chairs . -the pedi chairs might be the best i 've experienced yet . they 're super comfy , look brand new and have the most massage settings . -my tech was very friendly ... i mean she did n't talk except to ask me what kind of pedi i wanted but she seemed friendly . on to the cons . i want to say that this first gripe is not something that would normally make or break my experience and honestly it 's something i would have overlooked completely had my service been a great one ... or even a decent one buuuut it was n't so i think it 's worth mentioning . -it 's so quiet that it 's almost uncomfortable . while i appreciate a calm atmosphere , silent does n't necessarily mean serene . it was as if the techs are instructed not to speak at all and without any kind of background music it was awkward for my friend and i to talk to each other . -they have 3 pedicure options , the basic , classic and spa . i got the classic . callous remover , a sugar scrub and hot stone massage are the extras with this one . i asked if i could have the scrub on just my feet because my legs are too sensitive for it . i expected that since it was only my feet for that part she might actually `` scrub '' and apply some pressure . i was wrong and it was the same careless , barely there rubbing ( * that i hate ) even after she rinsed me and applied the lotion to my feet and legs . * this is one of my biggest pet peeves . i 've said it before and i 'll say it again . i can paint my toes and rub lotion on my own feet and legs for free . i pay for pedicures because i want a proper massage . -the hot stone massage ... i 've never had a hot stone massage and i was really excited ! did i get a hot stone massage ? i 'm not sure . i remember her bringing over two stones and i saw them in her hands buuuuut i do n't feel like i can say that i experienced a hot stone `` massage '' she was so fast up and down , up and down that i could never actually enjoy it . picture someone cleaning clothes on a washing board minus actually applying pressure . that was the movement . the only time i could tell she was using stones was when she was going over my shins and that hurt . it felt like , well like someone scraping rocks over your shins . ( to be fair maybe that 's what a hot stone massage is supposed to be . if that 's the case then bravo to her . i suppose it 's just not my cup of tea . ) - the woman doing my friend 's pedi used a drill ! my friend looked over to me horrified ! we 've probably gotten a bazillion pedis together from several places and never have either of us had a drill used on our toes . toenails are little ! drills get hot . you do the math . i want to be clear . my experience here was n't terrible it just was n't good . i did n't leave mortified just slightly annoyed . ( i ca n't say the same for my friend though . ) my toes do look great but i 'm going to stick to 7 day . i would only consider going back to tips & toes if i 'm desperate and just interested in the end result . ( this place is literally half a mile from my work . ) but i would stick to a basic pedi and save myself the $ 8 of `` extras ''
0	great vibe and atmosphere , locally owned/operated , uses fair trade and ( in most cases ) organic ingredients - all wins . however ... as julia noted , the service has dropped quite a bit as of late . i was in this morning to purchase a single cup of coffee to go . the person behind the counter did n't acknowledge my entry ( there were 2 people in the place ) , and i honestly waited more than 10 minutes for her to complete everything else she was doing before she asked what she could get for me ... 10 minutes may not seem like a long time , but when you swing-in while on your way to work , those ten minutes seem like an eternity . especially when it 's for a $ 2 cup of to-go coffee ... she could 've rang-me-up and handed me a cup in a minute or less . and , the cookies have gone downhill big time - hard and crispy rather than soft and chewy ... ick . not sure if i 'll be back - i can buy a whole pound of just coffee from willy street for $ 8 , and if i have to wait 10 minutes for a single cup , i can spend that time brewing it at home just as easily ... sorry , tuvalu - it 's `` toot-a-loo '' for me . best wishes .
0	the new set-up is terrible . the old stand under the trees was great . the new stand in the middle of the compost is terrible . it smelled liked i was shopping for food at the dump . the ambiance carried this place in the past and somewhat justified the high prices , but i will definitely not go out of my way to experience the dirt and dust pile that you have created now .
1	cobra kai is the best gym i ever went to ! ! sim is the best jiujitsu coach in the world i recommend this gym
0	2 weeks after being promised a credit for 1 night , still nothing ! ! ! was on the phone over 45 minutes with no results ....
1	another one of emeril 's top notch restaurants , this one being a steak connoisseur 's paradise . we booked the night before and got in before the traditional 7-7:30 dinner rush . service- top notch . mind you , everything is a la carte.i cant help but feel underdressed even though we were dressed well for the venue . they have an insane wine list that goes on and on . i had the bone-in ribeye which was done to perfection - medium rare . we also had the creamed spinach and wild mushrooms . so good we finished everything leaving little to no room for dessert . definitely should try the dessert since they all looked exceptional , especially emeril 's claim to fame banana cream pie !
0	i want to live this place but it 's hard . the food is fresh and nutritionally smart . the service is nice . but the portions are so small . i ordered the lentil soup and it was almost all water with a teaspoon of lentils . mentioned it to the server and no action . $ 5 for carrot juice but the glass was full of ice . really ? strawberry salad was good if you like lettuce but had a total of three cut up strawberries . so , fox restaurants , stop being so cheap on your food cost ! !
0	3.5 star the storekeeper here at marie is really friendly , she offered me a sample of some tea while i was browsing the store . here you will find good selection of tea and tea wares . and even chocolate that has tea flavour ! i ended up picking up a bar of milk chocolate with green tea & jasmin from morocco ! there is a few tables that you can order a cup of tea to enjoy . good for anyone that are into tea or a place to pick up a gift for any tea lovers !
0	this was my first brazlian steakhouse experience , and as much as i hate chains ( and as american as this may make me sound ) , i wish it would have been fogo de chao . the quality of the meat was questionable and , as i read in a previous review , they were much more generous with the cheaper cuts of meat , only offering up the filet or ribeye if you specifically ask for it . i was also underimpressed with the side dishes . do n't get me wrong , it 's hard not to enjoy a night of eating unlimited meat , i was just expecting a much higher quality experience !
0	overrated . while the food here is good ; it 's not worth the long wait .
0	my fianc\u00e9 and i came here last night ( 7:45pm on a monday ) for dinner and the hostess sighs as we walk through the door and the first thing she says is `` you can sit at the bar or there will be a wait because we only have 4 servers working tonight . '' ... wonderful greeting ... i look around and there were already several families waiting , and over half the restaurant was empty tables because they are severely understaffed and just not seating most of the restaurant . i asked what the wait for a table was and the hostess says `` i do n't really know exactly ... '' just as her manager walks up and loudly whispers , `` just tell people 20 minutes . '' when we decided that we would wait for a table the hostess hands us our buzzer and says , `` just let me know if you change your mind , and ill erase you from our list . '' as if to try and convince us not to stay . my fianc\u00e9 and i just looked at each other , handed back the buzzer and left . i have been here and the food was decent , but the service has always been horrible , and something tells me there is a reason they only have 4 people serving a half empty restaurant . i 'm not one to write a bad review either , actually i do n't know that i 've ever written a bad review , or any reviews for that matter . this experience just irritated me enough to get back on yelp and let others know to go somewhere else .
0	the employees are sooo rude here . i asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response i got was `` no chocolate shake . '' that 's not even a complete sentence .... and they want to make $ 15/hr . ridiculous !
1	the cosmopolitan 's `` grand social experiment '' . it delivers ! walk in to be greeted by five doors . some leading into turn of the century meets star trek rooms , others , well ... spaces morph , the experience evolves , life happens all around you . live bands , eclectic music , spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production , good food , great craft cocktails . you need to experience it to understand . essentially it 's a craft cocktail ultra lounge , stage production , and mega club and restaurant all in one . breaking it down : craft cocktails - excellent , many reinvented , from classics . very consistent ( a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients ) . stage production ( vegas nocturne ) - similar to absinthe . acrobatics , comedy , tap dancing , strip teases . no more details as you are sworn to secrecy . club - still need to experience this . restaurant - inventive and indulgent . many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos ( yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar ) , deconstructed oysters rockefeller ( fried oysters on a bacon butter saut\u00e9ed spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell ) or the tete de cochon ( deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg ) . for larger dishes , the reinvented beef wellington ( beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie , trumpet mushrooms , studded with cream spinach , topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky , latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich . incredible caviar service ( five types sold by the ounce , half kilo , kilo ) . outstanding wine and champagne list . ultra lounge prices . tip ; to make the most of your experience : 1. make a night of it . drinks , dinner , and the show . 2. move through the rooms . there is something different in each . 3. make reservations if you want to eat a full meal . 4. purchase your tickets in advance for the show . do n't skimp . pay the $ 135 for the best seats . 5. shows are not the same . the later you go , the edgier . 6. be prepared to spend $ $ $ $ . the show , dinner , and some cocktails averages $ 300 per person . add some caviar and bottles of wine and it 's easy to drop several dimes . now if only i can remember how alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole .
0	i stayed here with my husband for 3 nights in november . the hotel is pretty nice and the staff is really helpful and friendly . the casino has a great `` natural light effect '' illumination so you always feel it 's noon ! the downside is that it 's really small and i felt there was n't enough waitress to bring you drinks ... so you had to be paying attention to see if a waitress passed by instead of focusing in your sloth machine ... the breakfast buffet was really good ... get there 10mins before 9am and you 'll save like 2hrs of queue ! the shoppes are meh ... definitely go to other hotels and you 'll find better ones ... the rooms are spacious and the bathroom is really clean . the thing that surprised me the most ( and that 's why i took 2 stars off ) was that the last day of our stay , i was looking for an earring that had fallen on the carpet and i saw an old shoe under the bed ! a disgusting dusty old shoe ! ! . that made me feel that they do n't do the cleaning that well ... o_o thank god it was the last day ! i think next time we are in vegas we will definitely stay in another hotel ...
0	overpriced , food was n't very good , the service was only decent . if you go to cadillac ranch go for the eye candy and the bar on a friday or saturday night otherwise you will walk out feeling like you just kissed your sister ... yeah i said it !
0	good for a fast health food alternative than burger king . busy with people and got my food out fast .
0	situated in the heart of the shops at palazzo , this unassuming wine bar offers decent selections at the bar and good to great selections in the shop located adjacent to the bar . bottle prices are a bit high , but that 's what vegas is all about . i was disappointed with the glassware , which ranging from either the o-line series to small bowled glasses with short stems , reminiscent of bad hotel banquets . for a wine bar , i simply expected more in terms of glassware . other than that , the staff was friendly and kept my glass filled ! ! !
1	they do serve alcohol they have a full bar
1	i highly recommend this hotel . not only are the rooms cute , clean , equipped with cooking utensils , and cozy , but the staff are extremely nice and professional . my dog got loose from her leash and sprinted off and dominique and marissa spent 1+ hrs of their time to help me find my dog . they were running and seemed as though they were n't going to stop until they were sure that my dog was back in my arms . thank you so much !
1	i enjoyed a lovely brunch on the patio here with some great companions for great conversation . the eggs were great . all the pastries i tried were divine . the bacon was merely satisfactory . the jelly with the mini donuts was amazing . but , they need to stop calling those things beignets . they were donuts , and by misnaming them i expected something different in terms of fluffiness of the pastry . the bellinis were awesome . wish they served coffee in bigger cups .
1	love cafe rio ! ! ! ! compare to the on on blue diamond which is the worst place i 've been too . i love going to the one near ann rd . the service is fast even when busy , the employees is helpful , nice and they never seem to run out of the queso cheese dip ( my daughters favorite ... she dips her quesadilla in it ) .
0	this place is okay . it 's beautiful inside and our server was great ! if you like hiphop and top hits type of music the do not go on saturday nights the music is horrible and was so bad that we did n't finish our hookah because the music started to sound like noise and just was not fun or entertaining also the dj was some old guy that looked to be in his early 60 's which was kinda whack . and apparently there is some sort of dress code . me & my party was about 9 people and apparently only 2 of us were in dress code . they had on a shirt and pants . they rest of us had shorts on and shirts and maxi dresses .... so i did n't really get that , but they let us in anyway and when we got in it was dead not too many people inside , my guess would be because of the horrible music . the place was kinda a joke .
1	neighborhood delivery and takeout great .... certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level . they do n't biast 30
0	i tried out this place a week ago , what i can say is that while the place is ok , but the food does not scream quality . i am giving it 3 stars because rarely do i leave bad reviews . if you wan na have sushi this is not the greatest place for you to go .
0	the bread is not warm . the half oyster plate had one empty shell so we got 5 oysters total . we ordered the bone in new york steak . i 've definitely had better at lesser restaurants . the service is excellent but the food did not hit the spot .
0	i would like to know where this restaurant got started and do these people have tastes buds where they are from or are they people like the hills have eyes movie and got nuked and now they ca n't taste a thing and eat whatever they can find . do n't bother ordering the grease , they are generous enough to give you ample thin soggy cold fries to soak it up so it wo n't run all over your plate . at least make it thick cut fries , so it at least you can taste some potato flavor not just oil that you fried your chicken in as well . $ 6 ! ? ! ? just for a chicken sandwich , you better put some lettuce , tomato , cheese or bacon on it or something , but nope , you get pickles and two strips of dried up chicken slathered in this grotesque pinkish mayo sauce . i know some of you people like no thrills eating , you 'll eat bread and cardboard and be happy , but it 's just chicken and bread and pickles ! you mean you ca n't slap that together for less than 6 dollars ? oh man , the sauce ! ! ! what were they thinking ? ! you came up with 7 different types of sauce , you can at least make one that tastes half way decent ! i think one is vomit with hot sauce the other is vomit with bbq sauce and the other is vomit with mayo and another one is vomit with vomit , also theres another tangy jerk vomit . there is one bright side to this restaurant are their wings , unfortunately , i must have gotten some deformed handicap chicken cause couple of wings were dried up and one was very tiny . get them dried rubbed , do n't get them tossed in vomit . no sir , ... i do n't like it .
0	yeah , the food here is n't all that bad . i 'd give the food 4 stars by itself . but ... service = shit restaurant = shit normally you get what you pay for , but the prices here are a fucking insane . on my last visit , i paid somewhere around 14 dollars for a cheesesteak , fries , and drink and slice of pizza . the girl at the counter told me a price after i asked her roughly what the total would be ( told me all that would be about 8 bucks ) and after ringing up the total , it was around 14. ok ... when asked what i wanted on it , i asked for wiz but light on it . a few people working there laughed at me . hey fuckers , were not in philly , were in the desert . some of us do n't like that much on the sandwich . a guy making my sandwich spills some steak on the counter , picks it up with his fingers and puts it back on the sandwich . nice . he gives me a `` what is your problem '' look . another lady working there spent the entire time ( waiting in line , ordering , waiting for food , and eating ) looking at her cell phone . anyway , the food is awesome , worth trying if you do n't mind the price tag . sitting in the restaurant to eat itself is cramped . i was lucky enough to get a seat at the `` bar '' that is crooked . my drink falls over . i try to clean it up but there is a line of people standing around me . i give up . the condiment bar looks like a dog gnawed a ton of shit together and left it there . i could n't tell what was what . they were out of ketchup . i did n't even bother telling them . i will agree that the food here does resemble what you get in philly ( minus the pizza , stay away from that . came out cold , told them , they did nothing ) but hardly worth putting up with the fucking service there . if i wanted to be treated like shit i 'll go to work , but i 'm not paying for it . * updated as of 3/17/211 * lowering to one star . decided to give this place a try again and they pissed me off . ordered two slices of pizza before a st. patricks day adventure . ordered to a guy who told me to `` wait a second '' as he was checking his cell phone . for about two minutes . what the fuck ? took my order and i waited . drunk college girls came in after me ( bear in mind , this was around 6p.m . ) and gave my food to them because they ordered the same thing . i wait . again longer . he flirts with them . i ask him about my food . he is checking his cell phone . i hear employees at the soda fountain saying `` we are n't going to have enough fucking ice tonight ! '' as they asked the cook for a kitchen knife to cut ice bags open . cook take the knife back after it is it used for cutting open ice bags and dropped two times on the floor , and hands it back to the cook . i only was able to observe this because i spent the better part of 20 minutes waiting for my food with nothing else to do . he cuts bread with it without washing it . lovely . since they `` forgot '' about my order so john q. cashregister could forget about mine and give it away to try and hook up with college girl customer , my pizza slices were only warmed up for about 30 seconds . the center was cold . a few bites into it , i throw the rest in the garbage . and the napkin dispenser is out . i tell the guy but he is too obsessed with getting pussy . f this place . i hope the owner of this place reads this .
0	no wonder this airline is suffering . horrible rude service . flight attendants looked like they just got out of bed . everyone freaked out with the take off from cabo , the plane suddenly just dropped and the landing was worse . it made me wonder the condition of the pilot as well . it was the worst ! i wish i could give it no starts ..... never again no matter what cost savings
0	i arrived at the restaurant ten minutes before opening . two of the chefs were outside smoking and engaging in inappropriate conversation about what i could only assume was something to do with their ex girlfriend . something about not paying her cell phone bill . i 'm a biker and do n't mind swearing , but it may have offended some other patrons . at 10:57am the doors were opened and i took that to mean that the business was open as well , so i entered . the two chefs aforementioned had gone back inside by that time and where behind the line prepping . after seeing the counter/bar to be empty , i went over to the pass ( kitchen ) to ask if they were open ( again , two minutes before posted time . ) i was told that they were not open for another two minutes and was left to wait at the counter . after the allotted two minutes someone else approached the counter and greeted me . i tried ordering , but they left without warning while i was in mid sentence . passing this guy on the way back to the kitchen was another worker , who seemed to be a bit out of it . he looked hung over . i ordered my food three times because he could n't remember three simple items . i then paid and went to my table . i was given a number and told to place it on the salt/pepper shaker . my food was ready is about five minutes ( ilovebacon burger , fries , and a small drink ) . the burger itself was cooked to a perfect mid-rare , the bacon was still raw . the fries , which were advertised to be home style were frozen and from a bag . when i was given my food , it was from the first guy who walked off on me . he failed to retrieve my number and just kinda slapped the food down and walked off . the long story ; short of this is : if you want mediocre food and terrible service , this is the place for you .
0	this `` grooming center '' is an ok place . i have been there twice for their haircut special . $ 25 buys you a miller , hair-cut , hair wash with shampoo , and a neck rub . which is sounds like a good deal , until you experience it . i made an appointment for 4:30 , and got there exactly around 4:31pm , it took them 20 minutes to get me a seat . i got my beer right after i set on the chair , which is very awkward if you think about it . you have your apron on the hair stylist is staring at you and your one hand has beer mug . it was even more awkward when the hair-stylist decided to give me some time to leave me alone to finish my beer . imagine a grown man sitting there in that barber 's chair with an apron sipping on a cheap beer , while the kid from the next seat over keeps looking at you . i understand that you want to drive men in by offering free beer , but damn who wants to be burpy when someone is cutting your hair . also , i personally think miller is crap beer , so it did n't add to the grand `` experience '' . they really messed up my hair but just taking a clipper to the top , which was a miscommunication on both of our ends . i thought that the woman said clip my hair with scissors , and i did n't realize it until we had passed the point of no-return , that she said clipper . although she did her best to make it look nice , i did look like a franciscan monk half way through the procedure . shampoo and massage was good , but anyone can do that . when your main entree is bad , than no one comes back to your restaurant for condiments . their service needs to improve alot , they are pretending to be old fashioned barber shop , but clearly pit-stop style hair cuts and crap beer wo n't achieve that . you can tell that barber do n't care about best service . just like many worker in america , they are there for a paycheck for shoddy performance . $ 28 ( w/ $ 3 tip ) is not a good value for a franciscan monk hair cut . i can buy a miller , use a clipper , shampoo my hair and use my neighbor 's cat to run around my neck and back area for massage for less than $ 5 . on a bright side they specialize in hair cutting , not plastic surgery . ( 1/5 )
1	bomb ziggityyyy their sushi/seafood section was n't as big as bellagio buffet so it gets 4 stars . other than that , it was soooooooo gooooood ! lamb chops- yum prime rib- yum crab legs- yum and better than bellagio 's make your own crepe station-yum fresh sorbet- yum cheese and cracker section was unique , but did n't try everything is really good ! my friends were going crazy over the corn too . yay for buffets ! !
1	island sushi is the best , great customer service , best place for eat all you can sushi
0	ok kids . lets be honest here - this is not the best poutine place in montreal . what is it then ? well it 's 24 hours and its a damn good place to come after the bar . the poutine gravy could be better , and hotter . but what is amazing is the sheer choices - meet over meet over meat over veggie ( oh yeah , those ) the portions are huge . the options are limitless . my favourite is t-rex when i 'm hammed . so please do come here , but let 's not call it the best poutine in montreal .
1	stacy 's smokehouse came recomended and it lived up to thier words . nicole at the front was friendly and helpful with making the correct choices ... go big , because you 'll come back for more if you do n't . the onion rings and bbq pork sandwich were delicous and i 'll be looking to come back again soon .
0	i used to be a loyal men 's warehouse shopper . i had a casual job and only needed to wear suits sporadically . i have recently taken a job where i have to dress formally everyday . i was in the store to buy a few new suits and am very unhappy with how one of them fits . i feel like a 10 year old wearing my dads suit . it is gigantic . after a few alterations the suit still felt big . when i had it altered initially i mentioned that the suit was huge and the store associate darla said it looked good and they could n't take it in anymore . a few weeks later i wore the suit once and it was horrible . jacket was too long and the pants made me feel like i was wearing a tent . i took it back . they said they could alter it . the staff was not apologetic for not doing it right the first time and overall the team was very unfriendly . like i was an inconvenience in their day . they said they could alter it would cost me another $ 15 and would take almost 10+ days . i will get this suit , but will not be buying anything here again . the sales lady was constantly blaming the other tailors for doing a poor job and said the best tailor was back and that the other tailors were not very good . i will not be back . if this is how your staff treat each other . no wonder the client experience was so poor . epic fail .
1	holy crap what a steak/experience . first off , there should be a disclaimer that this is not like the west hollywood location ... other than the fantastic steaks . this is a lounge/club that serves steak . the music is club level loud and never stops . if you 're in the mood ( which i was ) it 's great . as we waiting for my table we drank and danced . but , you ca n't really have a conversation , so if you 're looking for initmate , avoid at all costs . if you 're looking to warm-up before the club , this is perfect . slash if you are going to be lazy and not go out at all , this is even more perfect ! i get to party sitting down and east maple glazed carrots ? mmmm . yes please .
1	i went with my wife and two year old and the service was quick and friendly ! i wold recommend this place to anyone who loves breakfast items as much a we do . best pancakes ! .
0	hate nothing . dislike space is n't as visually appealing as the other `` snow ice '' competitor . lack of printed menus . order is handwritten on the container . like the strawberry condensed milk . usage of natural ingredients . lighter/fluffier than its competitor . egg pudding as a topping . love nothing .
1	solid beers on tap ( dogfish head 90 min , chimay ) great cocktails and excellent service . thank you daniel .
1	we live in seville , and have been going to the blue32 up on val vista and williams field . we waited anxiously for this to open , and all of the anticipation led to some really high expectations . i 'm happy to report that our expectations have been exceeded twice in a row . last time , we were seated at a table with a server named amanda and we loved her . the food was great ( i had the alfredo pasta , very flavorful ) but my favorite every time is the strawberry daiquiri . they 're made with real strawberries rather than gloppy corn syrup mix , and the taste is miles apart . we could n't remember our awesome servers name this trip ( sorry amanda ) but we wo n't forget because we 've now immortalized her in this review . she 's thoughtful . we had been dithering about what to order ( flatbread ? shrimp poboy ? steak ? ) when a massive party arrived , requiring extra tables and chairs to be brought in , she was nice enough let us know so we could get our order in before they were all seated . we never wanted for a drink or water refill , food was correct and piping hot , and she 's just delightful . also ... fresh strawberry daiquiris ... did i mention that .. ? ? ?
0	i did n't have high hopes for this place considering it 's location , but if there 's a vegan taco to be had , i 'm going to try it . i had some sort of seitan taco and a veggie burrito combo . the taco was boring , served with just seitan , no vegetable to dress it up . the flavors were ok , but i 've had way more exciting tacos . the burrito was big . that 's about all you could say about it . it had stuff in it , but nothing very interesting . i was super hungry , so it was satisfying enough . the server will ask you if you want chips and salsa , say yes . it 's $ 3 and the green is pretty good . red was meh . the food aside , the wait staff seemed to have some serious issues . everyone that worked there seemed to have been hired that afternoon . it was chaotic and an unnecessary amount of people were on the ( tiny , tiny ) dining room floor all at once . the girl `` in charge '' seemed to be about an inch away from a full blown panic attack , and there were only 6 tables . it was a bit stressful to watch . just a warning - if you find reggae music just as unbearable as i do , be prepared . you will hear it here , obviously . i think this place has potential . they need to tweak some menu items , hire a competent waitstaff and purchase furniture that is more than 5 inches off the ground ( seriously it feels like you are on the floor ) . basically , if this place was another restaurant completely , it would be good . it 's byob though ! and cheap ! you park on the street and apparently you should make reservations on the weekends .
0	this club is the least friendly in las vegas . i workout daily and visit six different 24hr clubs throughout the week . i have had a chance to visit all 13 clubs in las vegas . the staff at this location very rarely say hello to me . they never say goodbye to me when i leave . if i get a hello it is unenthusiastic and unprofessional . class instructors range from excellent to adequate . obviously this is my least favorite club . my favorite club is centennial , surprisingly the friendliest club has to be s. rainbow .
0	i will start this review with saying that the garcia on 35th avenue is the only one you should go to .... this location was a huge disappointment ... the only reason i give it a 2 star is because the service was good ... our server was really nice , we had the tortilla soup , salad , and a grande burrito , i think ... let me start with the burrito ... aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside , there was nothing to this ... i think i make 100 % better mexican food than this people , and i 'm from panama -- lol ... now the soup , yak ... horrible and the salad , had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it ... my little one gagged ... i almost complained , but what 's the point , we are never going there again ... better off going to and humberto , roberto , filiberto ... whatever you called those places ... believe me you will never be this disappointed .
1	i was there for a business dinner and they put 5 people at a table for 4 , with me sitting in a chair in the middle of the hallway . there was not enough room at the table for the plates and glasses . i was constantly bumped into all night by other guests and the staff , waiters actually bringing trays over the top of my head . i asked for a change at the beginning and we were offered the exact set up , one table over . the hostess was incredibly rude to me . obviously business is so go here that they can treat people like this and get away with it . i will never go back .
0	i am a huge pottery barn fan . huge ! their furniture pieces are timeless and made to last . you wo n't find veneer wood here . solid heavy pieces that are made to last . my tester ; go up to any piece and start shaking it , if it moves so should you to the next item . i like my furniture sturdy , unbreakable . so with that being said , why a 2 star here for this store in particular ? the service ! actually the store manager truth be told . it 's like the case of julia roberts in pretty woman . yes i dress pretty `` comfortable '' on weekends and i could be mistaken for a 15 year old without a job , but i am still a customer . a customer who just moved in a new house and needs to fill up his house slowly . so when i frequently get snubbed for more affluent looking customers , i just peruse the floor samples and get what i want at pottery barn henderson or online . in my profession , do n't judge a book by it 's cover . treat everyone like family and they will treat you like family .
0	let me start by saying i read the reviews prior go going here . overprice - ehh , it 's vegas , and it 's gordon ramsay , so what . what was constant in other reviews was the service . i thought , you know , worth a try , could be start up pains . well , wow . very disappointed with the front of the house . we had reservations , showed up early , and they were clearly confused looking up reservation on the computer and an ipad , so stand to the side . a manager type ( noted as a manager by not wearing the newsprint jumper mini dress all other hostess were wearing ) asks `` may i help you '' . tell her we were told to wait , she asks for name again , and then with an attitude , tells us , `` for 7:45 '' ( it was 8:25 and we had an 8:30 ) . i reply 8:30 , she walks away without saying a word . eventually we 're seated , smack in the middle of the dining room that is visible from the casino , good table , near a pos/waiter station . 18 minutes later - yes , eighteen , the waiter comes by , politely greets us , asks about drinks , but we did n't have a drink menu . he was trying his best , but good service is not solely the poor waiter 's responsibility . when we placed our drink order , we placed our entire order ( app , 2 entrees ) . bread plates were provided , then breads were brought . breads were finished , so empty crock , tray and 2 small bowls for sauces remained on the table . ( did i mention the waiter station/lsland 6 feet from us ) . our appetizer came , long plate , used our bread plates for serving plates . finished , and now all those plates were still at the table . our entrees came , after having been walked around to the dining room with the beer barrels ( cause i saw the food go by me first , then come back ) . plates were set , we moved our bread plates to the side on top of the appetizer long tray - and there they remained . the only redemption was the food was good . my husband ordered shepard 's pie , which i wish i would have ordered as it was very good . i had fish and chips , which , one of my fish got soggy at the bottom , but another was crispy . i read critiques that the chips were n't authentic - i liked them . my guess if i had to replicate at home , is that you take 1 potato , make it a thick steak fry - so 1 potato = 1 fry ; and they probably use the rest of the sides for the mash , but i liked them . there was another manager type , male this time , ( manager noted by his not wearing the punk suspender type clothes waiters were wearing ) and this guy looked so sleazy . sweaty - seriously , like the kind gordon rips to shred on kitchen nightmares . i actually told my husband it looked like the kn in ny where this godfather type guy wore the trench coat and glasses and they owned a lobster house , and argued with chef about `` maine lobsters '' . this guy seriously went to the table behind me , about 12 times . and please , i 'm not knocking appearance , i 'm not a barbie type person , but i do expect people regardless of age or size , to look presentable , meaning , clothes fit properly , clothes are clean & neat . not sure what the couple did or who they were to warrant attention every 7 minutes , but obviously this clueless manager could n't turn his back and see a stack of empty plates at our table while we were trying to finish our entrees ! almost thru our meal , the waiter came buy , said could i take those plates , since you 've been staring at them your entire meal . again , he was waiting every table in that dining room , and he was hustling , but no support ! at one point when we finished our meal , he ask someone when he saw us finish , to please bus our table - and he did , about 10 minutes later . never did i think a pub meal would take 2+ hours . again , it 's vegas , so yes , it 's over priced , but shamefully not worth it . i wo n't be back . the poor front of house is n't a testament to starting pains , it 's poor execution and leadership . i 'll keep watching the damn shows though !
0	well , i see all the below comments are ditto to mine . 1st time there and i can guarantee the last . the food came cold and no taste whatsoever , the staff was n't any different , that is if you can find them . `` we waited almost 4-5 minutes for someone to wait on us , and when they did rushed us like they had somewhere else to be '' ( oh did i mention there was 1 other table there ) soooo yes it was n't busy at all . to bad in this busy location they wo n't last long either while their competition is ......... across the street `` burger king '' ( not a much better example but a familiar name to all ) iceberg even though it is a national chain `` what kind of rookie name is that '' ... oh yes did i mention freddy 's hamburgers only 1/4 of a mile ( that 's the one to beat ) and no chance in that . not impressed at all ....
1	dr. savitsky and her staff are simply amazing . very stress free environment , made me feel like part of the family . i had 2 crowns and a filling in a single visit . my former dentist had trouble numbing me up , dr. savitsky had no problem . i 'm glad the office staff is considerate enough of the patients that manage ou to get to our appointments on time . i highly recommend this office to everyone i know . i wish i could give more then five stars !
0	maybe my hopes were too high when i made plans to go to sunsplash . i was overwhelmed by the crowd . so many people were crammed into this relatively small space . never in my life have i seen a line for a wave pool . i typically think of the wave pool as a retreat from the lines . not at sunsplash . the lazy river was so packed i could hardly see the `` river '' part . not exactly a relaxing experience . not only that , but the water park seemed less than sanitary . i saw several people with bloody noses , and i could n't help but wonder when the last time they thoroughly sanitized the place . the park is also open at night ... i will not be venturing over to sunsplash after dark . you know what likes to come out at night ? bugs . big ones . ( i 'm a coloradan ... call me spoiled ... but large bugs just are n't a part of life where i 'm from . ) the slides are fun , especially the gigantic ones . if you plan to go on the big slides , be sure to bring your friends ! expect to carry a massive raft up several flights of stairs . there are no mechanisms that bring the empty rafts up to the slide entrance for customers . i got a workout just by hauling our raft around ! whatever you do , do not open your water bottles prior to entering the park . they will throw them out . bring a few gigantic bottles and rent a locker ; a large cup of ice can be purchased at the concession stand for 25 cents . bring cash too . a locker is $ 11 , but you receive $ 5 back when you present your receipt with the locker key . also , i recommend bringing some plastic flip-flops . there 's nothing worse than tromping around dirty grounds covered with strangers ' hairs and other disgusting debris . food is quite pricey ( no surprise here ) . it is a fun place to spend a saturday , just do n't expect anything too elaborate .
0	our driver seemed nice enough . he was a heavy set , young black man . he drove us down the strip and pointed out some sights and gave some advice on where to go and what not . but when we were dropped off at our hotel a young couple collected there bags and did n't tip the driver . he yelled at them and called them names loud enough for everybody to hear . he continued this until the couple had entered the hotel . meanwhile , my boyfriend and i , along with another gentlemen , stood amazed at what we were seeing . when my boyfriend gave him a dollar tip , he rolled his eyes at us . on the shuttle ride back to the hotel , a different driver made sure we had tip money before he let us on the bus ! ! ! tips are supposed to be earned through good service , not bullying .
0	i rarely ever have a good experience at a best buy . i was there the other day and i wanted the fitbit in the light blue color . this is exactly as it is presented on their website . i called the thunderbird location and they did not have it in stock , which is fine . i called this location , gave them the sku and everything , and they said they do have it in stock . when i went down there , the sales associate i dealt with treated me like i was the daftest person on the planet and kept insisting that this color did not exist , even though i called and spoke with someone at the store and saw it on the website . i showed him the website and he walked around the corner and guess where it was . there was no need to be condescending when i knew exactly what i was talking about , and there was no apology . it is degrading to be treated this way by someone who thinks they know everything and has zero customer service or people skills whatsoever on top of it . i spoke to the cashier who asked me if i found everything i needed okay and i said , `` sort of '' and explained the situation . his reply was `` oh yeah , that 's just how he is . '' that 's just how he is ? then fire him ; he should n't be working in the industry . that should n't just be something that is acceptable to them . ridiculous .
1	i decided to go after reading all of the reviews and because i live really close and decided to check it out . i was disappointed with the service , it took us about fifteen minutes + to get a drink . it was probably because there was only one waiter working and the place was very busy . i was surprised how busy it was for a wednesday , but not too surprised after i was actually able to order and eat the food . we ordered the sun roll , phoenix roll and caterpillar roll . the rolls were small , but good . out of the three rolls we ordered , the sun roll was my favorite . the food is great , but the service is slow .
0	how is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway , but ca n't update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at ? i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work . had to call off it was just to cold out !
0	super slow hostess with empty tables . probably not a good idea for lunch . or parties more than 4 .
0	i 'm a snob when it comes to restaurant service . i expect good service and tip accordingly . the service did not disappoint . the food , however , needs some major revamping . i had a half a rack of their supposedly award winning baby back ribs . the meat was dry and had absolutely no flavor . the two sides i ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese . the mac and cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a kraft mac and cheese box . also had the three item sampler : onion straws , fried pickles , and burnt ends . i kid you not , there was literally a puddle of oil under the wax paper in the basket that held the appetizers . tgif 's baby back ribs are much more flavorful and their meat is much more savory . will definitely not be returning to this place . plus one star for the service experienced .
0	i have been here before with my bf and we had a great time with good food ... we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner ( well , lunch actually ) . we got drinks ( waited 10+ mins ) so i 'll knock a star off and they were not very good to boot . we ordered the make your own pasta dish . my boyfriend ordered a spicy rigatoni with meatballs . i got ravioli with marinara . within two bites my boyfriend could tell that there were nuts in it . he has a pretty bad nut allergy so i quickly waved someone down and i believe she was a manager ... she had an accent but never said her name . she told my boyfriend it was his fault . his pasta dish that should n't have contained any nuts ( no warning on the items he chose ) somehow had nuts . she said he should have informed the staff before ordering but really ! pasta does n't usually have nuts ! i 'm allergic to bananas but i do n't go around telling places to keep my spaghetti away from the banana foster , do i ? honestly , she was so rude . i love the goat cheese salad but after that experience we wo n't be going back . the male manager ended up not charging us for the pasta .
1	this is a great place , the food is excellent and the service is great . sometimes there is a wait to get in , but well worth it ! watch out if you park in the front lot , if you park in the spots marked with the signs for the motorcycle shop next to the restaurant , you will get towed , so pay attention to the signs .
1	vacuums here really suck ... literally . have yet to pick up a weak sucker here ... can i say that ? : ) $ 3 gets you a basic wash , but you can shove more money in if you feel like pampering your car with more jets , colorful soap , cloth beaters , and wheel brushes . someone has always greeted me at the pay point and even helped if needed . they seem to have the customer service thing down ....
1	my husband and i tried presto for the first time today and we really liked it ! we had the ahi tuna sliders ( delicious ) and the greek pide ( also very good ) . i had never had pide before and really enjoyed the non-greasiness of the crust . i like pizza but i always end up using a million napkins to soak up the excess grease so the pide was such a great alternative for me . the service was good ( i read a lot of complaints so i was a little worried it would take forever ) . my only complaint was that they pre-make all the salads and keep them in a cooler . i initially wanted to order the ahi salad but i came to pick up the food around 3pm and i just did n't think the salad would be as crisp since it was sitting all day as if they made it fresh to order . i did n't try it though so i ca n't judge . all in all it was a nice lunch and i 'm glad we have a healthy restaurant so close to home !
0	die letzten bewertungen dieses restaurants lagen 2jahre zur\u00fcck . das werde ich bei meiner n\u00e4chsten restaurantwahl ber\u00fccksichtigen . denn nur bei aktuellen bewertungen ist man einigerma\u00dfen vor schlechten \u00dcberraschungen gesch\u00fctzt . mein essen war nah am desaster . das fleisch hatte eine so trockene konsistenz , dass ich vermute , dass es fleischreste waren , die ei fach nochmals verarbeitet wurden . die sauce und das gem\u00fcse waren geschmacklich unterdurchschnittlich . handwerklich und von den zutaten war das eine zumutung . aber dieser reinfall ebnete den weg ( aufgrund des leeren magens ) f\u00fcr meine beste entdeckung in karlsruhe ....
0	the service is terrible and the sushi is n't good enough to compensate for it . every time i have gone the order of at one of the people at the table was incorrect . the staff did n't check back but 3 times for the entire hour that we were there and i had to run my own food back because it was wrong . even though it wrong twice , i gave up . it was n't worth the hassle . i would n't go there if there were a decent place closer that i could talk my friends to change to because they still like going there for some reason ... amendment : i have returned via the request of a close friend and the results were much improved . i found the food was better prepared and the service very friendly . thanks for the improvement !
0	back in the day , circa late 1980s , this was called bullys . not sure if that means anything to anyone but hey , i 'm a fountain of useless trivia ! if you 're a packers fan , which i must clearly state that i am not , this is your place . at least for game watching . lot 's of packers paraphernalia adorning the walls and such . we stopped by here for a pre-dinner drink before heading to nora 's a few doors down . let 's see , a 16 oz draft of cold pbr for $ 2.50 poured by a very nice bartender ... yeah that 's my style . not much for tap selection though , it 's your basic american pilsners plus newcastle brown . did not eat here so no review on the food . they do have a pretty decent sized dining area although i did n't see anyone in there at the time . it 's not the crazy bullys from the heyday , but not a bad place to grab a cold one either .
0	after a horrible experience at hyde , my bachelorette party made its way to the bank on a saturday night . like hyde , they have club promoters , who get groups of women in for free ( score for the ladies ! ) . downside ... no free drinks . still , the place was full of beautiful people and actually has a dance floor . we found a spot to dance and immediately drew the attention of every guy in the vicinity . luckily , the majority of them were engaging and polite and we ended up having a good time , even though the dj could n't make up his mind on what music to play . the bass is also loud here , but if you come with a good group of people , you should have a good time . pros : -most girls get in for free -majority of men are gentlemen , not creepy . -good layout , with actual dance floor cons : -dj is all over the place ! 30 minutes of hard core rap , followed by 10 minutes of top 40 , but only playing 30 seconds of each song . * probably changes nightly -music and bass are too loud , ca n't hear anything else -drinks are expensive
1	i have bad novalash extensions for about 2 years and i heard about this place from a girlfriend . i have to get fills every two weeksand she us getting them only every 4 weeks and her lashes look great . i wash happy to get a money back guarantee in writing and a new set for $ 200 that where softer and totally amazing . the technician have me the look i wanted . they go out of their way to give you what you want because they give you a money back guarantee . that 's a huge thing . the lashes where the fullest extensions i ever bad . i got half minks and half silk . it tool about 90 minutes . i have gone 3 weeks . and have a fill scheduled at almost 4 weeks . i have never gone this long . my lashes look good still . i bad some damage from . my synthetic ladhes but i can see my naturals area returning with these new lashes . i 'm sold . they offer a guarantee . in . writing , the ladhes feel better , look better , do n't damage and last longer than my old ones . my fill at 4 weekend us 80 and i wash paying 60 every two weeks before .
0	wasted my time going there at 658pm friday night when their website said they closed at 8pm .
1	great balkan style lunch menu ! excellent hummus , fresh salad and vegetables and the chicken skewers were also very well seasoned .. but a little bit dry . service was very friendly ! : - )
0	i used to love the veggie sandwiches here until i found out what i was supporting by eating here . jimmy john is one of those people that use their money for evil . he pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to africa and shoot exotic animals . beautiful elephants and cheetahs . google it if you need to see for yourselves . sandwiches are not that damn good . i 'm disgusted . boycott jj .
0	i have eaten here many times and have always received the bare minimum customer service required to be considered a hospitality establishment , but the food has always been good so i continued to go . if you have ever seen the soup nazi on the seinfeld show then you 'll know what i 'm referring to ... if you speak out of turn you will be corrected and even punished with even worse service .... if you order breakfast during lunch time you will be given the dirtiest look from the server and even the cook ( even though they serve breakfast all day ) . i have experienced the worst form of service in my entire life on my last visit ever ... i ordered an omelet at 1:12 pm and i was given the usual dirty look , but this time the server went to the extreme by telling the next customer that she hopes they are n't ordering an omelet too ! ! ! the server wanted me to hear her disgust with my order and the customer was very confused even asking the server `` what 's wrong with the omelette 's ? ) well i got your point and i wo n't inconvenience you and your cooks anymore in the future . very disappointed in michael 's management skills in regards to training staff to treat customers with respect at all times . you might have survived in business for many years , but have you actually thrived ? i think the employees , especially the older lady at the cash register needs to go through anger management and be retrained in customer- service .
0	ug ! having spent time in the philippines i thought it would be awesome to eat here . that was an unfortunate mistake i shant make again ! not even nostalgia could save this train wreck . the food : garlic chicken and pancit ( noodles ) side seemed like they were made yesterday - dry and nasty . the halo-halo ( sweet ice dessert with gelatin and other various mix-ins ) was awful too . the only thing i got that was any good were the buchi ( sesame balls ) but they were way overpriced , and a mango shake that was pretty good . the service : i think the woman that rang me up was a manager and she was so rude right off the bat i should have left but i was hoping to bring back some good memories with tasty grub . definitely should have believed the previous two posts . avoid at all costs ! ! !
0	the food is decent . not bad not great . the service is poor . the teenagers at the front were brats and rolled her eyes when i made a simple request . i ordered a chicken dish and substituted the meat for tofu and they charged me $ 2+ really ? ! tofu is cheaper ! this place is only close to my house . that 's why i ate here . i 've given this place a few shots but it 's not good .
0	if you are searching for `` southern '' style food this is not the place for you . the grits are awful . the grits are a heavy creamy-cheesy-dairy pudding concoction that lacks texture , almost a purred baby food consistency . my biscuit was incredibly dry , bland , and hard . every time i took a bite , it just crumbled in my plate . i also tried the `` fried green tomatoes '' and was very disappointed . completely lack luster , oily and undercooked . the only bright spot about this place is the staff .
0	today i made my first visit to indulge ... the atmosphere is casual and comfortable , and the takeout process was easy . i was craving a great burger , and this almost hit the spot . the brioche bun was soft and the kobe beef was tender , also the toppings were fresh . my complaint is that the burger was really under-seasoned . i do n't need my food to be too salty , but this was lacking any seasoning that i could detect . i think a pinch of salt is all it would have needed to score an extra star . the chocolate malt was tasty , the fries were pretty standard . overall not bad , but not even close to zinburger .
0	i 've passed by this building many times and every time i see it , i get curious and say to myself , `` i want to try that place one day ! '' so when we saw the living social coupons , $ 20 for $ 40 worth of food , my mom and i each bought one ! upon arrival , i asked the server if we would be able to use two living social coupons in one sitting and he told us we could so we decided to order up to $ 80 worth of food . my dad was interested in a glass of wine and the server offered us a special that was half off the bottle so my dad decided to order that since it was a great deal . the food was delicious . we had the spinach and artichoke with crawfish dip and the sampler as our appetizer . they were sooo good ! even the butter for the dinner rolls were to die for ! ! ! and as for our entrees , i wanted the prime rib but they were out so the server suggested the rib eye steak and i am glad i ordered it because it was really yummy . we were having a great time until the bill came and the server told us we could not combine the coupons with the half off bottle deal so we thought that was okay so we decided to just take the coupons . then the server came back again and said he could only take one coupon and not two . that was when we asked to see the manager because if the server had not told us in the first place that we could use both coupons or even suggested the half off bottle of wine , we would not have ordered all that ! when the manager ( his name is scott ) came , he just pointed at the coupon 's restrictions at the bottom and we totally understood that ( we only asked if we could use both in the first place because even though the restrictions state that we can not combine coupons in a single transaction , some places were able to take more than one in a transaction ) but as a manager , what he did next was completely unprofessional . he just said `` okay , let me ask him ( the server ) if he would be willing to pay for part of your wine '' and then he just disappeared into the kitchen before we could say anything else . what kind of manager asks his worker to pay for part of the bill even if it was their fault for misleading the customer ? the server came back out and the manager was never to be seen again . hm , figures . the server told us he was willing to pay for part of the wine because he knew it was his fault and he took full responsibility of it but we told him we did not want him to pay for anything . in the end we just paid our bill and still left him a good tip because at least he was nice , sincerely apologetic , and he was a good server . he just needs to get his information straight . but because of poor management , we will not be returning to this place again , even if we have a second unused coupon .
0	horrible service . no one had any idea what was going on . overpriced . everything took forever to come out . will definitely not return .
0	worst manicure i 've ever received . and yes , i could have done better with my left-hand . ( did i mention that i am right-handed ? ) the first hint was that there were only two people working . yes , on a sunday . how are you not busy enough on a sunday to have more people working ? the lady that did my nails had some sort of tic . she kept looking away- very fast and then back again ... yes , it was a tic . how do you do someone 's nails when you have to keep looking away ? my point exactly . so i had opi- linkin park after dark on my nails that she had to take off . she even did a shitty job of that ! i can see the old polish on my skin because she went downwards when taking the polish off instead of straight . she freaked out over a papercut that i had . really lady ? i do n't have fungus- i have a small paper cut on my finger . ( and you are n't polishing my finger- so pay attention to my nails ! ) i paid before the polish and gave her a 35 % tip hoping that she was going to redeem herself . nope . she polished and said how hard the color was . um , is n't this your job ? then i asked if there was someway she could kinda clean up my fingers since there was polish all over them . i should have stuck to my normal place in northtown to get my nails done . that 30 minute drive there and back is n't so bad ! i 'm sorry that i cheated on you , elegant nail !
0	rather disappointed , ordered the kare-kare , although the meat was tender , vegetables were soggy . the lechon kawali was pretty good , came with the gravy dip and rice . perhaps will give them another chance due to the a/c not working on one of the hottest day of the year 122 deg ,
0	clearly a very disappointing visit to oregano 's . always been a fan of this place , but the quality sure seems to be on the downward spiral . the beefstro salad my ultimate favorite lacked dressing and not much beef i.e . totally lacked the zing . the pasta was very average and the sausage was kept whole on the side , not mixed in and nothing special about the chipolte sauce . in summary very average . i could have gone to trader joe 's got some of their fancy pasta sauce , pasta and sausage and replicated the same . sadly this place is now a hit and miss , as its not my second time that they have come up short . while this chain is growing , keeping quality and service that made them a regular favorite is something that seems to be a challenge .
1	my husband and i hosted our son 's rehearsal dinner at spiedini 's . i worked with tonya to plan the event . she was delightful and very organized . the evening was so wonderful . i had nothing but rave reviews for the food and service from all of our family . there were 60 of us , so that is high praise . the chef , gustav mauler , was terrific and was on site to keep things going smoothly . i recommend them to anyone looking for a wonderful evening and great food !
1	great fun , & great food . usually crowded so get there early . our group tried 4 different entries , and they were all good .
0	i will never bring my stuff here again ! ! they send their stuff out to clean so they take no reponsibility for any damage done to your clothes . if you care about the things you buy i would go somewhere else
0	actually i made a yelp account because this place is such a joke and i had to write a review . i 'm not one for negativity , but i would n't ever go here or recommend it . i eat sushi all over las vegas and this spot is down the street from my house . my mom was in from out of town and i figured we would give it a shot . bottom line . strait embarrassment . horrible service and the fish was n't fresh . ordered all you can eat+drink and it took them 30 min on 3 rolls . we left before our last roll was even done because we could n't stand to wait anymore . best thing was the seaweed salad .... but it was fluorescent green ? ! try yama sushi . you 'll thank me later .
0	i love me some pollo loco , but this location is s.l.o.w ! i came here around 1:45 thinking the lunch rush would be over by then but the line for the drive-thru still looked quite daunting . i decided to wait it out anyway since i was craving some of their spicy avocado salsa . i waited in the line a good 15 minutes before i got my food and was on my way back to work . not horrible , but still a little longer than you would expect from a fast food drive thru during off hours . service was still friendly and efficient once i actually got to the window .
1	was in las vegas for the three day weekend last week and our vegas friends suggested we try nosh and swig for dinner . we were up for anything new and we love trying different restaurants ( especially ones that i can yelp about ) . this nosh and swig is located in a shopping mall and the sign is not to big so you may miss it ! drive slowly and carefully so you do n't miss it because you 'll regret it if you do n't get a chance to taste their delicious bites ! parking was easy , right in the front with plenty of other spaces in the parking lot . it was a sunday night so there was only one other family in the restaurant and we got to sit in the booth in front of the bar and in front of the tv . byron was our waiter ! he brought out some herb/spicy popcorn for us to munch on as we looked through the menu . nom nom . their menu is pretty cool , spiral style and easy to navigate based on type of meat . drinks and dessert towards the end . we ordered the following dishes : 1 ) sticky bun tacos ( fried pork belly . pickled cabbage . ginger soy ) - came with three tacos so if you have four people in your party , someone has to share ! very delicious 2 ) tiger cry ( thai beef jerky . sticky rice . nam prik ) - very filling and they had a lot of meat in this dish ! just enough kick ! 3 ) smokey pok\u00e9 ( ahi tuna . citrus ponzu . norichips ) - a bit spicy but really good ! 4 ) cock-a-waffle-doo cornflake crusted chicken . belgian waffle . blueberry maple reduction - can you say omg so good ! i really liked this one . 5 ) baked & blazed ( fusilli pasta . white cheddar sauce . provencal crust ) . very delicious . i could n't stop eating this one . the cheese is amazing in this dish 6 ) statefair waffle sandwich ( waffle . vanilla ice cream . candy confetti . chocolate glaze . fun for everyone ) - wow what a dessert . this plate took me back to my childhood years and i feel like there was something for everyone in this dessert ! cons : they were out of the short ribs and bbq wings ( sad face ) i also got the mint and basil lemonade which was different and good ! not too sweet and i like the mint addition to this beverage ! overall , the customer service here was superb . i really enjoyed the people and staff that worked here . you can tell they take time to prepare their meals and they have quality ingredients . byron was a great waiter and was super attentive !
0	cheap joint in the middle of the strip where you can cook in your room if you want ... its virtually walking distance to anywhere on the strip and a short cab ride to fremont street . it is also located fairly close to the airport . so it has a lot going for it location wise . however it is a timeshare facility and back when i was married , well i was the co-owner of a timeshare here ... let me just say that the facilities are acceptable but the service is substandard . the parking situation is a royal pita and just pray you are not trying to get your car during the rain . pro tip : request the highest floor you can with a street view ( looking at the carriage house or between buildings sucks ) . their are multiple banks of elevators here which helps dramatically . none the less what they really need are a bunch more of those bell hop carts and a proper unloading/loading area . there isnt really a good spot to do it at . now for the other side of this place . i went to a timeshare presentation here and got so jerked around by these guys that i got a bit upset to say the least . consequently i got one of the timeshare guys bent enough that he wanted to fight . i was in total shock at that type of unprofessionalism . i highly suggest avoiding the timeshare presentation here if you can . these guys will try almost every dirty trick in the book and when you call them out on it , well they get seriously upset with you over it . i just am not one who is ok with being told one thing and given a complete bait n switch and then when i go to verify things , ohhh guess what ... i catch them in the act . these guys are a master of that . i honestly think that kind of activity should cause someone to loose their job and or business license , unfortunately it does not . thank the good lord i never ended up purchasing a place here and just the ex had one . i found out that the maintenance fees were almost the same cost as having a hotel for a week anywhere else on the strip . the only difference being a kitchenette that you had to clean the dishes in . definitely not worth it . but the maintenance fees were over $ 500/yr for a 1 week stay . so if you do the math , to be a partial owner ( granted with a tax deductable deed ) , and the ability to trade your week here for a week elsewhere , it costs $ 71.43 in maint fees per night for a 1 week stay and that is on top of the $ 20- $ 35k initial investment ... it just doesnt sound that worth it to me ... what about you ?
0	staff is very rude . young people with horrible attitudes . a female party host worker yelled at my kids ton get out of her way . i told her i wanted to speak with her manager and she lied to him saying i cursed at her and i should be kicked out . on my sons bday in front of my children . i explained what happened to him and he literally just said `` ok , i 'll look into that '' in the middle of me explaining and walked over to her to hug her and started to joke and laugh about it . but he did make sure to follow me through the course and said if in cursed again i would have to leave . embarrassed me in front of myn kids and everyone . they tried to make me feel uncomfortable the rest of my time there . like teenage little bullies who were given to much authority to fast . this is my first and only visit . my kids love the place but i wont even take the chance to give them another opportunity to treat us that way . horrible customer service .
1	this oregano 's location is always busy , so be prepared for a wait of 30-60 minutes . i 've been here 7 or 8 times for dinner over the past year . the food is always delicious , and the portions are enormous . if you 're looking for good pasta/pizza at a reasonable price , this is the place to go . the bollo pasta and alfredo the dark are two of my favorites . if you want pizza , go with the deep dish -- very rich and flavorful . i 'll be visiting this location many more times during the upcoming year .
1	ate here this past weekend for mine and my best friend 's birthday . we ended up here for a couple reasons . first , it was pretty much the only restaurant with good yelp reviews that was able to take a late reservation for 8 people at dinner time . second , we were staying at ph towers and strip house is in ph . it was n't super busy , but i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised by the food . the steaks were really good . i ordered lobster linguine , which was good , but i should 've just gone for a steak since this is a steak house . almost everyone else got steaks and everyone was very happy with their meals . we also shared 4 sides - mac n cheese , potato romanoff , creamed corn , and fries . they were all decent although not mind blowing . with everyone getting an entree , 4 sides and 2 bottles of wine , our bill came out to $ 80/person . it was expensive , but i can definitely say that we were all happy with the experience and would come back here again . and i repeat .... get the steak !
1	moving from chicago - the land of awesome italian food - i 'm so happy i found this place on a groupon . bruschetta was awesome and flavorful as well and the wine recommended by our server was perfect . the pizza looked awesome ill be sure to try next time , however if you 're in the mood for pasta be sure to get the arrabiata sauce . it 's packed with flavor and not too spicy ! !
0	all i can say is that they give small portions
0	i would maybe come here for happy hour and appetizers but we did n't enjoy our dinner at all . i ordered the chicken piccata and it came literally drowned in butter . i know it 's a lemon butter sauce but it was all butter and very little lemon - and zero flavor . the broccolini was also drowned in butter . my husband ordered the veal porterhouse and guess what ? it was drowned in butter . he said it was also flavorless . the other couple with were with ordered the baked ziti ( huge ! ) and chicken alfredo ( huge ! ) and they were n't enamored either . the food was absolutely terrible , bland and heavy . maybe their plain red sauces are where it 's at , i do n't know . the bruschetta was really good and the service was excellent as well - judging from the other reviews maybe we got lucky with a good waitress . oh , and the valet situation - what a nightmare ! cars parked everywhere , stupid valet kid left someone door open while he ran around so no one could pass ... cars totally bottle necked and stuck - it took us 15 minutes to get through and find parking ! total chaos .
0	in the fast food sandwich market there are many choices based on taste and your pocketbook . take jersey mike 's for instance . they are an east coast brand that has been making it 's trek west for a few years now . on a recent visit i ordered their original italian w/ extra meat and a small soda which came to $ 12.29 . the sandwich was very tasty and came on a 8 '' or so size sub . i 've tried various jersey mike 's along the west coast and they are all uniformly good , ray kroc would be proud . what makes mike 's unique is the grilling of your meat for you sub . they have both a philly and hawaiian options , etc . the quality of the meats and sub bread seem above average as the prices reflect , but still a good sub ! * * * do n't forget to ask for the `` stamp card '' , so you can record your visit * * *
0	free house is located around a growing restaurant cluster around parmenter st in middleton in the old forrestal 's gallery . the building is historic and has been home to many former businesses - the building dates to the 1800s . free house 's beer , cocktail , and separate whiskey menu are extensive . this explains the crowded bar area in the entryway around happy hour on my visit . the food attempts to match other local upscale bar food ( the great dane , the laurel tavern , coopers tavern ) . granted , the crowds i 've seen here are mainly divided into the bar group and families with children in the dining area and neither are likely going to demand fussy hipster ingredients . chicken fingers , a standard burger , and grilled cheese are all available . the restaurant does have sweet potato fries , parmesean fries , and a homemade vegetarian chili , though , so it 's not exactly a country dive bar , either . as a vegetarian , i appreciated the availability of a veggie burger made in-house . i had mine with a side of greens . it was fairly good , though needed some sort of additional moisture from sauce or veggies . my friend 's `` big tex '' burger was loaded with sauce and needed to be cut in half to avoid a bbq fashion emergency . the goat cheese beet salad and fish fry special ( on a wednesday night , no less ) at the neighboring table looked like good bets for next time . service is quick and prices are reasonable . the decor is probably a work in progress but i 'm guessing with time they 'll bring the current `` rec room chic '' up a level or two .
0	i was really disappointed in this place after the consistent glowing reviews . i ordered the sweet crepes with bananas , my daughter got chicken fingers . her food was very hot and mine was cold when it arrived . waitress never came back to refill drinks until i got up to pay check . i just missed all the craze .... it 's like an ihop to me
0	come here if you want to spend $ 50+ per head on burnt , bitter steaks , soggy vegetables and weak sour drinks .
0	honestly , i was not impressed . actually extremely disappointed to say the least ! i had been wanting to stay here and had the chance to last night . the weather got super windy so i decided it was safe for me to stay an extra night and not fly my plane back home to la . i was initially staying at the mandarin oriental and switched over to give the four seasons a try . well i am so sorry that i did . the people at the front desk were `` ok '' . you can tell that they were just being fake and could care less about you . not to mention they were not informative about the property whatsoever . they just sent me on my way . so that was fail a big fail . ok , so then i make my way up to the room . eh , it was alright . it was clean and decent . it looked like it had n't been updated in forever . the only great thing about the room was that the bed was super comfy ( hence the 2 stars vs. 1 ) . after i unpacked i made my way down to the pool . it was nice and everything but the service left little to be desired . i sat and waited and had to flag down several different people before i could order any food . after waiting so long for a server , i decided to order their frozen grapes hoping they would come out pretty quickly . well it took a good 30 or so minutes to just get grapes ! which , honestly , were terrible . after that , i went back up to my room to get ready for dinner because i was still starving . so i chose to try out their veranda restaurant ( italian ) . the food there was fantastic . my only complaint about my experience is that the server was really pushy and kept trying to sell me the most expensive items on the menu , which was quite annoying . ok , so i will just fast forward to later that evening . at about 9:45pm , i called room service to order dessert and coffee . i asked the gal if the chocolate cake was warmed and she said yes since it is served with ice cream . so i agreed to give it a try . well , what do you know the cake shows up cold ( i find out later that she lied to me and that the cake is never served warm ) . then my pot of coffee i ordered was cold and nasty . i know exactly what they did . they took an old pot and diluted it with hot water . i worked in the hospitality industry for years . you ca n't fool me . for a piece of cake and coffee it was $ 40 . i was pissed . so i called and complained . they said they were brewing me fresh coffee and would bring it up right away . but i am a huge coffee person and it still was n't good . oh well . i certainly was not ordering any for breakfast . now it is sunday , today , and i was getting ready to check out . pulled out my valet ticket and noticed they charge an additional $ 22 overnight fee just for that ! i am pretty much fuming at this point . i will never stay here again and i will make sure to tell as many of my friends and family of my terrible experience at this establishment .
1	great location to soak up some drink before you go home to pass out . the staff can be nice or rude depending on you . ( i prefer rude ) the food is good , nothing pretentious or assuming . you get what they give you and you eat it . i do n't think i would bring mom for sunday breakfast but for a quick bite , it hits the spot . better then denny 's unless you want your superbird or french toast . the waitress was even nice enough to call a cab for us .
0	first , the cost for the oil change was too high ; at least twice what i would normally pay at the dealership for the same work ... oh wait it was n't the same work . they cleaned my glass with a dirty rag , did n't really vacuum the interior all that well , topped off all my fluids by spraying most of them ( including the oil ) onto the engine bay , side , and front of the vehicle and failed to close the air filter canister correctly . however , most troublesome is that they did n't bother to pull the skid plate on my 4runner to access the filter correctly . that is a big job for a shop like this i suspect . i would have been happy for them to explain that they do n't normally pull skid plates and offer me the oil change at a lower price ( without filter change ) , but they did n't . so , now i have a skid plate full of oil leaking all over my driveway and i have to pull the plate and fix their inability to be professional .
1	great food , great server , great restaurant . one of the best experiences while travelling in the us ( i am european ) .
1	what 's up with all the bad reviews for this place ? i adore this place ... first off , they 've remodeled and i must say it 's rather lovely inside . but more importantly , the food really is fantastic -- well , if you ordered what i always get : ) i love their starters . the seared scallops ( i have no idea if it 's a regular item or seasonal one ) are ridiculously good ! they are seared to perfection and burst with flavor . i 've also had their crabcakes , and they are divine . the portion is rather small , but the quality speaks for itself . oh ! and the lobster bisque ! ! ! best i 've ever had ... the soup itself was savory and loaded with lobster chunks . to top it off , there 's a wonderful pastry shell that tops the soup . i 'm telling you , get the lobster bisque . you wo n't be disappointed . their steaks are served a la carte , which get 's a bit pricey . but let it be known that these are huge cuts . i had the ribeye done medium rare and it was delicious ! perfectly seared on the outside , with a warm , red tender inside . i could n't be happier with it . i do n't care about the sides , as i 'd rather not waste stomach space , but the garlic mashed potatoes were tasty . now , there is one matter that makes me tempted to knock this joint down a star -- -their desserts are absolutely atrocious ! i mean it ! if you 've read any of my other reviews , then you 'll know that i 'm a dessert fiend and i like my creme brulee .... but boy is the creme brulee here total crap ! the dessert comes with three different types of creme brulee -- choclate , traditional , and i do n't even remember the third . man , it 's gross . it 's super dense and thick . stick a spoon down the middle , and it wo n't budge -- it 's that dense . aside from the rock hard texture , the taste is just off . it 's really terrible . i ca n't image why they would serve such crap . but i 'll be generous tonight and stick to the five stars . but heed my advice -- stay away from the desserts . i do hope that they redesign their dessert menu and put some effort into it . it 's just depressing ! oh , and as for the reviewer who was upset with the $ 150 kobe steak -- i 've been to plenty of places that do n't list the price . and they really do n't tell you unless you ask . heck , i ordered swordfish at another establishment and was never quoted the price ( it turned out to be a whopping $ 45 ) . seriously ... if you 're going to order something that does n't have the price listed to it , just assume it 's gon na cost a truckload of money . i do , and it serves me well . or do n't be afraid to ask . i 've seen the kobe on their menu , and the price is never listed . in fact , i 've seen this at many restaurants . i personally , do n't think that kobe is worth its price . i 'll take a ribeye or porterhouse anyday .
0	the absolute worst customer service . i spent $ 156 in rc parts to include a set of traxxas jato front and rear wheel sets as a christmas present to a family member . as it turns out , the wheel set was purchased in error and asked for a refund ( $ 33/set ) . upon calling the day after christmas to see if the store was open , i was surprised at the lack of customer service and overall rudeness of the store manager ( for which his father is the owner ) . he said , `` do n't you read the reciept ... no exchanges for store credit only '' . i said that how would i know that if the reciept is handed to me after the purchase ... not before . he then said , `` it 's a store policy not to provide refunds ... it 's written on the back of our register '' . again , i do n't normally read everything posted in a store . why did n't they inform me verbally of this policy before purchasing the items ? the overall demeanor of this guy was absolutely unacceptable and i will never buy another product from this store again ! i would never recommend anyone to go there . you 'll find prices and service much cheaper online . read these reviews and you 'll see that hobby town usa in gilbert arizona do n't deserve our business . i ususally do n't bother with reviews , but these people pushed me over the line .... i will do my best to place my honest review in every site available to expose the truth about this business . next call will be to the hobby town corporate office ... they need to know that their name is being trashed in az .
0	so my first visit to this place , my girlfriend and i were meeting to catch up . she has been here before and i anticipate bringing my husband if all is good . i am very excited . we arrived right when they opened , so to see the influx of people appearing at the door after we were seated was encouraging . service was fine and basically what you would expect . i ordered the catfish po boy and fries . nice soft bread , lettuce , tomatoes and a tasty sauce ... but where 's the fish ? ? ? ? ? i mean would you pay 11.00 bucks for a mcdonald size fish filet split in half ? i did ask our server if this was the normal portion , and apparently so . i was more disappointed cuz i 've so wanted to report back home how good things were and plan a second trip with my hubby . i was also still hungry . my po boy was `` very po '' and lacked flavor too . but i give anyplace a second chance . but i have a plan . i 'll order the catfish platter and some bread on the side and hope my hubby has a different experience . this is my very first post , so lola 's at least inspired me .
1	we went at around 3:10 and got to eat the lunch menu ( with kobe beef balls , st. lous style ribs , fried chicken , etc . ) and then we got to eat their dinner menu at 3:30 with crab legs , cocktail shrimps , mussels , lamb , etc. ) . i 've eaten at bellagio and mirage and this place totally blew them out of the water . you get what you pay for and this place certainly gives you what you pay for . almost everything tasted great here . you can really taste the quality and time that the chefs put into creating and cooking the dishes that they have . i could eat here everyday ! ! ! : )
